Forward-Looking Statements

We have included in or incorporated by reference into this report, and from time to time may make in our public filings, press releases or
other public statements, certain statements, including (without limitation) those under “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in
Part II, Item 7 and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A, that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, our management may make forward-looking statements to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts and represent only
our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control.

The nature of our
business makes predicting the future trends of our revenues, expenses and net income difficult. The risks and uncertainties involved in our businesses could affect the matters referred to in such statements, and it is possible that our actual
results may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results indicated in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements include (without
limitation):

•

the effect of economic and political conditions and geopolitical events, including the United Kingdom’s
(the “U.K.”) anticipated withdrawal from the European Union (the “E.U.”);

•

sovereign risk;

•

the effect of market conditions, particularly in the global equity, fixed income, currency, credit and
commodities markets, including corporate and mortgage (commercial and residential) lending and commercial real estate markets and energy markets;

•

the impact of current, pending and future legislation (including with respect to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”)) or changes thereto, regulation (including capital, leverage, funding, liquidity and tax requirements), policies (including fiscal and monetary policies established by central
banks and financial regulators, and changes to global trade policies), and other legal and regulatory actions in the United States of America (“U.S.”) and worldwide;

•

the level and volatility of equity, fixed income and commodity prices (including oil prices), interest rates,
currency values and other market indices;

•

the availability and cost of both credit and capital as well as the credit ratings assigned to our unsecured
short-term and long-term debt;

•

investor, consumer and business sentiment and confidence in the financial markets;

•

the performance and results of our acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, strategic alliances or other
strategic arrangements;

•

our reputation and the general perception of the financial services industry;

•

inflation, natural disasters, pandemics and acts of war or terrorism;

•

the actions and initiatives of current and potential competitors as well as governments, central banks,
regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

•

the effectiveness of our risk management policies;

•

technological changes instituted by us, our competitors or counterparties and technological risks, including
cybersecurity, business continuity and related operational risks;

•

our ability to provide innovative products and services and execute our strategic objectives; and

•

other risks and uncertainties detailed under “Business—Competition” and
“Business—Supervision and Regulation” in Part I, Item 1, “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere throughout this report.

Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are
made. We undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the dates they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise except as required by applicable law. You should, however, consult further disclosures we may make in future filings of our Annual Reports on Form

Part I

Item 
1. Business

Overview

We are a global financial services firm that, through our subsidiaries and affiliates, advises, and originates, trades, manages and
distributes capital for, governments, institutions and individuals. We were originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1981, and our predecessor companies date back to 1924. We are a financial holding company
(“FHC”) regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). We conduct our business from our headquarters in
and around New York City, our regional offices and branches throughout the U.S. and our principal offices in London, Tokyo, Hong Kong and other world financial centers. As of December 31, 2016, we had 55,311 employees worldwide. Unless the
context otherwise requires, the terms “Morgan Stanley,” the “Firm,” “us,” “we,” and “our” mean Morgan Stanley (the “Parent Company”) together with its consolidated subsidiaries.

Financial information concerning us, our business segments and geographic regions for each of the 12 months ended December 31, 2016,
December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 is included in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Part II, Item 8.

Business Segments

We are a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of our business segments—Institutional
Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management. Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we provide a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments,
financial institutions and individuals. Additional information related to our business segments, respective clients, and products and services provided is included under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7.

Competition

All aspects of our businesses are highly competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete in the U.S. and globally for clients, market
share and human talent. Operating within the financial services industry on a global basis presents, among other things, technological, risk management, regulatory and other infrastructure challenges that

require effective resource allocation in order for us to remain competitive. Our competitive position depends on our reputation and the quality and consistency of our long-term investment
performance. Our ability to sustain or improve our competitive position also depends substantially on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified employees while managing compensation and other costs. We compete with commercial
banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, electronic trading and clearing platforms, financial data repositories, sponsors of mutual funds, hedge funds and private equity funds, energy companies and other companies offering financial or ancillary
services in the U.S., globally and through the internet. In addition, restrictive laws and regulations applicable to certain U.S. financial services institutions, such as Morgan Stanley, which may prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions
and impose more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, can put us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors in certain businesses not subject to these same requirements. See also “—Supervision and Regulation” below and
“Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.

Institutional Securities and Wealth Management

Our competitive position for our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments depends on innovation, execution capability
and relative pricing. We compete directly in the U.S. and globally with other securities and financial services firms and broker-dealers and with others on a regional or product basis. Additionally, there is increased competition driven by
established firms as well as the emergence of new firms and business models (including innovative uses of technology) competing for the same clients and assets or offering similar products and services.

Our ability to access capital at competitive rates (which is generally impacted by our credit ratings), to commit and to deploy capital
efficiently, particularly in our capital-intensive underwriting and sales, trading, financing and market-making activities, also affects our competitive position. Corporate clients may request that we provide loans or lending commitments in
connection with certain investment banking activities and such requests are expected to continue.

It is possible that competition may
become even more intense as we continue to compete with financial institutions that may be larger, or better capitalized, or may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history in certain geographies or products. Many of these firms have
the ability to offer a wide range of products and services that may enhance their competitive position and could result in pricing pressure on our businesses. In addition, our business is subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and abroad, while
certain of our competitors may be subject to less stringent legal and regulatory regimes than us, thereby putting us at a competitive disadvantage.


December 2016 Form 10-K


We continue to experience intense price competition in some of our businesses. In particular,
the ability to execute securities trades electronically on exchanges and through other automated trading markets has increased the pressure on trading commissions and comparable fees. The trend toward direct access to automated, electronic markets
will likely increase as additional trading moves to more automated platforms. It is also possible that we will experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing
prices (in the form of commissions or pricing).

Investment Management

Our ability to compete successfully in the asset management industry is affected by several factors, including our reputation, investment
objectives, quality of investment professionals, performance of investment strategies or product offerings relative to peers and appropriate benchmark indices, advertising and sales promotion efforts, fee levels, the effectiveness of and access to
distribution channels and investment pipelines, and the types and quality of products offered. Our investment products, including alternative investment products, may compete with investments offered by other investment managers with passive
investment products or who may be subject to less stringent legal and regulatory regimes than us.

Supervision and Regulation

As a major financial services firm, we are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and
securities exchanges and by regulators and exchanges in each of the major markets where we conduct our business. Moreover, in response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis, legislators and regulators, both in the U.S. and worldwide, have adopted,
continue to propose or are in the process of implementing a wide range of reforms that have resulted or that may in the future result in major changes to the way we are regulated and conduct our business. These reforms include the Dodd-Frank Act;
risk-based capital, leverage and liquidity standards adopted or being developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”), including Basel III, and the national implementation of those standards; capital
planning and stress testing requirements; and new resolution regimes that are being developed in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. While certain portions of these reforms are effective, others are still subject to final rulemaking or transition
periods.

We continue to monitor the changing political, tax and regulatory environment; it is likely that there will be further material
changes in the way major financial institutions are regulated in both the U.S. and other markets in which we operate,

although it remains difficult to predict the exact impact these changes will have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for a particular future period.

Financial Holding Company

Consolidated Supervision.

We have operated as a bank holding company and FHC under the BHC Act since September
2008. As a bank holding company, we are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. Under existing regulation, the Federal Reserve has heightened authority to examine, prescribe regulations
and take action with respect to all of our subsidiaries. In particular, we are, or will become, subject to (among other things): significantly revised and expanded regulation and supervision; more intensive scrutiny of our businesses and plans for
expansion of those businesses; new activities limitations; a systemic risk regime that imposes heightened capital and liquidity requirements; restrictions on activities and investments imposed by a section of the BHC Act added by the Dodd-Frank Act
referred to as the “Volcker Rule”; and comprehensive derivatives regulation. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has primary rulemaking, enforcement and examination authority over us and our subsidiaries with respect to
federal consumer protection laws, to the extent applicable.

Scope of Permitted Activities.

The BHC Act
limits the activities of bank holding companies and financial holding companies and grants the Federal Reserve authority to limit our ability to conduct activities. We must obtain the Federal Reserve’s approval before engaging in certain
banking and other financial activities both in the U.S. and internationally. Since becoming a bank holding company, we have disposed of certain nonconforming assets and conformed certain activities to the requirements of the BHC Act.

The BHC Act grandfathers “activities related to the trading, sale or investment in commodities and underlying physical properties,”
provided that we were engaged in “any of such activities as of September 30, 1997 in the United States” and provided that certain other conditions that are within our reasonable control are satisfied. We currently engage in our
commodities activities pursuant to the BHC Act grandfather exemption as well as other authorities under the BHC Act.

Activities
Restrictions under the Volcker Rule.

The Volcker Rule prohibits “banking entities,” including the Firm and its affiliates, from engaging in certain “proprietary trading” activities, as defined in the
Volcker Rule, subject to exemptions for underwriting, market-making-related activities, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. The Volcker Rule also prohibits certain investments and relationships by banking entities with
“covered funds,” with a number of

December 2016 Form 10-K



exemptions and exclusions. Banking entities were required to bring all of their activities and investments into conformance with the Volcker Rule by July 21, 2015, subject to certain
extensions. For more information about the conformance periods applicable to certain covered funds, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital
Resources—Regulatory Developments.” In addition, the Volcker Rule requires banking entities to have comprehensive compliance programs reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the Volcker Rule.

The Volcker Rule also requires that deductions be made from a bank holding company’s Tier 1 capital for certain permissible investments
in covered funds. Beginning with the three months ended September 30, 2015, the required deductions are reflected in our relevant regulatory capital tiers and ratios. Given its complexity, the full impact of the Volcker Rule is still uncertain
and will ultimately depend on the interpretation and implementation by the five regulatory agencies responsible for its oversight.

Capital Standards.

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for large bank holding companies and
evaluates our compliance with such requirements. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. bank subsidiaries, Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. (“MSBNA”)
and Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association (“MSPBNA”) (collectively, “U.S. Bank Subsidiaries”).

Regulatory Capital Framework.

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for large bank holding
companies, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates our compliance with such capital requirements. The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. The regulatory capital requirements are
largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. After completion of certain transitional arrangements in the regulatory capital framework, we will be
subject to various risk-based capital requirements, measured against our Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital bases, leverage-based capital requirements, including the Supplementary Leverage Ratio, and additional capital
buffers above generally applicable minimum standards for bank holding companies.

The Basel Committee is in the process of considering
revisions to various provisions of the capital framework that, if adopted by the U.S. banking agencies, could result in substantial changes to our regulatory capital framework.

Regulated Subsidiaries.

In addition, many of our regulated
subsidiaries are, or are expected to be in the future, subject to regulatory capital requirements, including regulated subsidiaries registered as “swap dealers” with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) or
“security-based swap dealers” with the SEC (collectively, “Swaps Entities”) or registered as broker-dealers or futures commission merchants. Specific regulatory capital requirements vary by regulated subsidiary, and in many cases
these standards are not yet established or are subject to ongoing rulemakings that could substantially modify requirements.

Commodities-Related Capital Requirements.

In September 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rulemaking
that would increase risk-based capital requirements for certain commodities-related activities and commodities-related merchant banking investments of U.S. FHCs, including the Firm; impose new limitations on the physical commodity trading activities
of certain U.S. FHCs; and enhance reporting requirements with respect to U.S. FHCs’ commodities-related activities and investments. If adopted in its current form, the proposed rulemaking would result in increases in our risk-weighted assets
(“RWAs”) with respect to certain commodities-related investments and physical commodity holdings. However, we expect that the proposed rule, if finalized in its proposed form, would not have a material impact on our aggregate RWAs or
risk-based capital ratios.

For more information about the specific capital requirements applicable to us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries,
see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements” in Part II, Item 7.

Capital Planning, Stress Tests and Capital Distributions.

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve
has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large bank holding companies, including Morgan Stanley. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires each of our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to conduct an annual stress test. For more information about
the capital planning and stress test requirements, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements” in Part II, Item 7.

In addition to capital planning requirements, the OCC, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(“FDIC”) have the authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Firm and its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend
would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. All of these


December 2016 Form 10-K


policies and other requirements could affect our ability to pay dividends and/or repurchase stock, or require us to provide capital assistance to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under circumstances
which we would not otherwise decide to do so.

Liquidity Standards.

In addition to capital regulations, the
U.S. banking agencies and the Basel Committee have adopted, or are in the process of considering, liquidity standards. The Basel Committee has developed two standards intended for use in liquidity risk supervision, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio
(“LCR”) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”). The Firm and its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are subject to the LCR requirements issued by the U.S. banking regulators (“U.S. LCR”) and would be subject to the NSFR
requirements proposed by the U.S. banking regulators (“U.S. NSFR”).

In addition to the U.S. LCR and U.S. NSFR, we and many of
our regulated subsidiaries, including those registered as Swaps Entities with the CFTC or SEC, are, or are expected to be in the future, subject to other liquidity standards, including liquidity stress-testing and associated liquidity reserve
requirements.

For more information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Liquidity Framework” in Part II, Item 7.

Systemic Risk
Regime.

The Dodd-Frank Act established a systemic risk regime to which bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets, such as Morgan Stanley, are subject. Under rules issued by the Federal
Reserve to implement certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act’s enhanced prudential standards, such bank holding companies must conduct internal liquidity stress tests, maintain unencumbered highly liquid assets to meet projected net cash
outflows for 30 days over the range of liquidity stress scenarios used in internal stress tests, and comply with various liquidity risk management requirements. Institutions also must comply with a range of risk management and corporate governance
requirements.

In March 2016, the Federal Reserve

re-proposed

rules that would establish
single-counterparty credit limits for large banking organizations (“covered companies”), with more stringent limits for the largest covered companies. U.S. global systemically important banks

(“G-SIBs”),

including the Firm, would be subject to a limit of 15% of Tier 1 capital for credit exposures to any “major counterparty” (defined as other U.S.

G-SIBs,

foreign

G-SIBs

and nonbank systemically important financial institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve) and to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital for credit
exposures to any other unaffiliated counterparty. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules.

In addition, the Federal Reserve has proposed rules that would create a new early remediation
framework to address financial distress or material management weaknesses. The Federal Reserve also has the ability to establish additional prudential standards, including those regarding contingent capital, enhanced public disclosures and limits on
short-term debt, including

off-balance

sheet exposures. For example, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital
Resources—Regulatory Requirements—Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity and Long-Term Debt Requirement” in Part II, Item 7.

Under the systemic risk regime, if the Federal Reserve or the Financial Stability Oversight Council determines that a bank holding company
with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets poses a “grave threat” to U.S. financial stability, the institution may be, among other things, restricted in its ability to merge or offer financial products and required to terminate
activities and dispose of assets.

“—Resolution and Recovery Planning” below.

Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC an annual resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or
failure. Our preferred resolution strategy, which is set out in our 2015 resolution plan, is a single point of entry (“SPOE”) strategy. An SPOE strategy generally contemplates the provision of additional capital and liquidity by the Parent
Company to certain of its subsidiaries so that such subsidiaries have the resources necessary to implement the resolution strategy after the Parent Company has filed for bankruptcy.

Further, we are required to submit an annual recovery plan to the Federal Reserve that outlines the steps that management could take over time
to generate or conserve financial resources in times of prolonged financial stress.

Certain of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries are
also subject to resolution and recovery planning requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. For example, MSBNA must submit to the FDIC an annual resolution plan that describes MSBNA’s strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution in
the event of material financial distress or failure of MSBNA. In September 2016, the OCC issued final guidelines that establish enforceable standards for recovery planning by national banks and certain other institutions with total consolidated
assets of $50 billion or more, calculated on a rolling four-quarter average basis, including MSBNA. The guidelines were effective on January 1, 2017, and MSBNA must be in compliance by January 1, 2018.

In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain financial companies, including bank holding
companies such as the Firm and certain of its covered subsidiaries, can be subjected to a resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act with the FDIC being appointed as receiver, provided that
certain procedures are met, including certain extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk determinations by the U.S. Treasury Secretary in consultation with the U.S. President. The orderly liquidation authority rulemaking is proceeding in
stages, with some regulations now finalized and others not yet proposed. If we were subject to the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would have considerable powers, including: the power to remove directors and officers responsible for our
failure and to appoint new directors and officers; the power to assign our assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review; the ability to differentiate among our
creditors, including by treating certain creditors within the same class better than others, subject to a minimum recovery right on the part of disfavored creditors to receive at least what they would have received in bankruptcy liquidation; and
broad powers to administer the claims process to determine distributions from the assets of the receivership. The FDIC has been developing an SPOE strategy that could be used to implement the orderly liquidation authority.

Regulators have taken and proposed various actions to facilitate an SPOE strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the orderly liquidation
authority or other resolution regimes. For more information about our resolution plan-related submissions and associated regulatory actions, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Regulatory Requirements—Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Developments—Resolution and Recovery Planning” in Part II, Item 7.

Cyber Risk Management.

As a general matter, the financial services industry faces increased regulatory focus
regarding cyber risk management practices. In October 2016, the federal banking regulators issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding enhanced cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial
institutions and their third-party service providers, including the Firm. The proposed standards would expand existing cybersecurity regulations and guidance to focus on cyber risk governance and management; management of internal and external
dependencies; and incident response, cyber resilience and situational awareness. In addition, the proposal contemplates more stringent standards for institutions with systems that are critical to the financial sector.

U.S. Bank Subsidiaries

U.S. Bank Subsidiaries.

MSBNA, primarily a wholesale commercial bank, offers commercial lending and certain
retail securities-based lending services in addition to deposit products, and also conducts certain foreign exchange activities.

MSPBNA
offers certain mortgage and other secured lending products, including retail securities-based lending products, primarily for customers of our affiliate retail broker-dealer, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“MSSB LLC”). MSPBNA also offers
certain deposit products and prime brokerage custody services.

Both MSBNA and MSPBNA are FDIC-insured national banks subject to
supervision, regulation and examination by the OCC. They are both subject to the OCC’s risk governance guidelines, which establish heightened standards for a large national bank’s risk governance framework and the oversight of that
framework by the bank’s board of directors.

Prompt Corrective Action.

The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates, including parent holding companies, by their federal banking regulators. Among other things, it requires the relevant federal
banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” (“PCA”) with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. Current PCA regulations generally apply only to insured
banks and thrifts such as MSBNA or MSPBNA and not to their parent holding companies. The Federal Reserve is, however, authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level, subject to certain limitations. Under the systemic risk regime,
as described above, we also would become subject to an early remediation protocol in the event of financial distress. In addition, bank holding companies, such as Morgan Stanley, are required to serve as a source of strength to their U.S. bank
subsidiaries and commit resources to support these subsidiaries in the event such subsidiaries are in financial distress.

Transactions
with Affiliates.

Our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which impose restrictions on “covered transactions” with any affiliates. Covered transactions include
any extension of credit to, purchase of assets from, and certain other transactions by insured banks with an affiliate. These restrictions limit the total amount of credit exposure that our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries may have to any one affiliate and to
all affiliates. Other provisions set collateral requirements and require all such transactions to be made on market terms. Derivatives, securities borrowing and securities lending transactions between our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries and their affiliates
are


December 2016 Form 10-K


subject to these restrictions. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it will propose a rulemaking to implement these more recent restrictions.

In addition, the Volcker Rule generally prohibits covered transactions between (i) us or any of our affiliates and (ii) covered
funds for which we or any of our affiliates serves as the investment manager, investment adviser, commodity trading advisor or sponsor, or other covered funds organized and offered by us or any of our affiliates pursuant to specific exemptions in
the Volcker Rule. See also “—Financial Holding Company—Activities Restriction under the Volcker Rule” above.

FDIC
Regulation.

An FDIC-insured depository institution is generally liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the FDIC in connection with the failure of an insured depository institution under common control
by the same bank holding company. As commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institutions, each of MSBNA and MSPBNA could be responsible for any loss to the FDIC from the failure of the other. In addition, both institutions are exposed to
changes in the cost of FDIC insurance. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, some of the restoration of the FDIC’s reserve fund must be paid for exclusively by large depository institutions, including MSBNA.

Institutional Securities and Wealth Management

Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation.

Our primary U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, Morgan
Stanley & Co. LLC (“MS&Co.”) and MSSB LLC, are registered broker-dealers with the SEC and in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and are members of various self-regulatory
organizations, including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”), and various securities exchanges and clearing organizations. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities
business, including sales and trading practices, securities offerings, publication of research reports, use of customers’ funds and securities, capital structure, risk management controls in connection with market access, recordkeeping and
retention, and the conduct of their directors, officers, representatives and other associated persons. Broker-dealers are also regulated by securities administrators in those states where they do business. Violations of the laws and regulations
governing a broker-dealer’s actions could result in censures, fines, the issuance of

cease-and-desist

orders, revocation of licenses or registrations, the
suspension or expulsion from the securities industry of such broker-dealer or its officers or employees, or other similar consequences by both federal and state securities administrators. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are also members of the
Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which provides certain protections for customers of broker-dealers against losses in the event of the insolvency of a broker-dealer.

MSSB LLC is also a registered investment adviser with the SEC. MSSB LLC’s relationship with
its investment advisory clients is subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed on investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder as well as various state securities
laws. These laws and regulations generally grant the SEC and other supervisory bodies broad administrative powers to address

non-compliance,

including the power to restrict or limit MSSB LLC from carrying on
its investment advisory and other asset management activities. Other sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain activities for specified periods of time or for specified types of
clients, the revocation of registrations, other censures and significant fines.

The Firm is subject to various regulations that affect
broker-dealer sales practices and customer relationships. For example, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC is authorized to impose a fiduciary duty rule applicable to broker-dealers when providing personalized investment advice about securities to
retail customers, although the SEC has not yet acted on this authority.

As a separate matter, in April 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor
adopted a conflict of interest rule under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 that broadens the circumstances under which a firm and/or financial adviser is considered a fiduciary when providing certain recommendations to retirement
investors and requires that such recommendations be in the best interests of clients. Subject to any potential delays, the new fiduciary standard for investment advice has a scheduled applicability date of April 10, 2017, with certain aspects
subject to

phased-in

compliance, and with full compliance required by January 1, 2018. Given the breadth and scale of our platform and continued investment in technology and infrastructure, we believe
that we will be able to provide compliant solutions to meet our clients’ investment needs. However, these developments may impact the manner in which affected businesses are conducted, decrease profitability and increase potential litigation or
enforcement risk.

Margin lending by broker-dealers is regulated by the Federal Reserve’s restrictions on lending in connection with
customer and proprietary purchases and short sales of securities, as well as securities borrowing and lending activities. Broker-dealers are also subject to maintenance and other margin requirements imposed under FINRA and other self-regulatory
organization rules. In many cases, our broker-dealer subsidiaries’ margin policies are more stringent than these rules.

As
registered U.S. broker-dealers, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to the SEC’s net capital rule and the net capital requirements of various exchanges, other regulatory
author-

December 2016 Form 10-K



ities and self-regulatory organizations. These rules are generally designed to measure the broker-dealer subsidiary’s general financial integrity and/or liquidity and require that at least a
minimum amount of net and/or liquid assets be maintained by the subsidiary. See also “—Financial Holding Company—Consolidated Supervision” and “—Financial Holding Company—Liquidity Standards” above. Rules of
FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations also impose limitations and requirements on the transfer of member organizations’ assets.

Research.

Both U.S. and

non-U.S.

regulators continue to focus on
research conflicts of interest. Research-related regulations have been implemented in many jurisdictions, including in the U.S. where FINRA has adopted rules that cover both equity and debt. New and revised requirements resulting from these
regulations and the global research settlement with U.S. federal and state regulators (to which we are a party) have necessitated the development or enhancement of corresponding policies and procedures.

Regulation of Futures Activities and Certain Commodities Activities.

MS&Co., as a futures commission
merchant, and MSSB LLC, as an introducing broker, are subject to net capital requirements of, and certain of their activities are regulated by, the CFTC, the National Futures Association (the “NFA”), CME Group, and various commodity
futures exchanges. MS&Co. and MSSB LLC and certain of their affiliates are registered members of the NFA in various capacities. Rules and regulations of the CFTC, NFA and commodity futures exchanges address obligations related to, among other
things, customer protections, the segregation of customer funds and the holding of secured amounts, the use by futures commission merchants of customer funds, recordkeeping and reporting obligations of futures commission merchants, and introducing
brokers, risk disclosure, risk management and discretionary trading.

Our commodities activities are subject to extensive and evolving
energy, commodities, environmental, health and safety, and other governmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad. Intensified scrutiny of certain energy markets by U.S. federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and abroad and by the
public has resulted in increased regulatory and legal enforcement and remedial proceedings involving companies conducting the activities in which we are engaged. See also “—Financial Holding Company—Scope of Permitted Activities”
and “—Capital Standards—Commodities-Related Capital Requirements” above.

Derivatives
Regulation.

Under the U.S. regulatory regime for “swaps” and “security-based swaps” (collectively, “Swaps”) implemented pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we

are subject to regulations including, among others, public and regulatory reporting, central clearing and mandatory trading on regulated exchanges or execution facilities for certain types of
Swaps. While the CFTC has completed the majority of its regulations in this area, most of which are in effect, the SEC has not yet adopted a number of its Swaps regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the registration of “swap
dealers” with the CFTC and “security-based swap dealers” with the SEC. Certain of our subsidiaries have registered with the CFTC as swap dealers and will in the future be required to register with the SEC as security-based swap
dealers. Such Swaps Entities are or will be subject to a comprehensive regulatory regime with new obligations for the Swaps activities for which they are registered, including capital requirements, margin requirements for uncleared Swaps and
comprehensive business conduct rules. Each of the CFTC and the SEC have proposed rules to impose capital standards on Swaps Entities subject to their respective jurisdictions, which include our subsidiaries, but these rules have not yet been
finalized.

The specific parameters of some of these requirements for Swaps have been and continue to be developed through the CFTC, SEC
and bank regulator rulemakings. In 2015, the federal banking regulators and the CFTC separately issued final rules establishing uncleared Swap margin requirements for Swaps Entities subject to their respective regulation, including MSBNA, Morgan
Stanley Capital Services LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc (“MSIP”), respectively. These final rules impose variation margin requirements under a

phase-in

compliance schedule
that applied to the largest dealers as of September 1, 2016 and will apply to the remainder of

in-scope

market participants as of March 1, 2017. Similarly, the final rules

phase-in

initial margin requirements from September 1, 2016 through September 1, 2020, depending on the level of

over-the-counter

(“OTC”) derivatives activity of the swap dealer and the relevant counterparty. Margin rules with the same or similar compliance dates have
been adopted or are in the process of being finalized by regulators outside the U.S. and certain of our subsidiaries may be subject to such rules.

Although the full impact of global derivatives regulation on us remains unclear, we have already faced, and are expected to continue to face,
increased costs and regulatory oversight due to the registration and regulatory requirements indicated above. Complying with the Swaps rules also has required, and is expected to in the future require, us to change our Swaps businesses and has
required, and may in the future require, extensive systems and personnel changes. Compliance with Swaps-related regulatory capital requirements may require us to devote more capital to our Swaps business.


December 2016 Form 10-K


Non-U.S.

Regulation.

Our
Institutional Securities businesses also are regulated extensively by

non-U.S.

regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, commodity exchanges, self-regulatory organizations, central banks and
regulatory bodies, especially in those jurisdictions in which we maintain an office. In addition, certain Morgan Stanley subsidiaries are regulated as broker-dealers under the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Subsidiaries engaged in
banking and trust activities outside the U.S. are regulated by various government agencies in the particular jurisdiction where they are chartered, incorporated and/or conduct their business activity. For instance, the Prudential Regulation
Authority (“PRA”), the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) and several securities and futures exchanges in the U.K., including the London Stock Exchange and ICE Futures Europe, regulate our activities in the U.K.; the
Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority) and the Deutsche Börse AG regulate our activities in the Federal Republic of Germany; the Financial Services Agency, the Bank of Japan, the
Japanese Securities Dealers Association and several Japanese securities and futures exchanges, regulate our activities in Japan; the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Exchanges and
Clearing Limited regulate our operations in Hong Kong; and the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Singapore Exchange Limited regulate our business in Singapore.

Our largest

non-U.S.

entity, MSIP, is subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the PRA,
which has broad legal authority to establish prudential and other standards applicable to MSIP that seek to ensure its safety and soundness and to minimize adverse effects on the stability of the U.K. financial system. MSIP is also regulated and
supervised by the FCA with respect to business conduct matters.

Non-U.S.

policymakers and
regulators, including the European Commission and European Supervisory Authorities (among others, the European Banking Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority), continue to propose and adopt numerous reforms, including those that
may further impact the structure of banks, and to formulate regulatory standards and measures that will be of relevance and importance to our European operations. In November 2016, the European Commission published proposals that would require
certain large,

non-E.U.

financial groups with two or more institutions established in the E.U., to establish a single E.U. intermediate holding company (“IHC”). The proposals would require E.U. banks
and broker-dealers to be held below the E.U. IHC; until more specific regulations are proposed, it remains unclear which other E.U. entities would need to be held beneath the E.U. IHC. The E.U. IHC would be subject to: direct supervision and
authorization by the European Central Bank or the relevant national E.U.
regu-

lator; the E.U. bank recovery and resolution regime under the E.U. Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (“BRRD”); and capital, liquidity, leverage and other prudential standards on a
consolidated basis. The proposals will now be considered by the European Parliament and the Council of the E.U. The final form of the proposals, as well as the date of their adoption, is not yet certain.

Regulators in the U.K., E.U. and other major jurisdictions have also finalized or are in the process of proposing or finalizing risk-based
capital, leverage capital, liquidity, market-based reforms and other regulatory standards applicable to certain of our subsidiaries that operate in those jurisdictions. For instance, European Market Infrastructure Regulation introduces new
requirements regarding the central clearing and reporting of derivatives, as well as margin requirements for uncleared derivatives. The Markets in Financial Instrument Regulation and a revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive
(together, “MiFID II”), which is now scheduled to take effect on January 3, 2018, will also introduce comprehensive and new trading and market infrastructure reforms in the E.U., including new trading venues, enhancements to

pre-

and post-trading transparency, and additional investor protection requirements, among others. Although the full impact of these changes remains unclear, complying with MiFID II is expected to require extensive
changes to our operations, including systems and controls.

Regulators in the U.K., E.U. and other major jurisdictions have also finalized
or are in the process of proposing or finalizing recovery and resolution planning frameworks and related regulatory requirements that will apply to certain of our subsidiaries that operate in those jurisdictions. For instance, the BRRD has
established a recovery and resolution framework for E.U. credit institutions and investment firms, including MSIP. E.U. Member States were required to apply provisions implementing the BRRD as of January 1, 2015, subject to certain exemptions.
In addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and other E.U. jurisdictions, have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, changes to resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing
entity organized in such jurisdiction by writing down certain unsecured liabilities or converting certain unsecured liabilities into equity.

Investment Management

Many of
the subsidiaries engaged in our asset management activities are registered as investment advisers with the SEC. Many aspects of our asset management activities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations primarily intended to benefit the
investor or client. These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict us

December 2016 Form 10-K



from carrying on our asset management activities in the event that we fail to comply with such laws and regulations. Sanctions that may be imposed for such failure include the suspension of
individual employees, limitations on our engaging in various asset management activities for specified periods of time or specified types of clients, the revocation of registrations, other censures and significant fines. In order to facilitate our
asset management business, we own a registered U.S. broker-dealer, Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc., which acts as distributor to the Morgan Stanley mutual funds and as placement agent to certain private investment funds managed by our Investment
Management business segment. In addition, certain of our affiliates are registered as commodity trading advisors and/or commodity pool operators, or are operating under certain exemptions from such registration pursuant to CFTC rules and other
guidance, and have certain responsibilities with respect to each pool they advise. Violations of the rules of the CFTC, the NFA or the commodity exchanges could result in remedial actions, including fines, registration restrictions or terminations,
trading prohibitions or revocations of commodity exchange memberships. See also “—Institutional Securities and Wealth Management—Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation,” “—Institutional Securities and Wealth
Management—Regulation of Futures Activities and Certain Commodities Activities,” “—Institutional Securities and Wealth Management—Derivatives Regulation” and “—Institutional Securities and Wealth

Management—Non-U.S.

Regulation” above for a discussion of other regulations that impact our Investment Management business, including, among other things, the Department of Labor’s conflict of
interest rule and MiFID II.

As a result of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, our asset management activities are subject to certain
additional laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, additional reporting and recordkeeping requirements (including with respect to clients that are private funds) and restrictions on sponsoring or investing in, or maintaining certain
other relationships with, “covered funds,” as defined in the Volcker Rule, subject to certain limited exemptions. Many of these requirements may increase the expenses associated with our asset management activities and/or reduce the
investment returns we are able to generate for our asset management clients. See also “—Financial Holding Company—Activities Restrictions under the Volcker Rule” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Developments.”

Our Investment Management
business is also regulated outside the U.S. For example, the FCA is the primary regulator of our business in the U.K.; the Financial Services Agency regulates our business in Japan; the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong regulates our
business in

Hong Kong; and the Monetary Authority of Singapore regulates our business in Singapore. See also “—Institutional Securities and Wealth

Management—Non-U.S.

Regulation” herein.

Financial Crimes Program

Our Financial Crimes program is coordinated on an enterprise-wide basis and supports our financial crime prevention efforts across all regions
and business units with responsibility for governance, oversight and execution of our Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”), economic sanctions (“Sanctions”) and anti-corruption programs.

In the U.S., the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, imposes significant obligations on financial institutions to
detect and deter money laundering and terrorist financing activity, including requiring banks, bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers and mutual funds to implement AML
programs, verify the identity of customers that maintain accounts, and monitor and report suspicious activity to appropriate law enforcement or regulatory authorities. Outside the U.S., applicable laws, rules and regulations similarly require
designated types of financial institutions to implement AML programs. We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with all applicable AML laws and regulations. Regarding Sanctions, we have implemented
policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), which target foreign countries,
entities and individuals based on external threats to U.S. foreign policy, national security or economic interests, and to comply, as applicable, similar sanctions programs imposed by foreign governments or global or regional multilateral
organizations such as the United Nations Security Council and the E.U. Council.

We are also subject to applicable anti-corruption laws,
such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly
or indirectly, to a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that
are designed to comply with such laws, rules and regulations.


December 2016 Form 10-K


Protection of Client Information

Many aspects of our businesses are subject to legal requirements concerning the use and protection of certain customer information, including
those adopted pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 in the U.S., the E.U. Data Protection Directive and various laws in Asia, including the Japanese Personal Information (Protection) Law,
the Hong Kong Personal Data (Protection) Ordinance and the Australian Privacy Act. We have adopted measures designed to comply with these and related applicable requirements in all relevant jurisdictions.

Compensation Practices and Other Regulation

Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve and, with respect to some of our subsidiaries and employees, by
other financial regulatory bodies worldwide. In particular, we are subject to the Federal Reserve’s guidance that is designed to help ensure that incentive compensation paid by banking organizations does not encourage imprudent risk taking that
threatens the organizations’ safety and soundness. The scope and content of the Federal Reserve’s policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and may change based on findings from its peer review process, and we expect
that these policies will evolve over a number of years.

We are subject to the compensation-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act,
which may impact our compensation practices. In 2016, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, certain federal regulatory agencies reproposed a rule, which, if implemented as written, would require, among other things, the deferral of a percentage of certain
incentive-based compensation for senior executives and certain other employees and, under certain circumstances, “clawback” of incentive-based compensation. In addition, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, in 2015, the SEC proposed rules that
would direct stock exchanges to require listed companies to implement clawback policies to recover incentive-based compensation from current or former executive officers in the event of certain financial restatements and would also require companies
to disclose their clawback policies and their actions under those policies. We continue to evaluate the proposed rules, both of which are subject to further rulemaking procedures.

Our compensation practices may also be impacted by regulations in other jurisdictions. Our compensation practices with respect to certain
employees whose activities have a material impact on the risk profile of our E.U. operations are subject to the Capital Requirements Directive IV (the “CRD IV”) and related E.U. and Member State regulations, including, among others, a cap
on the ratio of variable remuneration to fixed

remuneration and clawback arrangements in relation to variable remuneration paid in the past. In the U.K., the remuneration of certain employees of banks and other firms is governed by the
Remuneration Code of the FCA and by the PRA Rulebook (Remuneration Part), including provisions that implement the CRD IV, as well as additional U.K. requirements.

For a discussion of certain risks relating to our regulatory environment, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results and strategic objectives, see “Forward-Looking
Statements” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and “Return on Equity Target” and “Effects of Inflation and Changes in Interest and Foreign Exchange Rates” under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7.

Market Risk

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities (the price
volatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices), correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio owned by us. For more information on how we monitor and manage
market risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management—Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A.

Our results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by global and economic conditions and other factors,
including changes in asset values.

Our results of operations have been in the past and may, in the future, be materially affected
by market fluctuations due to global financial markets, economic conditions, changes to the global trade policies and other factors, including the level and volatility of equity, fixed income and commodity prices (including oil prices), interest
rates, currency values and other market indices. The results of our Institutional Securities business segment, particularly results relating to our involvement in primary and secondary markets for all types of financial products, are subject to
substantial market fluctuations due to a variety of factors that we cannot control or predict with great certainty. These fluctuations impact results by causing variations in new business flows and in the fair value of securities and other financial
products. Fluctuations also occur due to the level of global market activity, which, among other things, affects the size, number and timing of investment banking client assignments and transactions and the realization of returns from our principal
investments. During periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions, the level of individual investor participation in the global markets, as well as the level of client assets, may also decrease, which would negatively impact the results of
our Wealth Management business segment. In addition, fluctuations in global market activity could impact the flow of investment capital into or from assets under management or supervision and the way customers allocate capital among

money market, equity, fixed income or other investment alternatives, which could negatively impact our Investment Management business segment.

The value of our financial instruments may be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and
disruptions in the credit markets make it extremely difficult to value certain of our financial instruments, particularly during periods of market displacement. Subsequent valuations in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result
in significant changes in the values of these instruments and may adversely impact historical or prospective performance-based fees (also known as incentive fees or carried interest) in respect of certain business. In addition, at the time of any
sales and settlements of these financial instruments, the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a
decline in the value of our financial instruments, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods.

In
addition, financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Under these extreme conditions, hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as
effective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under more normal market conditions. Moreover, under these conditions, market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and
on a large scale. Our risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk to more extreme market moves. However, severe market events have historically been difficult to predict and we could realize significant losses if
extreme market events were to occur.

Holding large and concentrated positions may expose us to losses.

Concentration of risk may reduce revenues or result in losses in our market-making, investing, block trading, underwriting and lending
businesses in the event of unfavorable market movements, or when market conditions are more favorable for our competitors. We commit substantial amounts of capital to these businesses, which often results in our taking large positions in the
securities of, or making large loans to, a particular issuer or issuers in a particular industry, country or region. For further information regarding our country risk exposure, see also “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk—Risk Management—Credit Risk—Country Risk Exposure” in Item 7A.

Credit Risk

Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us. For more
information on how we monitor and manage credit risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management—Credit Risk” in Part II, Item 7A.

We are exposed to the risk that third parties that are indebted to us will not perform their obligations.

We incur significant credit risk exposure through our Institutional Securities business segment. This risk may arise from a variety of
business activities, including but not limited to extending credit to clients through various lending commitments; entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to us; providing short
or long-term funding that is secured by physical or financial collateral whose value may at times be insufficient to fully cover the loan repayment amount; posting margin and/or collateral and other commitments to clearing houses, clearing agencies,
exchanges, banks,

securities firms and other financial counterparties; and investing and trading in securities and loan pools whereby the value of these assets may fluctuate based on realized or expected defaults on the underlying
obligations or loans.

We also incur credit risk in our Wealth Management business segment lending to mainly individual investors,
including, but not limited to, margin and securities-based loans collateralized by securities, residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.

While we believe current valuations and reserves adequately address our perceived levels of risk, adverse economic conditions may negatively
impact our clients and our current credit exposures. In addition, as a clearing member of several central counterparties, we finance our customer positions and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our customers. Although we
regularly review our credit exposures, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.

A default by a large financial institution could adversely affect financial markets.

The commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other
relationships among the institutions. For example, increased centralization of trading activities through particular clearing houses, central agents or exchanges as required by provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may increase our concentration of risk
with respect to these entities. As a

result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This
is sometimes referred to as “systemic risk” and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing houses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks and securities firms, with which we interact on a daily basis, and therefore could
adversely affect us. See also “Systemic Risk Regime” under “Business—Supervision and Regulation—Financial Holding Company” in Part I, Item 1.

Operational Risk

Operational risk
refers to the risk of loss, or of damage to our reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or from external events (

e.g.

, fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical
assets). We may incur operational risk across the full scope of our business activities, including revenue-generating activities (

e.g.

, sales and trading) and support and control groups (

e.g.

, information technology and trade
processing). Legal, regulatory and compliance risk is included in the scope of operational risk and is discussed below under “Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk.” For more information on how we monitor and manage operational risk, see
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management—Operational Risk” in Part II, Item 7A.

We are subject to operational risks, including a failure, breach or other disruption of our operational or security systems, that could
adversely affect our businesses or reputation.

Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and report, on a
daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. In some of our businesses, the transactions we process are complex. In addition, we may introduce new products or services or change processes or
reporting, including in connection with new regulatory requirements, resulting in new operational risk that we may not fully appreciate or identify. The trend toward direct access to automated, electronic markets and the move to more automated
trading platforms has resulted in using increasingly complex technology that relies on the continued effectiveness of the programming code and integrity of the data to process the trades. We perform the functions required to operate our different
businesses either by ourselves or through agreements with third parties. We rely on the ability of our employees, our internal systems and systems at technology centers operated by unaffiliated third parties to process a high volume of transactions.
Additionally, we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing privacy and data protection, which may differ, and potentially conflict, in various jurisdictions.


December 2016 Form 10-K


As a major participant in the global capital markets, we maintain extensive controls to reduce
the risk of incorrect valuation or risk management of our trading positions due to flaws in data, models, electronic trading systems or processes or due to fraud. Nevertheless, such risk cannot be completely eliminated.

We also face the risk of operational failure or termination of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial
intermediaries we use to facilitate our lending. securities and derivatives transactions. In the event of a breakdown or improper operation of our or a third party’s systems or improper or unauthorized action by third parties or our employees,
we could suffer financial loss, an impairment to our liquidity, a disruption of our businesses, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation. In addition, the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges
and clearing houses, and the increased importance of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct
business.

Despite the business contingency plans we have in place, there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all
potential business continuity risks to us. Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located, which are concentrated in the New York
metropolitan area, London, Hong Kong and Tokyo as well as Mumbai, Budapest, Glasgow and Baltimore. This may include a disruption involving physical site access, cyber incidents, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, catastrophic events, natural
disasters, extreme weather events, electrical outage, environmental hazard, computer servers, communications or other services we use, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business.

Although we devote significant resources to maintaining and upgrading our systems and networks with measures such as intrusion prevention and
detection systems, monitoring firewalls and network traffic to safeguard critical business applications, and supervising third party providers that have access to our systems, there is no guarantee that these measures or any other measures can
provide absolute security given the techniques used in cyber attacks are complex and frequently change, and may not be able to be anticipated. Like other financial services firms, the Firm and its third party providers continue to be the subject of
attempted unauthorized access, mishandling or misuse of information, computer viruses or malware, cyber attacks designed to obtain confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage

systems or cause other damage, denial of service attacks and other events. These threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties, including
third party providers, or may result from accidental technological failure. Additional challenges are posed by external extremist parties, including foreign state actors, in some circumstances as a means to promote political ends. Any of these
parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, clients, third parties or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. There can be no
assurance that such unauthorized access or cyber incidents will not occur in the future, and they could occur more frequently and on a more significant scale.

If one or more of these events occur, it could result in a security impact on our systems and jeopardize our or our clients’,
partners’ or counterparties’ personal, confidential, proprietary or other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our and our third party providers’ computer systems. Furthermore, such events could cause
interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients’, partners’, counterparties’ or third parties’ operations, which could result in reputational damage with our clients and the market, client dissatisfaction, additional costs to
us (such as repairing systems or adding new personnel or protection technologies), regulatory investigations, litigation or enforcement, or regulatory fines or penalties, all or any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition
or results of operations.

Given our global footprint and the high volume of transactions we process, the large number of clients,
partners and counterparties with which we do business, and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection. We expect that any investigation of a cyber attack
would be inherently unpredictable and that it would take time before the completion of any investigation and before there is availability of full and reliable information. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how
best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.

While many of our agreements with partners and third party vendors include indemnification provisions, we may not be able to recover
sufficiently, or at all, under such provisions to adequately offset any losses. In addition, although we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may
be insufficient to cover all losses.

Liquidity and Funding Risk

Liquidity and funding risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets
or difficulty in liquidating our assets. Liquidity and funding risk encompasses the risk that our financial condition or overall soundness is adversely affected by an inability or perceived inability to meet our financial obligations in a timely
manner. It also includes the associated funding risks triggered by the market or idiosyncratic stress events that may cause unexpected changes in funding needs or an inability to raise new funding. For more information on how we monitor and manage
liquidity and funding risk, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7 and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk—Risk Management—Liquidity and Funding Risk” in Part II, Item 7A.

Liquidity is essential to
our businesses and we rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our operations.

Liquidity is essential to our
businesses. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by our inability to raise funding in the long-term or short-term debt capital markets or our inability to access the secured lending markets. Factors that we cannot control, such as disruption
of the financial markets or negative views about the financial services industry generally, including concerns regarding fiscal matters in the U.S. and other geographic areas, could impair our ability to raise funding.

In addition, our ability to raise funding could be impaired if investors or lenders develop a negative perception of our long-term or
short-term financial prospects due to factors such as an incurrence of large trading losses, a downgrade by the rating agencies, a decline in the level of our business activity, or if regulatory authorities take significant action against us or our
industry, or we discover significant employee misconduct or illegal activity. If we are unable to raise funding using the methods described above, we would likely need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets, such as our investment portfolios or
trading assets, to meet maturing liabilities. We may be unable to sell some of our assets or we may have to sell assets at a discount to market value, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition.

Our borrowing costs and access to the debt capital markets depend on our credit ratings.

The cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are impacted by our short-term and long-term credit ratings. The

rating agencies continue to monitor certain issuer specific factors that are important to the determination of our credit ratings, including governance, the level and quality of earnings, capital
adequacy, liquidity and funding, risk appetite and management, asset quality, strategic direction, and business mix. Additionally, the rating agencies will look at other industry-wide factors such as regulatory or legislative changes, including, for
example, regulatory changes, macro-economic environment, and perceived levels of third party support, and it is possible that they could downgrade our ratings and those of similar institutions.

Our credit ratings also can have a significant impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer term
counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as OTC and other derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. In connection with certain OTC trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with our
Institutional Securities business segment, we may be required to provide additional collateral to, or immediately settle any outstanding liability balance with, certain counterparties in the event of a credit ratings downgrade. Termination of our
trading and other agreements could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements. The additional collateral or termination payments
which may occur in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and can be based on ratings by either or both of Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. and S&P Global Ratings. See also “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Ratings—Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments upon Potential Future Rating Downgrade” in Part II, Item 7.

We are a holding company and depend on payments from our subsidiaries.

The Parent Company has no operations and depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend
payments and to fund all payments on its obligations, including debt obligations. Regulatory, tax restrictions or elections and other legal restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. In
particular, many of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws, regulations and self-regulatory organization rules that limit, as well as authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce, the flow of funds to the
Parent Company, or that prohibit such transfers or dividends altogether in certain circumstances, including steps to “ring fence” entities by regulators outside of the U.S. to protect clients and creditors of such entities in the event of


December 2016 Form 10-K


financial difficulties involving such entities. These laws, regulations and rules may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to make payments on our obligations. Furthermore, as a
bank holding company, we may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock.

The OCC, the Federal Reserve and the
FDIC have the authority, and under certain circumstances the duty, to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Firm and its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries.

Our liquidity and financial condition have in the past been, and in the future could be, adversely affected by U.S. and international
markets and economic conditions.

Our ability to raise funding in the long-term or short-term debt capital markets or the equity
markets, or to access secured lending markets, has in the past been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by conditions in the U.S. and international markets and economies. Global market and economic conditions have been particularly
disrupted and volatile in the last several years and may be in the future. In particular, our cost and availability of funding in the past have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads.
Significant turbulence in the U.S., the E.U. and other international markets and economies could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with us.

Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk

Legal, regulatory and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss including fines, penalties,
judgments, damages and/or settlements, or loss to reputation we may suffer as a result of our failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities.
This risk also includes contractual and commercial risk, such as the risk that a counterparty’s performance obligations will be unenforceable. It also includes compliance with AML, anti-corruption and terrorist financing rules and regulations.
For more information on how we monitor and manage legal, regulatory and compliance risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management—Legal and Compliance Risk” in Part II, Item 7A.

The financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation, and changes in regulation will impact our business.

Like other major financial services firms, we are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and securities
exchanges and by regulators and

exchanges in each of the major markets where we conduct our business. These laws and regulations significantly affect the way we do business and can restrict the scope of our existing businesses
and limit our ability to expand our product offerings and pursue certain investments.

The regulation of major financial firms, including
the Firm, as well as of the markets in which we operate, is extensive and subject to ongoing change. We are, or will become, subject to (among other things) wide-ranging regulation and supervision, intensive scrutiny of our businesses and any plans
for expansion of those businesses, limitations on new activities, a systemic risk regime that imposes heightened capital and liquidity requirements and other enhanced prudential standards, resolution regimes and resolution planning requirements, new
requirements for maintaining minimum amounts of external total loss-absorbing capacity and external long-term debt, restrictions on activities and investments imposed by the Volcker Rule, comprehensive derivatives regulation, tax regulations,
antitrust laws, trade and transaction reporting obligations, and broadened fiduciary obligations. In some areas, regulatory standards have not yet been finalized, are subject to final rulemaking or transition periods or may otherwise be revised in
whole or in part. Ongoing implementation of, or changes in, laws and regulations could materially impact the profitability of our businesses and the value of assets we hold, expose us to additional costs, require changes to business practices or
force us to discontinue businesses, adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our stock, or require us to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely impact our shareholders or creditors. In addition, regulatory
requirements that are being imposed by foreign policymakers and regulators may be inconsistent or conflict with regulations that we are subject to in the U.S. and may adversely affect us. We expect legal and regulatory requirements to be subject to
ongoing change for the foreseeable future, which may result in significant new costs to comply with new or revised requirements as well as to monitor for compliance on an ongoing basis.

The application of regulatory requirements and strategies in the United States or other jurisdictions to facilitate the orderly
resolution of large financial institutions may pose a greater risk of loss for our security holders, and subject us to other restrictions.

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC an annual resolution plan that describes our
strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress or failure. If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were to jointly determine that our annual resolution plan submission was not
credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution, and if we were unable to address any
defi-

December 2016 Form 10-K



ciencies identified by the regulators, we or any of our subsidiaries may be subject to more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities, or
operations, or after a two year period, we may be required to divest assets or operations.

In addition, provided that certain procedures
are met, we can be subject to a resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act with the FDIC being appointed as receiver. The FDIC’s power under the orderly liquidation authority to disregard
the priority of creditor claims and treat similarly situated creditors differently in certain circumstances, subject to certain limitations, could adversely impact holders of our unsecured debt. See “Business—Supervision and
Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements” in Part II, Item 7.

Further, because both our resolution plan contemplates a an SPOE strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the FDIC has proposed an SPOE
strategy through which it may apply its orderly liquidation authority powers, we believe that the application of an SPOE strategy is the reasonably likely outcome if either our resolution plan were implemented or a resolution proceeding were
commenced under the orderly liquidation authority. An SPOE strategy generally contemplates the provision of additional capital and liquidity by the Parent Company to certain of its subsidiaries so that such subsidiaries have the resources necessary
to implement the resolution strategy, and the Parent Company expects to enter

into an amended and restated secured support agreement with its material subsidiaries pursuant to which it would
provide such capital and liquidity.

Under the amended and restated support agreement, upon the occurrence of a resolution scenario,
including one in which an SPOE strategy is used, the Parent Company will be obligated to contribute or loan on a subordinated basis all of its material assets, other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company and certain intercompany
payables, to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to its material subsidiaries. The obligations of the Parent Company under the amended and restated support agreement will be secured on a senior basis by the assets of the Parent Company
(other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company). As a result, claims of our material subsidiaries against the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company) will be effectively senior to unsecured
obligations of the Parent Company. Such unsecured obligations would be at risk of absorbing losses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. Although an SPOE strategy, whether applied pursuant to our resolution plan or in a resolution

proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority, is intended to result in better outcomes for creditors overall, there is no guarantee that the application of an SPOE strategy, including the
provision of support to the Parent Company’s material subsidiaries pursuant to the amended and restated secured support agreement, will not result in greater losses for holders of our securities compared to a different resolution strategy for
the firm.

Regulators have taken and proposed various actions to facilitate an SPOE strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the orderly
liquidation authority or other resolution regimes. For example, the Federal Reserve has issued a final rule that requires

top-tier

bank holding companies of U.S.

G-SIBs,

including Morgan Stanley, to maintain minimum amounts of equity and eligible long-term debt (“total loss-absorbing capacity” or “TLAC”) in order to ensure that such institutions have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point
of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of debt to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible TLAC where the SPOE strategy is used. The combined implication of the SPOE resolution strategy and the TLAC final rule is that our
losses will be imposed on the holders of eligible long-term debt and other forms of eligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are imposed on the holders of the debt securities of our operating subsidiaries or before putting U.S.
taxpayers at risk.

In addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and other E.U. jurisdictions, have implemented, or are in the
process of implementing, changes to resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing entity organized in such jurisdiction by writing down certain unsecured liabilities or converting certain unsecured
liabilities into equity. Such

“bail-in”

powers are intended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured creditors.

Non-U.S.

regulators are also considering requirements that certain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of total loss-absorbing capacity that would pass losses up from the
subsidiaries to the Parent Company and, ultimately, to security holders of the Parent Company in the event of failure.

We may be
prevented from paying dividends or taking other capital actions because of regulatory constraints or revised regulatory capital standards.

We are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve, which requires us to submit, on
an annual basis, a capital plan describing proposed dividend payments to shareholders,


December 2016 Form 10-K


proposed repurchases of our outstanding securities, and other proposed capital actions that we intend to take. The Federal Reserve may object to, or otherwise require us to modify, such plan, or
may object or require modifications to a resubmitted capital plan, any of which would adversely affect shareholders. In addition, beyond review of the plan, the Federal Reserve may impose other restrictions or conditions on us that prevent us from
paying or increasing dividends, repurchasing securities or taking other capital actions that would benefit shareholders. Finally, the Federal Reserve may change regulatory capital standards to impose higher requirements that restrict our ability to
take capital actions, or may modify or impose other regulatory standards that increase our operating expenses and reduce our ability to take capital actions.

The financial services industry faces substantial litigation and is subject to extensive regulatory and law enforcement investigations,
and we may face damage to our reputation and legal liability.

As a global financial services firm, we face the risk of
investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory organizations in all countries in which we conduct our business. Investigations and proceedings initiated by these authorities may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines,
penalties, injunctions or other relief. In addition to the monetary consequences, these measures could, for example, impact our ability to engage in, or impose limitations on, certain of our businesses. The number of these investigations and
proceedings, as well as the amount of penalties and fines sought, has increased substantially in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry, including the Firm, and certain U.S. and international governmental entities
have increasingly brought criminal actions against, or have sought criminal convictions, pleas or deferred prosecution agreements from, financial institutions. Significant regulatory or law enforcement action against us could materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause us significant reputational harm, which could seriously harm our business. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides compensation to whistleblowers who present the SEC or CFTC with
information related to securities or commodities law violations that leads to a successful enforcement action. As a result of this compensation, it is possible we could face an increased number of investigations by the SEC or CFTC.

We have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation,
as well as investigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies, arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal or regulatory

actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages, claims for indeterminate amounts of damages, or may result in penalties, fines, or other results adverse to us. In
some cases, the issuers that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress. In other cases, including antitrust litigation, we may be subject to claims for joint and several liability with other
defendants for treble damages or other relief related to alleged conspiracies involving other institutions. Like any large corporation, we are also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, including

non-compliance

with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information, or improper sales practices or conduct.

We may be responsible for representations and warranties associated with residential and commercial real estate loans and may incur
losses in excess of our reserves.

We originate loans secured by commercial and residential properties. Further, we securitize and
trade in a wide range of commercial and residential real estate and real estate-related whole loans, mortgages and other real estate and commercial assets and products, including residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. In connection
with these activities, we have provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, certain representations and warranties. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if
such representations and warranties were breached. We have also made representations and warranties in connection with our role as an originator of certain commercial mortgage loans that we securitized in commercial mortgage-backed securities. For
additional information, see also Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8.

We currently have several
legal proceedings related to claims for alleged breaches of representations and warranties. If there are decisions adverse to us in those legal proceedings, we may incur losses substantially in excess of our reserves. In addition, our reserves are
based, in part, on certain factual and legal assumptions. If those assumptions are incorrect and need to be revised, we may need to adjust our reserves substantially.

Our commodities activities and investments subject us to extensive regulation, and environmental risks and regulation that may expose us
to significant costs and liabilities.

In connection with the commodities activities in our Institutional Securities business
segment, we engage in the storage, transportation, marketing and execution of transactions in several commodities, including metals, natural gas, electric power, emission credits, and other commodity products. In

December 2016 Form 10-K



addition, we are an electricity power marketer in the U.S. and own a minority interest in Heidmar Holdings LLC

, which owns a group of
companies that provide international marine transportation and U.S. marine logistics services. As a result of these activities, we are subject to extensive energy, commodities, environmental, health and safety and other governmental laws and
regulations. Further, through these activities we are exposed to regulatory, physical and certain indirect risks associated with climate change.

Although we have attempted to mitigate our environmental risks by, among other measures, selling or ceasing most of our prior petroleum
storage and transportation activities, adopting appropriate policies and procedures, and implementing emergency response programs, these actions may not prove adequate to address every contingency. In addition, insurance covering some of these risks
may not be available, and the proceeds, if any, from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particular incidents. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely
affected by these events.

During the past several years, intensified scrutiny of certain energy markets by federal, state and local
authorities in the U.S. and abroad and the public has resulted in increased regulatory and legal enforcement, litigation and remedial proceedings involving companies conducting the activities in which we are engaged. In addition, new regulation of
OTC derivatives markets in the U.S. and similar legislation proposed or adopted abroad will impose significant new costs and impose new requirements on our commodities derivatives activities. We may incur substantial costs or loss of revenue in
complying with current or future laws and regulations and our overall businesses and reputation may be adversely affected by the current legal environment. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial
civil and criminal fines and penalties. See also “Financial Holding Company—Capital Standards—Commodities-Related Capital Requirements” under “Business—Supervision and Regulation” in Part I, Item 1.

A failure to address conflicts of interest appropriately could adversely affect our businesses and reputation.

As a global financial services firm that provides products and services to a large and diversified group of clients, including corporations,
governments, financial institutions and individuals, we face potential conflicts of interest in the normal course of business. For example, potential conflicts can occur when there is a divergence of interests between us and a client, among clients,
between an employee on the one hand

and us or a client on the other, or situations in which we may be a creditor of a client. We have policies, procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address potential conflicts
of interest. However, identifying and mitigating potential conflicts of interest can be complex and challenging, and can become the focus of media and regulatory scrutiny. Indeed, actions that merely appear to create a conflict can put our
reputation at risk even if the likelihood of an actual conflict has been mitigated. It is possible that potential conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions, which may lead to our clients being less willing to enter into
transactions in which a conflict may occur and could adversely affect our businesses and reputation.

Our regulators have the ability to
scrutinize our activities for potential conflicts of interest, including through detailed examinations of specific transactions. For example, our status as a bank holding company supervised by the Federal Reserve subjects us to direct Federal
Reserve scrutiny with respect to transactions between our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries and their affiliates. Further, the Volcker Rule subjects us to regulatory scrutiny regarding certain transactions between us and our clients.

Risk Management

Our risk
management strategies, models and processes may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk.

We have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management capabilities and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless,
our risk management strategies, models and processes, including our use of various risk models for assessing market exposures and hedging strategies, stress testing and other analysis, may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in
all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated. As our businesses change and grow, and the markets in which we operate evolve, our risk management strategies, models and processes may not
always adapt with those changes. Some of our methods of managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior and management’s judgment. As a result, these methods may not predict future risk exposures, which could be
significantly greater than the historical measures indicate. In addition, many models we use are based on assumptions or inputs regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators and therefore cannot anticipate
sudden, unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements, which could cause us to incur losses.

Management of market, credit, liquidity, operational, legal, regulatory and compliance risks
requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Our trading risk management strategies and techniques also
seek to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany
their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the timing of such outcomes. For example, to the extent that our trading or investing activities involve less liquid trading markets or are otherwise subject to restrictions
on sales or hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions. We may, therefore, incur losses in the course of our trading or investing activities. For more information on how we
monitor and manage market and certain other risks and related strategies, models and processes, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management—Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A.

Competitive Environment

We face
strong competition from other financial services firms, which could lead to pricing pressures that could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability.

The financial services industry and all aspects of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete with
commercial banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, electronic trading and clearing platforms, financial data repositories, sponsors of mutual funds, hedge funds, energy companies and other companies offering financial or ancillary services in
the U.S., globally and through the internet. We compete on the basis of several factors, including transaction execution, capital or access to capital, products and services, innovation, technology, reputation, risk appetite and price. Over time,
certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have left businesses, been acquired by or merged into other firms, or have declared bankruptcy. Such
changes could result in our remaining competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as the ability to offer a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity, or new competitors may emerge. We have experienced and may
continue to experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices. In addition, certain of our competitors may be subject to different, and, in some cases, less
stringent, legal and regulatory regimes, than we are, thereby putting us at a competitive disadvantage. For more
informa-

tion regarding the competitive environment in which we operate, see “Business—Competition” and “Business—Supervision and Regulation” in Part I, Item 1.

Automated trading markets may adversely affect our business and may increase competition.

We have experienced intense price competition in some of our businesses in recent years. In particular, the ability to execute securities,
derivatives and other financial instrument trades electronically on exchanges, swap execution facilities, and other automated trading platforms has increased the pressure on

bid-offer

spreads, commissions,
markups or comparable fees. The trend toward direct access to automated, electronic markets will likely continue and will likely increase as additional markets move to more automated trading platforms. We have experienced and it is likely that we
will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors may seek to obtain market share by reducing

bid-offer

spreads, commissions, markups or
comparable fees.

Our ability to retain and attract qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure
to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.

Our people are our most important resource and competition for
qualified employees is intense. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain highly qualified employees, or do so at rates or in forms necessary to maintain our competitive position, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain
employees become more expensive, our performance, including our competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. The financial industry has experienced and may continue to experience more stringent regulation of employee compensation,
including limitations relating to incentive-based compensation, clawback requirements and special taxation, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or retain the most qualified employees.

International Risk

We are subject
to numerous political, economic, legal, tax, operational, franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could adversely impact our businesses in many ways.

We are subject to political, economic, legal, tax, operational, franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries,
including risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, increased taxes and levies, and other restrictive governmental actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and
governmental instability. In many countries, the

December 2016 Form 10-K



laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in
every market. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally. We are also subject to the enhanced
risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases.

Various emerging market countries have experienced
severe political, economic or financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies, defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt, capital and currency exchange controls, high rates of inflation and low or negative growth
rates in their economies. Crime and corruption, as well as issues of security and personal safety, also exist in certain of these countries. These conditions could adversely impact our businesses and increase volatility in financial markets
generally.

The emergence of a disease pandemic or other widespread health emergency, or concerns over the possibility of such an
emergency as well as natural disasters, terrorist activities or military actions, could create economic and financial disruptions in emerging markets and other areas throughout the world, and could lead to operational difficulties (including travel
limitations) that could impair our ability to manage our businesses around the world.

As a U.S. company, we are required to comply with
the economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by OFAC and similar multi-national bodies and governmental agencies worldwide, as well as applicable anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. A violation of a sanction, embargo program, or anti-corruption law could subject us, and individual employees, to a regulatory enforcement action as well as significant civil and criminal penalties.

The U.K.’s anticipated withdrawal from the E.U. could adversely affect us.

On June 23, 2016, the U.K. electorate voted to leave the E.U. It is difficult to predict the future of the U.K.’s relationship with the
E.U., which uncertainty may increase the volatility in the global financial markets in the short- and medium-term. The U.K. Prime Minister has confirmed the U.K. will invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by no later than the end of March 2017,
subject to the passing of necessary legislation by the U.K. Parliament. This will trigger a two-year period, subject to extension, during which the U.K. government is expected to negotiate its withdrawal agreement with the E.U. Absent any changes to
this time schedule, the U.K.

is expected to leave the E.U. in early 2019. The terms and conditions of the anticipated withdrawal from the E.U., and which of the several alternative models of relationship that the U.K. might
seek to negotiate with the E.U., remain uncertain. However, the U.K. government has stated that the U.K. will leave the E.U. single market and will seek a phased period of implementation for the new relationship that may cover the legal and
regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions with significant operations in Europe, such as the Firm. Potential effects of the U.K. exit from the E.U. and potential mitigation actions may vary considerably depending on the timing of
withdrawal and the nature of any transition or successor arrangements. Any future limitations on providing financial services into the E.U. from our U.K. operations could require us to make potentially significant changes to our operations in the
U.K. and Europe and our legal structure there, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.

Acquisition, Divestiture and
Joint Venture Risk

We may be unable to fully capture the expected value from acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures,
minority stakes or strategic alliances.

In connection with past or future acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, minority
stakes or strategic alliances (including with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc.), we face numerous risks and uncertainties combining, transferring, separating or integrating the relevant businesses and systems, including the need to combine or
separate accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with clients, trading counterparties and business partners. In the case of joint ventures and minority stakes, we are subject to additional risks
and uncertainties because we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control.

In addition, conflicts or disagreements between us and any of our joint venture partners may negatively impact the benefits to be achieved by
the relevant joint venture.

There is no assurance that any of our acquisitions or divestitures will be successfully integrated or
disaggregated or yield all of the positive benefits anticipated. If we are not able to integrate or disaggregate successfully our past and future acquisitions or dispositions, there is a risk that our results of operations, financial condition and
cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.

Certain of our business initiatives, including expansions of existing businesses,
may bring us into contact, directly or


December 2016 Form 10-K


indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base and may expose us to new asset classes and new markets. These business activities expose
us to new and enhanced risks, greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities, increased credit-related, sovereign and operational risks, and reputational concerns regarding the manner in which these assets are being operated or held.

For more information regarding the regulatory environment in which we operate, see also “Business—Supervision and Regulation”
in Part I, Item 1.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

We, like other well-known seasoned issuers, from time to time receive written comments from the staff of the SEC regarding our periodic or
current reports under the Exchange Act. There are no comments that remain unresolved that we received not less than 180 days before the end of the year to which this report relates that we believe are material.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

In addition to the matters described below, in the normal course of business, the Firm has been
named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or
threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are
in financial distress.

The Firm is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and
informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the Firm’s business, and involving, among other matters, sales and trading activities, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by the Firm, and accounting
and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.

The Firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. Where available information indicates that it
is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the Firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the Firm accrues the estimated loss by a charge to income. The Firm’s future legal
expenses may fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment regarding government investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the Firm.

In many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible, or to
estimate the amount of any loss. The Firm cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings or investigations will be resolved or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings
and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved,
including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal
questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question, before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation. Subject to the foregoing, the Firm believes,
based on current

knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such proceedings and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Firm,
although the outcome of such proceedings or investigations could be material to the Firm’s operating results and cash flows for a particular period depending on, among other things, the level of the Firm’s revenues or income for such
period.

Over the last several years, the level of litigation and investigatory activity (both formal and informal) by government and
self-regulatory agencies has increased materially in the financial services industry. As a result, the Firm expects that it will continue to be the subject of elevated claims for damages and other relief and, while the Firm has identified below
certain proceedings that the Firm believes to be material, individually or collectively, there can be no assurance that additional material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be
material.

California v. Morgan Stanley, et al.

, on behalf of California investors, including the California Public Employees’ Retirement System and the California Teachers’ Retirement System. The
complaint alleges that the Firm made misrepresentations and omissions regarding residential mortgage-backed securities and notes issued by the Cheyne SIV, and asserts violations of the California False Claims Act and other state laws and seeks
treble damages, civil penalties, disgorgement, and injunctive relief. On September 30, 2016, the court granted the Firm’s demurrer, with leave to replead. On October 21, 2016, the California Attorney General filed

December 2016 Form 10-K



an amended complaint. On January 25, 2017, the court denied the Firm’s demurrer with respect to the amended complaint.

Currency Related Matters

The Firm is
responding to a number of regulatory and governmental inquiries both in the United States and abroad related to its foreign exchange business. In addition, on June 29, 2015, the Firm and a number of other financial institutions were named as
respondents in a proceeding before Brazil’s Council for Economic Defense related to alleged anticompetitive activity in the foreign exchange market for the Brazilian Real.

The Firm, as well as other foreign exchange dealers, are defendants in

In Re Foreign Exchange Benchmark Rates Antitrust Litigation

,
pending in the SDNY. On July 16, 2015, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint generally alleging that defendants engaged in a conspiracy to fix, maintain or make artificial prices for key benchmark rates, to manipulate bid/ask spreads, and, by
their behavior in the

over-the-counter

market, to thereby cause corresponding manipulation in the foreign exchange futures market. Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief as
well as treble damages in an unspecified amount. On December 16, 2016, the Firm and plaintiffs reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigation with respect to the Firm. After it is finalized by the parties, the settlement will be
subject to court approval.

European Matters

On June 26, 2006, the public prosecutor in Parma, Italy brought criminal charges against certain present and former employees of the Firm
related to the bankruptcy of Parmalat in 2003. The trial commenced in September 2009 and the evidence phase concluded in January 2017. A verdict is expected during the course of 2017. While the Firm is not a defendant in the criminal proceeding,
certain investors have asserted civil claims against the Firm related to the proceedings. These claims seek, among other relief, moral damages and loss of opportunity damages related to their purchase of approximately €327 million in bonds
issued by Parmalat. In addition, on October 11, 2011, an Italian financial institution, Banco Popolare Societá Cooperativa (“Banco Popolare”), filed a civil claim against the Firm in the Milan courts, styled

Banco Popolare
Societá Cooperativa v Morgan Stanley

& Co. International plc

& others

(File number 63671/2011), related to its purchase of €100 million of bonds issued by Parmalat. The claim
asserted by Banco Popolare alleges, among other things, that the Firm was aware of Parmalat’s impending insolvency and conspired with others to deceive Banco Popolare into buying bonds by concealing both Parmalat’s true financial condition
and certain features

of the bonds from the market and Banco Popolare. Banco Popolare seeks damages of €76 million (approximately $80 million) plus damages for loss of opportunity and moral damages. The Firm
filed its answer on April 20, 2012, and the hearing on the parties’ final submissions is scheduled for March 20, 2018.

On
May 12, 2016, the Austrian state of Land Salzburg filed a claim against the Firm in the Regional Court in Frankfurt, Germany, styled

Land Salzburg v. Morgan Stanley

& Co. International plc

(the “German
Proceedings”) seeking €209 million (approximately $220 million) plus interest, attorneys’ fees and other relief relating to certain fixed income and commodities derivative transactions which Land Salzburg entered into with the
Firm between 2005 and 2012. Land Salzburg has alleged that it had neither the capacity nor authority to enter into such transactions, which should be set aside, and that the Firm breached certain advisory and other duties which the Firm had owed to
it. On April 28, 2016, the Firm filed an action against Land Salzburg in the High Court in London, England styled

Morgan Stanley Capital Services LLC and Morgan Stanley

& Co. International plc v. Land Salzburg

(the
“English Proceedings”) in which the Firm is seeking declarations that Land Salzburg had both the capacity and authority to enter into the transactions, and that the Firm has no liability to Land Salzburg arising from them. On July 25,
2016, the Firm filed an application with the Regional Court in Frankfurt to stay the German Proceedings on the basis that the High Court in London was first seized of the dispute between the parties and, pending determination of that application,
filed its statement of defense on December 23, 2016. On December 8, 2016, Land Salzburg filed an application with the High Court in London challenging its jurisdiction to determine the English Proceedings.

On July 11, 2016, the Firm received an invitation to respond to a proposed claim (“Proposed Claim”) by the public prosecutor
for Court of Accounts for the Republic of Italy. The Proposed Claim relates to certain derivative transactions between the Republic of Italy and the Firm. The transactions were originally entered into between 1999 and 2005, and were terminated in
December 2011 and January 2012. The Proposed Claim alleges, inter alia, that the Firm was acting as an agent of the Republic of Italy, that some or all of the derivative transactions were improper and that the termination of the transactions was
also improper. The Proposed Claim indicates that, if a proceeding is initiated against the Firm, the public prosecutor would be asserting administrative claims against the Firm for €2.879 billion (approximately $3 billion). The Firm
does not agree with the Proposed Claim and presented its defenses to the public prosecutor.

Other Litigation

On October 20, 2014, a purported class action complaint was filed against the Firm and other defendants styled

Genesee

County
Employees’ Retirement System v. Bank of America Corporation et al.

in the SDNY. The action was later consolidated with four similar actions in SDNY under the lead case styled

Alaska Electrical Pension Fund v. Bank of America Corporation
et al.

A consolidated amended complaint was filed on February 2, 2015 asserting claims for alleged violations of the Sherman Act, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, and
tortious interference with contract. The consolidated amended complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants engaged in antitrust violations with regards to the process of setting ISDAfix, a financial benchmark and seeks treble damages,
injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees and other relief. On March 28, 2016, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. On February 7, 2017, the plaintiffs filed a
second consolidated amended complaint.

The following matters were terminated during or following the quarter ended December 31,
2016:

On December 23, 2009, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle filed a complaint against the Firm and another defendant in
the Superior Court of the State of Washington, styled

Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle v. Morgan Stanley

& Co. Inc., et al.

The amended complaint, filed on September 28, 2010, alleges that defendants made untrue
statements and material omissions in the sale to plaintiff of certain mortgage pass-through certificates backed by securitization trusts containing residential mortgage loans. The total amount of certificates allegedly sold to plaintiff by the Firm
was approximately $233 million. The complaint raises claims under the Washington State Securities Act and seeks, among other

things, to rescind the plaintiff’s purchase of such certificates. On January 23, 2017, the parties reached an agreement to settle the litigation.

On March 15, 2010, the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco filed a complaint against the Firm and other defendants in the Superior
Court of the State of California styled

Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco v. Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. et al.

An amended complaint, filed on June 10, 2010, alleges that defendants made untrue statements and material omissions
in connection with the sale to plaintiff of certain mortgage pass-through certificates backed by securitization trusts containing residential mortgage loans. The amount of certificates allegedly sold to plaintiff by the Firm was approximately
$276 million. The complaint raises claims under both the federal securities laws and California law and seeks, among other things, to rescind the plaintiff’s purchase of such certificates. On December 21, 2016, the parties reached an
agreement to settle the litigation.

On January 25, 2011, the Firm was named as a defendant in

The Bank of New York Mellon Trust,
National Association v. Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital, Inc.,

a litigation pending in the SDNY. The suit, brought by the trustee of a series of commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, alleges that the Firm breached certain
representations and warranties with respect to an $81 million commercial mortgage loan that was originated and transferred to the trust by the Firm in 2007. The complaint seeks, among other things, to have the Firm repurchase the loan and pay
additional monetary damages, and interest. On February 17, 2017, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigation.

Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of our outstanding stock under a share repurchase program (the

non-objection

from the Federal Reserve to
our 2016 capital plan, which included a share repurchase of up to $3.5 billion of our outstanding common stock during the period beginning July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017. During the quarter ended December 31, 2016, we
repurchased approximately $1.0 billion of our outstanding common stock as part of our Share Repurchase Program. For further information, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Management” in Part II, Item 7.

Consolidated Results: 2016 Compared with 2015

•

We reported net revenues of $34,631 million in 2016, compared with $35,155 million in 2015. For
2016, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $5,979 million, or $2.92 per diluted common share, compared with $6,127 million, or $2.90 per diluted common share, in 2015.

•

Results for 2016 included net discrete tax benefits of $68 million or $0.04 per diluted common share,
primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters. Results for 2015 included net
discrete tax benefits of $564 million or $0.29 per diluted common share, primarily associated with the repatriation of

non-U.S.

earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated, and positive revenues
due to the impact of debt valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $618 million or $0.20 per diluted common share. For a further discussion of the net discrete tax

that requires unrealized gains and losses from debt-related credit spreads and other credit factors (i.e., DVA) to be presented in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”) as
opposed to Trading revenues. Results for 2015 and 2014 are not restated pursuant to that guidance.

•

Net revenues were $34,631 million and net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $5,979 million, or $2.92 per
diluted common share, in 2016 compared with net revenues of $34,537 million and net income applicable to Morgan Stanley of $5,728 million, or $2.70 per diluted common share, excluding DVA in 2015. Excluding the net discrete tax benefits, net income
applicable to Morgan Stanley was $5,911 million, or $2.88 per diluted common share, in 2016 compared with net income applicable to Morgan Stanley of $5,164 million, or $2.41 per diluted common share, excluding both DVA and the net discrete tax
benefits in 2015. (see “Selected Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“Non-GAAP”) Financial Information” herein).

Consolidated Results: 2015 Compared with 2014

•

We reported net revenues of $35,155 million in 2015, compared with $34,275 million in 2014. In 2015,
net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $6,127 million, or $2.90 per diluted common share, compared with $3,467 million, or $1.60 per diluted common share in 2014.

•

Results for 2015 included net discrete tax benefits of $564 million, or $0.29 per diluted common share,
primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated, and positive revenues due to the impact of DVA of $618 million, or $0.20 per diluted common share. Results for 2014 included net discrete tax
benefits of $2,226 million, or $1.13 per diluted common share, due to the release of a deferred tax liability associated with a legal entity restructuring, remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of
a multi-year tax examination, and the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated. For a further discussion of these net discrete tax benefits, see “Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures—Income
Tax Matters” herein. Results for 2014 also included positive revenues associated with DVA of $651 million, or $0.21 per diluted common share. Results for 2014 also included litigation costs related to residential mortgage-backed securities and
credit crisis matters of $3,083 million, or a loss of $1.47 per diluted common share, 2014 compensation actions of
approxi-

mately $1,137 million (see also “Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures—Discretionary Incentive Compensation” herein), or a loss of $0.39 per diluted common share, and
a funding valuation adjustment (“FVA”) implementation charge of $468 million, or a loss of $0.17 per diluted common share.

Business Segment Net Revenues: 2016 Compared with 2015

•

Institutional Securities net revenues of $17,459 million in 2016 decreased 3% compared with
$17,953 million in 2015, primarily as a result of lower Investment banking and sales and trading revenues, partially offset by higher Other revenues.

•

Wealth Management net revenues of $15,350 million in 2016 increased 2% from $15,100 million in 2015,
primarily as a result of growth in Net interest income, partially offset by lower Commissions and fees and Investment banking revenues.

•

Investment Management net revenues of $2,112 million in 2016 decreased 9% from $2,315 million in
2015, primarily reflecting weaker investment performance compared with 2015. This was partially offset by carried interest losses in 2015 associated with Asia private equity that did not

re-occur

in 2016.
Asset management fees in 2016 were relatively unchanged from 2015.

Business Segment Net Revenues: 2015 Compared with 2014

•

Institutional Securities net revenues of $17,953 million in 2015 increased 6% compared with
$16,871 million in 2014, primarily as a result of higher sales and trading net revenues, partially offset by lower Other revenues and lower revenues in Investment banking.

•

Wealth Management net revenues of $15,100 million in 2015 increased 1% from $14,888 million in 2014,
primarily as a result of higher Net interest income and asset management revenues, partially offset by lower transactional revenues.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

•

Investment Management net revenues of $2,315 million in 2015 decreased 15% from $2,712 million in
2014, primarily reflecting the reversal of previously accrued carried interest, reduction in revenues attributable to

non-controlling

interests and markdowns on principal investments.

Consolidated

Non-Interest

Expenses: 2016 Compared with 2015

•

Compensation and benefits expenses of $15,878 million in 2016 decreased 1% from $16,016 million in
2015, primarily due to a decrease in salaries, severance costs, discretionary incentive compensation and employer taxes, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments.

•

Non-compensation

expenses were $9,905 million in 2016 compared
with $10,644 million in 2015, representing a 7% decrease, primarily due to lower litigation costs and expense management.

Consolidated

Non-Interest

Expenses: 2015 Compared with 2014

•

Compensation and benefits expenses of $16,016 million in 2015 decreased 10% from $17,824 million in
2014, primarily as a result of the 2014 compensation actions, and a decrease in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments, related carried interest, and the level of discretionary incentive compensation in 2015 (see also
“Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures—Discretionary Incentive Compensation” herein).

•

Non-compensation

expenses were $10,644 million in 2015 compared
with $12,860 million in 2014, representing a 17% decrease, primarily due to lower litigation costs in the Institutional Securities business segment associated with residential mortgage-backed securities and credit crisis-related matters.

Return on Average Common Equity

•

For 2016, the return on average common equity and the return on average common equity, excluding DVA was 8.0%,
or 7.9% excluding DVA and the net discrete tax benefits. For 2015, the return on average common equity was 8.5%, or 7.8% excluding DVA, and 7.0% excluding DVA and the net discrete tax benefits. For 2014, the return on average common equity was 4.8%,
or 4.1% excluding DVA, and 0.8% excluding DVA and the net discrete tax benefits. See “Selected

Return on average common equity equals consolidated net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as
a percentage of average common equity. Effective January 1, 2016, as a result of the adoption of a provision of the accounting update related to DVA, we have redefined the calculations of the return on average common equity excluding DVA, and
excluding DVA and net discrete tax benefits to adjust for DVA only in the denominator. Prior to January 1, 2016, for the return on average common equity measures, where DVA is excluded, both the numerator and denominator were adjusted to
exclude the impact of DVA. When excluding the net discrete tax benefits, both the numerator and denominator are adjusted to exclude that item in all periods.

3.

The impact of DVA on average common equity and average tangible common equity was approximately $(183) million, $(637)

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Return on Equity Target

We are aiming to improve our return to shareholders and, accordingly, have established a target return on average common equity (“Return
on Equity Target”) of 9% to 11%, excluding DVA to be achieved by 2017, subject to the successful execution of our strategic objectives. We plan to progress toward achieving our Return on Equity Target through the following key elements of our
strategy:

•

Revenue and profitability growth:

•

Wealth Management

pre-tax

margin improvement to approximately 23% to
25% through net interest income growth via continued high-quality lending, expense efficiency and business growth;

•

Continued strength in Investment Banking and Equity Sales and Trading results;

•

Stable performance in Fixed Income Sales and Trading and Investment Management;

•

Expense efficiency:

•

Successful completion of Project Streamline, our expense savings program launched in 2016 to reduce expenses
by $1 billion by 2017 (not including any outsized litigation expense or penalties) assuming a flat revenue environment, resulting in an expense efficiency target ratio of 74%;

•

Sufficient capital:

•

Increasing capital returns to shareholders, subject to regulatory approval.

Our Return on Equity Target and the related strategies and goals are forward-looking statements that may be materially affected by many
factors, including, among other things: macroeconomic and market conditions; legislative and regulatory developments; industry trading and investment banking volumes; equity market levels; interest rate environment; legal expenses and the
ability to reduce expenses in general; capital levels; and discrete tax items. Given the uncertainties surrounding these and other factors, there are significant risks that our Return on Equity Target and the related strategies and goals may
not be realized. Actual results may differ from our goals and targets, and the differences may be material and adverse. Accordingly, we caution that undue reliance should not be placed on any of these forward-looking statements. See
“Forward-Looking Statements” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A for additional information regarding these forward-looking
statements.

Return on average common equity and

pre-tax

margin are

non-GAAP

financial measures that we consider to be a useful measure to us, investors and analysts to assess operating performance. See “Selected

Non-Generally

Accepted
Accounting Principles

(“Non-GAAP”)

Financial Information” herein. Our expense efficiency ratio represents total

non-interest

expenses as a percentage of
net revenues. For 2016, our expense efficiency ratio was 74.5%, which was calculated as

non-interest

expenses of $25,783 million divided by net revenues of $34,631 million.

Business Segments

Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and
expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues,

non-interest

expenses or other relevant measures.

As a result of treating certain intersegment transactions as transactions with external parties, we include an Intersegment Eliminations
category to reconcile the business segment results to our consolidated results.

Net Revenues

Investment Banking.

Investment banking revenues are composed of fees from advisory services and revenues from
the underwriting of securities offerings and syndication of loans, net of syndication expenses.

Trading.

Trading revenues include revenues from customers’ purchases and sales of financial
instruments in which we act as a market maker, as well as gains and losses on our related positions and other positions carried at fair value. Trading revenues include the realized gains and losses from sales of cash instruments and derivative
settlements, unrealized gains and losses from ongoing fair value changes of our positions related to market-making activities, and gains and losses related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans and other
positions carried at fair value. In many markets, the realized and unrealized gains and losses from the purchase and sale transactions will include any spreads between bids and offers. Certain fees received on loans carried at fair value and
dividends from equity securities are also recorded in Trading revenues since they relate to positions carried at fair value.

As a market
maker, we stand ready to buy, sell or otherwise transact with customers under a variety of market conditions and to provide firm or indicative prices in response to customer requests. Our liquidity obligations can be explicit in some cases, and in
others, customers expect us to be willing to transact with them. In order to most effectively fulfill our


December 2016 Form 10-K


Management’s Discussion and Analysis

market-making function, we engage in activities across all of our trading businesses that include, but are not limited to:

(i)

taking positions in anticipation of, and in response to, customer demand to buy or sell and—depending on
the liquidity of the relevant market and the size of the position—to hold those positions for a period of time;

(ii)

managing and assuming basis risk (risk associated with imperfect hedging) between customized customer risks
and the standardized products available in the market to hedge those risks;

(iii)

building, maintaining and rebalancing inventory, through trades with other market participants, and engaging
in accumulation activities to accommodate anticipated customer demand;

(iv)

trading in the market to remain current on pricing and trends; and

(v)

engaging in other activities to provide efficiency and liquidity for markets.

Although not included in Trading revenues, Interest income and expense are also impacted by market-making activities, as debt securities held
by us earn interest and securities are loaned, borrowed, sold with agreement to repurchase and purchased with agreement to resell.

We
often invest in investments or other financial instruments to economically hedge our obligations under certain deferred compensation plans. Changes in the value of such investments are recorded in either Trading revenues or Investments revenues.
Expenses associated with the related deferred compensation plans are recorded in Compensation and benefits. Generally, changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in fair value of the referenced investment will be offset by changes in
fair value of the investments made by us.

Investments.

Our investments generally are held for long-term
appreciation, or as discussed above, for hedging purposes and generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Estimates of the fair value of the investments may involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light
of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions. In some cases, such investments are required or are a necessary part of offering other products.

The revenues recorded are the result of realized gains and losses from sales and unrealized gains and losses from ongoing fair value changes
of our holdings, as well as from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation and

co-investment

plans.

Typically, there are no fee revenues from these investments. The sales restrictions on the
investments relate primarily to redemption and withdrawal restrictions on investments in certain Investment Management funds, which include investments made in connection with certain employee deferred compensation plans (see Note 3 to the
consolidated financial statements in Item 8). Restrictions on interests in exchanges and clearinghouses generally include a requirement to hold those interests for the period of time where we are clearing trades on that exchange or clearinghouse.
Additionally, there are certain sponsored Investment Management funds consolidated by us primarily related to holders of noncontrolling interests.

Commissions and Fees.

Commission and fee revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and

over-the-counter

(“OTC”) equity securities, services related to sales and trading activities, and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options.
Commissions received for purchasing and selling listed equity securities and options are recorded separately in Commissions and fees. Other cash and derivative instruments typically do not have fees associated with them, and fees for any related
services are recorded in Commissions and fees.

Asset Management, Distribution and Administration
Fees.

Asset management, distribution and administration fees include fees associated with the management and supervision of assets, account services and administration, performance-based fees relating to certain
funds, separately managed accounts, shareholder servicing and the distribution of certain open-ended mutual funds.

Asset management,
distribution and administration fees in the Wealth Management business segment also include revenues from individual and institutional investors electing a

fee-based

pricing arrangement and fees for Investment
Management. Mutual fund distribution fees in the Wealth Management business segment are based on either the average daily fund net asset balances or average daily aggregate net fund sales and are affected by changes in the overall level and mix of
assets under management or supervision.

Asset management fees in the Investment Management business segment arise from investment
management services we provide to investment vehicles pursuant to various contractual arrangements. We receive fees primarily based upon mutual fund daily average net assets or based on monthly or quarterly invested equity for other vehicles.
Performance-based fees in the Investment Management business segment are earned on certain products as a percentage of appreciation earned by those products and, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement of performance criteria. These fees
are normally earned annually and are recognized on a monthly or quarterly basis.

Net Interest.

Interest income and Interest expense are a
function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including Trading assets and Trading liabilities; Investment securities, which include available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities and held-to-maturity (“HTM”) securities;
Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell; Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase; Loans; Deposits; Other short-term borrowings; Long-term borrowings; trading strategies; customer activity in the prime brokerage
business; and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates.

Other.

Other
revenues include revenues from equity method investments, realized gains and losses on AFS securities, gains and losses on loans held for sale, provision for loan losses, and other miscellaneous revenues.

Net Revenues by Segment

Institutional Securities.

Net revenues are composed of Investment banking revenues, Sales and trading net
revenues, Investments and Other revenues.

For information about the composition of Investment banking revenues, see “Net
Revenues” herein.

Sales and trading net revenues are composed of Trading revenues; Commissions and fees; Asset
management, distribution and administration fees; and Net interest. In assessing the profitability of our sales and trading activities, we view these net revenues in the aggregate. In addition, decisions relating to trading are based on an overall
review of aggregate revenues and costs associated with each transaction or series of transactions. This review includes, among other things, an assessment of the potential gain or loss associated with a transaction, including any associated
commissions and fees, dividends, the interest income or expense associated with financing or hedging our positions and other related expenses.

Sales and trading revenues are broken down into major business lines as follows: equity, fixed income and other. See “Sales and Trading
Activities—Equity and Fixed Income” for a description of the activities within equity and fixed income. Other sales and trading revenues include impacts from certain central treasury functions, such as liquidity costs and gains (losses) on
economic hedges related to long-term borrowings, as well as certain activities associated with corporate lending activities.

For
information about revenue from Investments, see “Net Revenues” herein.

Other revenues include revenues from equity method
investments, gains and losses on loans held for sale, provision for loan losses, and other miscellaneous revenues.

Wealth
Management.

Net revenues are composed of Transactional, Asset management, Net interest and Other revenues.

Transactional revenues include Investment banking, Trading, and Commissions and fees. Investment
banking revenues include revenues from the distribution of equity and fixed income securities, including initial public offerings, secondary offerings,

closed-end

funds and unit trusts. Trading revenues
include revenues from customers’ purchases and sales of financial instruments, in which we act as principal, and gains and losses associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans. Revenues from Commissions and fees primarily arise
from agency transactions in listed and OTC equity securities and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options.

Asset
management revenues include Asset management, distribution and administration fees, and referral fees related to the bank deposit program.

Net interest income includes interest related to the bank deposit program, interest on AFS securities and HTM securities, interest on lending
activities and other net interest. Interest income and Interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities. Net interest is driven by securities-based lending, mortgage lending, margin loans, securities borrowed and
securities loaned transactions, and bank deposit program activity.

Other revenues include revenues from realized gains and losses on AFS
securities, provision for loan losses, referral fees and other miscellaneous revenues.

Investment
Management.

Investments revenue is primarily earned on investments in certain

closed-end

funds that generally are held for long-term appreciation and generally subject to
sales restrictions. Estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate materially over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions.

For information about the composition of Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees, see “Net Revenues”
herein.

Compensation Expense

Compensation and benefits expense includes accruals for base salaries and fixed allowances, formulaic programs, discretionary incentive
compensation, amortization of deferred cash and equity awards, changes in fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments, carried interest, severance costs, and other items such as health and welfare benefits. The factors that drive
compensation for our employees vary from quarter to quarter, from segment to segment and within a segment. For certain revenue-producing employees in the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, compensation is largely paid


December 2016 Form 10-K


Management’s Discussion and Analysis

on the basis of formulaic payouts that link employee compensation to revenues. Compensation for certain employees, including revenue-producing employees in the Institutional Securities business
segment, may also include incentive compensation that is determined following the assessment of the Firm, business unit and individual performance. Compensation for our remaining employees is largely fixed in nature (e.g., base salary, benefits,
etc.).

Compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation plans is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted,
adjusted for upward and downward changes in fair value of the referenced investment, and is recognized ratably over the prescribed vesting period for the award. However, there may be a timing difference between the immediate revenue recognition of
gains and losses on our investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period.

Income Taxes

The income tax provision for our business segments is generally determined based on the revenues, expenses and activities
directly attributable to each business segment. Certain items have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues or other relevant
measures.

Source: Thomson Reuters, data at January 17, 2017. Completed mergers and acquisitions volumes are based on full
credit to each of the advisors in a transaction. Equity and equity-related offerings and fixed income offerings are based on full credit for single book managers and equal credit for joint book managers. Transaction volumes may not be indicative of
net revenues in a given period. In addition, transaction volumes for prior periods may vary from amounts previously reported due to the subsequent withdrawal or change in the value of a transaction.

Amounts include Rule 144A issuances and registered public offerings of common stock and convertible securities and

Amounts include

non-convertible

preferred stock, mortgage-backed and

issuances.

2016 Compared with 2015

Investment
banking revenues of $4,476 million in 2016 decreased 11% from 2015 due to lower underwriting revenues, partially offset by an increase in advisory revenues in 2016.

•

Advisory revenues increased reflecting the higher dollar volume of completed merger, acquisition and
restructuring transactions (“M&A”) activity (see Investment Banking Volumes table). As the number of completed transactions decreased in 2016 versus 2015, the 2016 revenue increase was at a lower rate than the percentage increase
in dollar volume.

•

Equity underwriting revenues decreased as a result of lower equity-related offerings in 2016 (see Investment
Banking Volumes table). Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased in 2016, primarily due to lower bond and loan fees.

Compared with 2014

Investment banking revenues of $5,008 million in 2015 decreased 4% from 2014 due to lower underwriting
revenues, partially offset by higher advisory revenues.

•

Advisory revenues increased led primarily by M&A fee realization in the Americas.

•

Equity underwriting revenues decreased on reduced volumes driven by lower initial public offerings (see
Investment Banking Volumes table). Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased primarily driven by lower

non-investment

grade bond and loan fees.

Sales and Trading Activities

—

Equity and Fixed Income

Following is a description of the sales and trading activities within our equities and fixed income businesses as well as

how their results impact the income statement line items, followed by a presentation and explanation of results.

Equities—Financing.

We provide financing and prime brokerage services to our clients active in the equity
markets through a variety of products including margin lending, securities lending and swaps. Results from this business are largely driven by the difference between financing income earned and financing costs incurred, which are reflected in Net
interest for securities and equity lending products and in Trading revenues for derivative products.

Equities—Execution
services.

We make markets for our clients in equity-related securities and derivative products, including providing liquidity and hedging products. A significant portion of the results for this business is generated by
commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on major stock and derivative exchanges as well as from OTC transactions. Market-making also generates gains and losses on inventory, which are reflected in Trading revenues.

Fixed income—

Within fixed income we make markets in order to facilitate client activity as part of the following products and
services.

•

Global macro products.

We make markets for our clients in interest rate, foreign
exchange and emerging market products, including exchange-traded and OTC securities, loans and derivative instruments. The results of this market-making activity are primarily driven by gains and losses from buying and selling positions to stand
ready for and satisfy client demand and are recorded in Trading revenues.

•

Credit products.

We make markets in credit-sensitive products, such as corporate
bonds and mortgage securities and other securitized products, and related derivative instruments. The value of positions in this business are sensitive to changes in credit spreads and interest rates, which result in gains and losses reflected in
Trading revenues. Due to the amount and type of the interest-bearing securities and loans making up this business, a significant portion of the results is also reflected in Net interest revenues.

•

Commodities products.

We make markets in various commodity products related
primarily to electricity, natural gas, oil, and precious metals, with the results primarily reflected in Trading revenues.

In 2016, in accordance with the early adoption of a provision of the accounting update

Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

, unrealized DVA gains (losses) are recorded within OCI in the consolidated comprehensive income statements. In 2015 and 2014, the DVA gains (losses) were recorded within Trading revenues in the
consolidated income statements. See Notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.

As discussed in “Net Revenues by Segment” herein, we manage each of the sales and trading businesses based on its aggregate net
revenues, which are comprised of the consolidated income statement line items quantified in the previous table. Trading revenues are affected by a variety of market dynamics, including volumes,

bid-offer

spreads, and inventory prices, as well as impacts from hedging activity, which are interrelated. We provide qualitative commentary in the discussion of results that follow on the key drivers of period

over period variances, as the quantitative impact of the various market dynamics typically cannot be disaggregated.

For additional information on total Trading revenues, see the table “Trading Revenues by Product Type” in Note 4 to the consolidated
financial statements in Item 8.

2016 Compared with 2015

Equity

Excluding the
$163 million positive impact of DVA on 2015 results, equity sales and trading net revenues of $8,037 million in 2016 were lower than 2015, reflecting lower results in both financing and execution services revenues.

•

Financing revenues were in line with the results from 2015 as Net interest revenues declined from higher net
interest costs, reflecting the business’ increased portion of global liquidity reserve requirements, offset by increased client activity in equity swaps reflected in Trading.

•

Execution services decreased 2% from 2015, primarily reflecting a decrease in fee revenues of
$196 million due to reduced client activity.

Fixed Income

Excluding the $455 million positive impact of DVA on 2015 results, fixed income net revenues of $5,117 million in 2016 were 19%
higher than 2015, primarily due to improved results in credit products.

•

Credit products Trading revenues were the primary driver for the overall increase in fixed income Trading
revenues of $782 million, reflecting an improved credit market environment that resulted in gains on inventory in 2016 compared with losses in 2015.

•

Overall results from other fixed income businesses were relatively unchanged. There was a net increase in
Trading revenues from global macro products, reflecting gains on inventory in interest rate products, offset by declines in commodities activities, primarily due to the absence of revenues from the global oil merchanting business, which was sold on
November 1, 2015. For more information on the sale of the global oil merchanting business, see “Investments, Other Revenues,

Non-interest

Expenses, Income Tax Items, Dispositions and Other
Items—2015 Compared with 2014—Dispositions” herein.

Other

•

Other sales and trading net losses of $853 million in 2016 increased from 2015, primarily reflecting
losses in 2016 associated with corporate loan hedging activity.


December 2016 Form 10-K


Management’s Discussion and Analysis

2015 Compared with 2014

Equity

Equity sales and trading
net revenues, excluding the impact of DVA and the implementation of FVA, increased reflecting higher results in financing and execution services revenues.

•

Financing revenues increased 19% from 2014 with an increase in client balances and derivative activity
reflected in the $457 million increase in Trading revenues primarily from equity swaps and a $103 million increase in Net interest revenues for securities.

•

Execution services increased 17% from 2014, primarily due to the $587 million increase in Trading
revenues from client activity in derivatives and reduced inventory losses compared with the prior year.

Fixed Income

Excluding the $455 million positive impact of DVA on 2015 results, and the $419 million positive impact of DVA and the
$466 million negative impact from the implementation of FVA on 2014 results, fixed income net revenues of $4,303 million in 2015 were 1% higher than 2014 due to improved results in global macro and commodities products, offset by lower
results in credit products.

•

Global macro products results increased from 2014, primarily due to an increase in Trading revenues due to
improved results in interest rate products as a result of inventory gains and improved performance in foreign exchange products

•

Credit products decreased, primarily driven by a decrease in Trading revenues from lower results in credit and
securitized products from a widening credit spread environment, which led to inventory losses. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in Net interest revenues, driven primarily by a change in the product mix in the securitized products
group assets.

•

Commodities products net revenues increased, primarily reflecting higher revenues from the global oil
merchanting business, which was sold on November 1, 2015. The increase was partially offset by credit-driven losses and the absence of revenues from TransMontaigne Inc., which was sold on July 1, 2014 (see “Investments, Other
Revenues,

Non-interest

Expenses, Income Tax Items, Dispositions and Other Items—2015 Compared with 2014—Dispositions” herein).

Expenses, Income Tax
Items, Dispositions and Other Items

2016 Compared with 2015

Investments

•

Net investment gains of $147 million in 2016 decreased from 2015 as a result of lower gains on real
estate and business-related investments and losses on investments associated with our compensation plans compared with gains in 2015.

Other

•

Other revenues of $535 million in 2016 increased from 2015, primarily reflecting

mark-to-market

gains on loans held for sale in 2016 compared with

mark-to-market

losses in
2015, partially offset by lower results related to our 40% stake in Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd. (“MUMSS”) (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information).

Non-interest

Expenses

Non-interest

expenses of $12,336 million in 2016 decreased from 2015, primarily reflecting a 3%
reduction in Compensation and benefits expenses and an 11% reduction in

Non-compensation

expenses in 2016.

•

Compensation and benefits expenses decreased in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in salaries, severance
costs, discretionary incentive compensation and employer taxes, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments.

•

Non-compensation

expenses decreased in 2016, primarily due to lower
litigation costs and Professional services expense. In 2015,

Non-compensation

expenses included increases to reserves for the settlement of a credit default swap (“CDS”) antitrust litigation matter
and legacy residential mortgage-backed securities matters.

2015 Compared with 2014

Investments

•

Net investment gains of $274 million in 2015 increased 14% from 2014 driven by gains on business-related
investments.

Other

•

Other revenues of $221 million in 2015 decreased 68% from 2014 due to the absence of gains realized on
certain assets sold in 2014 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) and markdowns and provisions on loans held for sale and held for investment.

December 2016 Form 10-K



Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Non-interest

Expenses

Non-interest

expenses of $13,282 million in 2015 decreased 22% from 2014 driven by a 25%
reduction in

Non-compensation

expenses and a 17% reduction in Compensation and benefits expenses.

•

Compensation and benefits expenses decreased, primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions, a decrease in
the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments and a decrease in the level of discretionary incentive compensation in 2015 (see also “Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures—Discretionary Incentive
Compensation” herein).

•

Non-compensation

expenses decreased, primarily due to lower litigation
costs.

Income Tax Items

In 2016, we recognized in Provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of $83 million. These net discrete tax
benefits were primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters.

In 2015, we recognized in Provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of $564 million. These net discrete tax
benefits were primarily associated with the repatriation of

non-U.S.

earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated due to an internal restructuring to simplify our legal entity organization in the United
Kingdom (“U.K.”).

In 2014, we recognized in Provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of
$839 million. This included net discrete tax benefits of $612 million principally associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination and
$237 million primarily associated with the repatriation of

non-U.S.

earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated. In addition, our Provision for (benefit from) income taxes was impacted by
approximately $900 million of tax provision as a result of

non-deductible

expenses related to litigation and regulatory matters.

Dispositions

On November 1, 2015, we completed the sale of our global oil merchanting unit of the commodities division to Castleton Commodities
International LLC. The loss on sale of approximately $71 million was recognized in Other revenues.

On July 1, 2014, we
completed the sale of our ownership stake in TransMontaigne Inc., a U.S.-based oil storage, marketing and transportation company, as well as related physical inventory and the assumption of our obligations under certain terminal storage contracts,
to NGL Energy Partners LP. The gain on sale of $112 million was recognized in Other revenues.

On March 27, 2014, we completed
the sale of Canterm Canadian Terminals Inc., a public storage terminal operator for refined products with two distribution terminals in Canada. The gain on sale was approximately $45 million and was recognized in Other revenues.

Other Items

Japanese Securities Joint Venture

We hold a 40% voting interest and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (“MUFG”) holds a 60% voting interest in MUMSS.

To the extent that losses incurred by MUMSS result in a requirement to restore its capital level, MUFG is solely responsible for
providing this additional capital to a minimum level, whereas we are not obligated to contribute additional capital to MUMSS. To the extent that MUMSS is required to increase its capital level due to factors other than losses, such as changes in
regulatory requirements, both MUFG and we are required to contribute the necessary capital based upon the economic interest as set forth above.

See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.

Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests primarily relate to MUFG’s interest in Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co., Ltd.

Effective July 1, 2016, the Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments entered into an
agreement, whereby Institutional Securities assumed management of Wealth Management’s fixed income client-driven trading activities and employees. Institutional Securities now pays fees to Wealth Management based on distribution activity
(collectively, the “Fixed Income Integration”). Prior periods have not been recast for this new intersegment agreement due to immateriality.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

2016 Compared with 2015

Net Revenues

Transactional Revenues

Transactional revenues of $3,090 million in 2016 decreased 7% from the prior year, primarily reflecting lower revenues related to
commissions and fees and investment banking revenues, partially offset by higher trading revenues.

•

Investment banking revenues decreased in 2016, primarily due to lower revenues from the distribution of unit
investment trusts, equity and structured products.

•

Trading revenues increased in 2016, primarily due to gains related to investments associated with certain
employee deferred compensation plans compared with losses in 2015.

•

Commissions and fees decreased in 2016 reflecting lower daily average commissions, primarily due to reduced
client activity in equity, annuity and mutual fund products. This decrease was partially offset by increased fees due to the Fixed Income Integration.

Asset Management

Asset
management, distribution and administration fees of $8,454 million in 2016 decreased 1% from the prior year, primarily due to the decrease in mutual fund fees. Revenues from

fee-based

accounts were
relatively flat with decreased client fee rates, partially offset by positive flows. See

“Fee-Based

Client Assets Activity and Average Fee Rate by Account Type” herein for more details.

Net Interest

Net interest of
$3,529 million in 2016 increased 19% from the prior year, primarily due to higher loan balances and investment portfolio yields.

Other

Other revenues of $277 million in 2016 increased 9% from the prior year due to the combination of higher referral fees in
2016 and a decrease in provision for loan losses in 2016.

Non-interest

Expenses

Non-interest

expenses of $11,913 million in 2016 increased 1% from the prior year.

•

Compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2016, primarily due to an increase in the fair value of
deferred compensation plan referenced investments.

•

Non-compensation expenses increased in 2016, primarily as a result of a $70 million provision related to
certain brokerage service reporting activities. See “Other Items” herein.

2015 Compared with 2014

Net Revenues

Transactional Revenues

Transactional revenues of $3,335 million in 2015 decreased 14% from the prior year due to lower revenues in each of Trading, Investment
banking, and Commissions and fees.

•

Investment banking revenues decreased, primarily due to lower revenues from the distribution of underwritten
offerings.

•

Trading revenues decreased, primarily due to losses related to investments associated with certain employee
deferred compensation plans and lower revenues from fixed income products.

•

Commissions and fees decreased, primarily due to lower revenues from equity, mutual fund and annuity products,
partially offset by higher revenues from alternative asset classes.

Asset Management

Asset management, distribution and administration fees of $8,536 million in 2015 increased 2% from the prior year, primarily due to
higher

fee-based

revenues that resulted from positive flows and higher average market values over 2015 as compared with the average market values during 2014. The increase in

fee-based

revenues was partially offset by lower referral fees from the bank deposit program, reflecting the completion of the transfer of deposits from Citigroup Inc. (“Citi”) to us in connection
with the former retail securities joint venture between the Firm and Citi. See

“Fee-Based

Client Assets Activity and Average Fee Rate by Account Type” herein for more details.

Net Interest

Net interest of
$2,956 million in 2015 increased 26% from the prior year, primarily due to higher balances in the bank deposit program and growth in loans and lending commitments.

Other

Other revenues of
$255 million in 2015 decreased 20% from the prior year, primarily due to a $40 million gain on sale of a retail property space in the prior year and an increase in the provision for loan losses in 2015.


December 2016 Form 10-K


Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Non-interest

Expenses

Non-interest

expenses of $11,768 million in 2015 decreased 1% from the prior year, primarily due
to lower Compensation and benefit expenses, partially offset by higher

Non-compensation

expenses.

•

Compensation and benefits expenses decreased, primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions, a decrease in
the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments and a decrease in the level of discretionary incentive compensation in 2015 (see also “Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures—Discretionary Incentive
Compensation” herein).

•

Non-compensation

expenses increased, primarily due to an increase in
Professional services, resulting from increased consulting and legal fees, partially offset by a provision related to a rescission offer in the prior year. Other expenses in 2014 included $50 million related to a rescission offer to Wealth
Management clients who may not have received a prospectus for certain securities transactions, for which delivery of a prospectus was required.

Income Tax Items

In 2014, we recognized
in Provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of $1,390 million due

to the release of a deferred tax liability as a result of an internal restructuring to simplify our legal entity organization. For a further discussion of these net discrete tax benefits, see
“Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures—Income Tax Matters” herein.

Other Items

The Firm has identified operational issues that resulted in the reporting of incorrect cost basis tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) and retail brokerage clients for tax years 2011 through 2016. Most of our clients are not impacted by these issues. However, these issues have affected a significant number of client accounts. In the case of clients for
whom the Firm has determined that there have been tax underpayments to the IRS as a result of these issues, the Firm is in advanced discussions with the IRS to resolve client tax underpayments to the IRS caused by these issues at no expense to our
clients. In the case of clients for whom the Firm has determined that there have been tax overpayments to the IRS as a result of these issues, the Firm plans to notify them and to offer to pay them an amount equivalent to their overpayment to the
IRS. The $70 million provision referred to above is based on currently available information and analyses, and our review of these issues is continuing.

Fee-Based

Client Assets Activity and Average Fee Rate by Account Type

Wealth Management earns fees based on a contractual percentage of

fee-based

client assets related to
certain account types that we offer. These fees, which we record in the Asset management, distribution and administration fees line on its income statement, are earned based on the client assets in the specific account types in which the client
participates and are generally not driven by asset class. For most account types, fees are billed in the first month of each quarter based on the related client assets as of the end of the prior quarter. Across the account types, fees will vary
based on both the distinct services provided within each account type and on the level of household assets under supervision in Wealth Management.

2016 Compared with 2015

Net Revenues

Investments

•

Investments gains of $13 million in 2016 decreased 95% from the prior year reflecting weaker investment
performance compared with the prior year. This was partially offset by carried interest losses in 2015 associated with Asia private equity that did not

re-occur

in 2016.

Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees

•

Asset management, distribution and administration fees of $2,063 million in 2016 were relatively
unchanged from the prior year, as increases in management fees resulting from higher assets under management or supervision (“AUM”) and average fee rates in certain products were offset by lower performance fees (see “AUM and Average
Fee Rate by Asset Class” herein).

Non-interest

Expenses

Non-interest

expenses of $1,825 million in 2016 were relatively unchanged from the prior year,
primarily due to higher

Non-compensation

expenses offset by lower Compensation and benefits expenses.

•

Compensation and benefits expenses decreased, primarily due to a decrease in salaries.

•

Non-compensation

expenses increased, primarily due to higher brokerage
clearing and exchange fees, partially offset by lower litigation costs and expense management.

2015 Compared with 2014

Net Revenues

Investments

•

Investments gains of $249 million in 2015 decreased 58% from the prior year reflecting the reversal of
previously accrued carried interest associated with Asia private equity and additional net markdowns on principal investments.

Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees

•

Asset management, distribution and administration fees were unchanged from the prior year as the impact of
positive net flows was offset by a shift in the asset class mix from equity and fixed income products to liquidity products (see “AUM and Average Fee Rate by Asset Class” herein).

Other

•

Other revenues of $32 million in 2015 decreased 70% from the prior year due to lower revenues associated
with our minority investment in certain third-party investment managers.

Non-interest

Expenses

Non-interest

expenses of $1,823 million in 2015 decreased 11% from the prior
year, primarily due to lower Compensation and benefit expenses, partially offset by higher

Non-compensation

expenses.

•

Compensation and benefits expenses decreased, primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions, a decrease in
deferred compensation associated with carried interest and a decrease in the level of incentive compensation in 2015 (see also “Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures—Discretionary Incentive Compensation” herein).

•

Non-compensation

Supplemental
Financial Information and Disclosures

Legal

We incurred legal expenses of $263 million in 2016, $563 million in 2015 and $3,364 million in 2014. Legal expenses are
included in Other expenses in the consolidated income statements.

Legal expenses incurred in 2015 were primarily related to increases
in reserves for the settlement of a credit default swap antitrust litigation matter and for legacy residential mortgage-backed securities matters. The legal expenses incurred in 2014 were principally due to reserve additions and settlements
related to legacy residential mortgage-backed securities and credit crisis related matters, including our $2,600 million agreement with the United States Department of Justice, Civil Division, which was reached on February 25, 2015 and
finalized on February 10, 2016 (see “Contingencies—Legal” in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).

U.S. Bank Subsidiaries

We provide loans to a variety of customers, from large corporate and institutional clients to high net worth individuals, primarily through
our U.S. bank subsidiaries, Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. (“MSBNA”) and Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association (“MSPBNA”) (collectively, “U.S. Bank Subsidiaries”). The lending activities in the Institutional
Securities business segment primarily include loans or lending commitments to corporate clients. The lending activities in the Wealth Management business segment primarily include securities-based lending that allows clients to borrow money against
the value of qualifying securities and also include residential real estate loans. We expect our lending activities to continue to grow through further market penetration of the Wealth Management business segment’s client base. For a further
discussion of our credit risks, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management—Credit Risk” in Item 7A. For further discussion about loans and lending commitments, see Notes 7 and 12 to the
consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis


Included in the effective tax rate for 2016 were net discrete tax benefits of $68 million, primarily related to the remeasurement of
reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters. Excluding these net discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rate from
continuing operations for 2016 would have been 31.6%, which is generally reflective of the geographic mix of earnings.


Included in the effective tax rate for 2015 were net discrete tax benefits of $564 million, primarily associated with the repatriation of

non-U.S.

earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated due to an internal restructuring to simplify the legal entity organization in the U.K. Excluding these net discrete tax benefits, the effective tax
rate from continuing operations for 2015 would have been 32.5%.


Included in the effective tax rate for 2014 were net discrete tax benefits of $2,226 million. These net discrete tax benefits consisted
of: $1,380 million primarily due to the release of a deferred tax liability, previously established as part of the acquisition of Smith Barney in 2009 through a charge to Additional

paid-in

capital, as a
result of the legal entity restructuring that included a change in tax status of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Holdings LLC from a partnership to a corporation; $609 million principally associated with the remeasurement of reserves and related
interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination; and $237 million primarily associated with the repatriation of

non-U.S.

earnings at a cost lower than
originally estimated. Excluding these net discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2014 would have been 59.5%, which is primarily attributable to approximately $900 million of tax provision from

non-deductible

expenses for litigation and regulatory matters.

On December 1, 2014, the Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee (“CMDS Committee”) of our Board of
Directors (the “Board”) approved an approach for awards of discretionary incentive compensation for the 2014 performance year that were granted in 2015, which reduced the average deferral of such awards to an approximate baseline of 50%.
Additionally, the CMDS Committee approved the acceleration of vesting for certain outstanding deferred cash-based incentive compensation awards. The deferred cash-based incentive compensation

awards subject to accelerated vesting will be distributed on their regularly scheduled future distribution dates and will continue to be subject to cancellation and clawback provisions. The
following table presents the increase in Compensation and benefits expense for the Firm and each of the business segments as a result of these actions in 2014 (“2014 compensation actions”).

Accounting Development Updates

The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued the following accounting updates that apply to us.

We consider the applicability and impact of all accounting updates. Accounting updates not listed below were assessed and determined to be
either not applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

The following accounting
update was adopted on January 1, 2017.

•

Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

.    This accounting update
simplifies the accounting for employee share-based payments, including the recognition of forfeitures, the classification of income tax consequences, and the classification within the cash flow statements. This guidance became effective for us as of
January 1, 2017, and the transition impact was not significant. With this update, the income tax consequences for these payments are required to be recognized in Provision for income taxes in the consolidated income statements instead of additional
paid-in capital. The impact of the income tax consequences may be either a benefit or a provision, and will primarily occur in the

first quarter of each year as share-based awards to

employees are

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

converted to Morgan Stanley shares. The impact of recognizing excess tax benefits upon conversion of awards in January 2017 was an approximate $110 million benefit to the Provision for income
taxes.

The following accounting updates are currently being evaluated to determine the potential impact of adoption:

•

Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

This accounting update aims to clarify
the principles of revenue recognition, to develop a common revenue recognition standard across all industries for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards, and to provide enhanced disclosures for users of the financial statements.
The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenues to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for
those goods or services. We will adopt the guidance on January 1, 2018 and are currently evaluating the method of adoption.

We expect this accounting update to potentially change the timing and presentation of certain revenues, as well as the timing
and presentation of certain related costs, for Investment banking fees and Asset management, distribution and administration fees. Outside of Investment Management performance fees in the form of carried interest, discussed further in the following
paragraph, these changes are not expected to be significant.

Regarding the recognition of performance fees from fund
management activities in the form of carried interest that are subject to reversal, there are alternative views in the industry which include consideration as to whether these arrangements are in the scope of the new revenue guidance or are
financial instruments under the scope of equity method of accounting. If we follow the equity method of accounting principles, the current recognition of such fees would remain essentially unchanged. If the fees are deemed in the scope of the
new revenue guidance, we would defer recognition until such fees are no longer subject to reversal, which would cause a significant delay in the recognition of these fees as revenue. We are currently assessing the alternative accounting approaches
and continue to closely monitor developments in this still-evolving area.

We will continue to assess the impact of the
new rule as we progress through the implementation of the new standard; therefore, additional impacts may be identified prior to adoption.

•

Financial Instruments—Credit Losses.

This accounting update impacts the
impairment model for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost such as loans held for investment and HTM securities. The amendments in this

update will accelerate the recognition of credit losses by replacing the incurred loss impairment methodology with a current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology that requires an
estimate of expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial asset. Additionally, although the CECL methodology will not apply to AFS debt securities, the update will require establishment of an allowance to reflect impairment of these
securities, thereby eliminating the concept of a permanent write-down. This update is effective as of January 1, 2020.

•

Leases.

This accounting update requires lessees to recognize on the balance
sheet all leases with terms exceeding one year, which results in the recognition of a right of use asset and corresponding lease liability, including for those leases that we currently classify as operating leases. The right of use asset and lease
liability will initially be measured using the present value of the remaining rental payments. The accounting for leases where we are the lessor is largely unchanged. This update is effective as of January 1, 2019.

•

Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets.

This accounting
update clarifies the guidance on how to account for the derecognition of nonfinancial assets and in substance nonfinancial assets and also provides guidance on the accounting for partial sales of nonfinancial assets. This update is effective as of
January 1, 2018.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note
1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.

Fair Value

Financial Instruments Measured at
Fair Value

A significant number of our financial instruments are carried at fair value. We make estimates regarding valuation of
assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These assets and liabilities include, but are not limited to:

•

Trading assets and Trading liabilities;

•

Investment Securities—AFS securities;

•

Certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell;

•

Certain Deposits, primarily structured certificates of deposits;

December 2016 Form 10-K



Management’s Discussion and Analysis

•

Certain Short-term borrowings, primarily structured notes;

•

Certain Securities sold under agreements to repurchase;

•

Certain Other secured financings; and

•

Certain Long-term borrowings, primarily structured notes.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (

i.e.

, the exit price) in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches.
A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available. The
hierarchy is broken down into three levels, wherein Level 1 represents quoted prices in active markets, Level 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable,
and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, require the greatest use of judgment. In periods of market disruption, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many
instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be recategorized from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many
instruments. For further information on the valuation process, fair value definition, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation techniques, and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs
used in Level 3 fair value measurements, see Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

Where appropriate,
valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk

(bid-ask

adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty and concentration risk in order to arrive at fair value. For a
further discussion of valuation adjustments that we apply, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

Assets and Liabilities
Measured at Fair Value on a

Non-recurring

Basis

At December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, certain of our assets and liabilities were measured at fair value on a

non-recurring

basis, primarily relating to loans, other investments, premises, equipment and software costs,
intangible assets, other assets and other liabilities, and accrued expenses. We incur losses or gains for any adjustments of these assets to fair value. A downturn in market conditions could result in impairment charges in future periods.

For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a

non-recurring

basis, fair value is determined by using various valuation approaches. The same hierarchy as described above, which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable
inputs by generally requiring that the observable inputs be used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these items.

See
Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a

non-recurring

basis.

Fair Value Control Processes

We
employ control processes designed to validate the fair value of our financial instruments, including those derived from pricing models. These control processes are designed to ensure that the values used for financial reporting are based on
observable inputs wherever possible. In the event that observable inputs are not available, the control processes are designed to ensure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are
reasonable.

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding our valuation policies,
processes and procedures.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill

We test goodwill for
impairment on an annual basis on July 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. We test for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below its business segments.
Goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit. As such, all the activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically developed, are available to support the value of
the goodwill. For both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of
a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.

If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the

two-step

impairment test is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, then we are
required to perform the first step of the

two-step

impairment test. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value. If the
estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value,


December 2016 Form 10-K


Management’s Discussion and Analysis

goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is below carrying value, however, further analysis is required to determine the amount of the
impairment.

The estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would
use for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair value is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate

price-to-book

and

price-to-earnings

multiples of certain comparable companies. At each
annual goodwill impairment testing date, each of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value.

Intangible Assets

Amortizable
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life and are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair
value. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected
undiscounted cash flows.

For both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes
the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset. Adverse market or economic events could
result in impairment charges in future periods.

See Notes 2, 3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional
information about goodwill and intangible assets.

Legal and Regulatory Contingencies

In the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations,
class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution.

Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for
indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress.

We are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by

governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business and involving, among other matters, sales and trading activities, wealth and investment management services, financial products or
offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by us, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.

Accruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a

case-by-case

basis. Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and we can reasonably estimate the amount of
that loss, we accrue the estimated loss by a charge to income. In many proceedings, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss.

For certain legal proceedings and investigations, we can estimate possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional
loss in excess of amounts accrued. For certain other legal proceedings and investigations, we cannot reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where
plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be
reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other
relief, and addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question.

Significant judgment
is required in deciding when and if to make these accruals, and the actual cost of a legal claim or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals.

See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on legal proceedings.

Income Taxes

We are subject to the
income and indirect tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and
the relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also make
estimates about when certain items affect taxable income in the various

December 2016 Form 10-K



Management’s Discussion and Analysis

tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each
taxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years’ examinations, and unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits are established in accordance with the guidance on accounting for
unrecognized tax benefits. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change.

Our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for
the current period. Our deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be
in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. Our deferred tax balances also include deferred assets related to tax attribute carryforwards, such as net operating losses and tax credits that will be realized through reduction of future
tax liabilities and, in some cases, are subject to expiration if not utilized within certain periods. We perform regular reviews to ascertain whether deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include management’s

estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income and incorporate various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to tax attribute carryforwards before they
expire. Once the deferred tax asset balances have been determined, we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset balances to reflect the amount of these balances (net of valuation allowance) that we estimate it is more likely
than not to realize at a future date. Both current and deferred income taxes could reflect adjustments related to our unrecognized tax benefits.

Significant judgment is required in estimating the consolidated provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances
(including valuation allowance, if any), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. Revisions in estimates and/or the actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized
tax benefits, if any.

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our significant
assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our tax examinations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Senior management establishes liquidity and capital policies. Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business
performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. The Treasury Department, Firm Risk
Committee, Asset and Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our consolidated balance sheets, liquidity and capital
structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Board’s Risk Committee.

The Balance Sheet

We monitor and evaluate the composition and size of our balance sheet on a regular basis. Our balance sheet management process includes
quarterly planning, business-specific thresholds, monitoring of business-specific usage versus key performance metrics and new business impact assessments.

We establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated, business segment and business unit levels. We monitor balance sheet utilization and
review variances resulting from business activity or market fluctuations. On a regular basis, we review current performance versus established thresholds and assess the need to

re-allocate

our balance sheet
based on business unit needs. We also monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size and capital usage.

A substantial portion of total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales and
trading activities in the Institutional Securities business segment. Total assets increased to $815 billion at December 31, 2016 from $787 billion at December 31, 2015, primarily due to increases in Trading assets within
Institutional Securities, including increases in highly liquid U.S. government and agency securities and corporate equities. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in Securities borrowed driven by a decrease in Trading
liabilities. Cash and cash equivalent balances resulting from bank deposits continued to be redeployed into Investment securities and lending activity primarily within the Wealth Management business segment.

Securities Repurchase Agreements and Securities Lending

Securities borrowed or securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or securities sold under agreements to repurchase
are treated as collateralized financings (see Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).

At December 31, 2016, differences between period end balances and average balances during the three

2015 were lower than the average balances during 2015. The balances moved in line with client financing activity and with general movements in Trading assets and liabilities. Additionally, included within securities financing transactions were
$14 billion and $11 billion at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, related to fully collateralized

securities-for-securities

lending transactions represented in Trading assets.

Customer Securities Financing

The customer receivable portion of the securities financing transactions primarily includes customer margin loans, collateralized by
customer-owned securities, which are segregated in accordance with regulatory requirements. The customer payable portion of the securities financing transactions primarily includes payables to our prime brokerage customers. Our risk exposure on
these transactions is mitigated by collateral maintenance policies that limit our credit exposure to customers and liquidity reserves held against this risk exposure.

Liquidity Risk Management Framework

The
primary goal of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework is to ensure that we have access to adequate funding across a wide range of market conditions and time horizons. The framework is designed to enable us to fulfill our financial obligations and
support the execution of our business strategies.

The following principles guide our Liquidity Risk Management Framework:

•

Sufficient liquid assets should be maintained to cover maturing liabilities and other planned and contingent
outflows;

•

Maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned, with limited reliance on short-term funding;

•

Source, counterparty, currency, region and term of funding should be diversified; and

•

Liquidity Stress Tests should anticipate, and account for, periods of limited access to funding.

The core components of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity Stress
Tests and the Global Liquidity Reserve (as defined below), which support our target liquidity profile.

Required Liquidity Framework

Our Required Liquidity Framework reflects the amount of liquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed environments to ensure that our
financial condition and overall soundness are not adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet our financial obligations in a timely manner. The Required Liquidity Framework considers the most constraining liquidity
requirement to satisfy all regulatory and internal limits at a consolidated and legal entity level.

Liquidity Stress Tests

We use Liquidity Stress Tests to model external and intercompany liquidity flows across multiple scenarios and a range of time horizons. These
scenarios contain various combinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of different severity and duration. The methodology, implementation, production and analysis of our Liquidity Stress Tests are important components of the Required
Liquidity Framework.

The scenarios or assumptions used by us in our Liquidity Stress Tests include, but are not limited to, the
following:

•

No government support;

•

No access to equity and unsecured debt markets;

•

Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress horizon;

•

Higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of secured funding;

•

Additional collateral that would be required by trading counterparties, certain exchanges and clearing
organizations related to credit rating downgrades;

•

Additional collateral that would be required due to collateral substitutions, collateral disputes and uncalled
collateral;

•

Discretionary unsecured debt buybacks;

•

Drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third parties;


December 2016 Form 10-K


Management’s Discussion and Analysis

•

Client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short positions that fund long positions;

•

Limited access to the foreign exchange swap markets; and

•

Maturity

roll-off

of outstanding letters of credit with no further
issuance.

Liquidity Stress Tests are produced for the Parent Company and major operating subsidiaries, as well as at
major currency levels, to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability across the Firm, including a limited number of asset sales in a stressed environment. The Liquidity Stress Tests assume that subsidiaries will use their own liquidity
first to fund their obligations before drawing liquidity from the Parent Company and that the Parent Company will support its subsidiaries and will not have access to subsidiaries’ liquidity reserves. In addition to the assumptions underpinning
the Liquidity Stress Tests, we take into consideration settlement risk related to intraday settlement and clearing of securities and financing activities.

At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding
obligations as modeled in our Liquidity Stress Tests.

Global Liquidity Reserve

We maintain sufficient liquidity reserves to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the Required Liquidity
Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests. The size of the Global Liquidity Reserve is actively managed by us considering the following components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a stressed
environment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and collateral requirements. In addition, our Global Liquidity Reserve includes a discretionary surplus based on
risk tolerance and is subject to change dependent on market and Firm-specific events. The Global Liquidity Reserve is held within the Parent Company and its major operating subsidiaries.

Regulatory Liquidity Framework

Liquidity Coverage Ratio

The
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (“Basel Committee”) Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) standard is designed to ensure that banking organizations have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover net cash outflows
arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days. The standard’s objective is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations.

We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are subject to the LCR requirements issued by U.S. banking regulators (“U.S. LCR”), which are
based on the Basel Committee’s LCR, including a requirement to calculate each entity’s U.S. LCR on each business day. As of January 1, 2017, we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum of 100% of the fully

phased-in

U.S. LCR. In addition, effective April 1, 2017, we will be required to disclose certain quantitative and qualitative information related to our U.S. LCR calculation after each calendar quarter. We and
our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are compliant with the minimum required U.S. LCR based on current interpretations.

Net Stable Funding Ratio

The objective of the Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”) is to reduce funding risk over a

one-year

horizon by requiring banking organizations to fund their activities with sufficiently stable sources of funding in order to mitigate the risk of future funding stress.

December 2016 Form 10-K



Management’s Discussion and Analysis

The Basel Committee finalized the NSFR framework in 2014. In May 2016, the U.S. banking
regulators issued a proposal to implement the NSFR in the U.S. The proposal would require a covered company to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is measured with reference to sources of funding, including deposit and debt
liabilities, that is no less than the amount of its required stable funding, which is measured by applying standardized weightings to its assets, derivatives exposures and certain other items.

If adopted as proposed, the requirements would apply to us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries beginning January 1, 2018. We continue to
evaluate the potential impact of the proposal, which is subject to further rulemaking procedures following the closing of the public comment period. Our preliminary estimates, based on the current proposal, indicate that actions will be necessary to
meet the requirement, which we expect to accomplish by the effective date of the final rule. Our preliminary estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results based on the final rule to differ materially from estimates.
For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.

Funding Management

We manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversification of
secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed.

We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources may include our equity capital, long-term borrowings,
securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“repurchase agreements”), securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global
investors and currencies.

Secured Financing

A substantial portion of our total assets consist of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales
and trading activities in the Institutional Securities business. The liquid nature of these assets provides us with flexibility in managing the composition and size of our balance sheet. Our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and
unsecured financing. Secured financing investors principally focus on the quality of the eligible collateral posted. Accordingly, we actively manage the secured financing book based on the quality of the assets being funded.

We utilize shorter-term secured financing only for highly liquid assets and have established
longer tenor limits for less liquid asset classes, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption. We define highly liquid assets as government-issued or government-guaranteed securities with a high degree of fundability and
less liquid assets as those that do not meet these criteria. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the weighted average maturity of our secured financing of less liquid assets was greater than 120 days. To further minimize the
refinancing risk of secured financing for less liquid assets, we have established concentration limits to diversify our investor base and reduce the amount of monthly maturities for secured financing of less liquid assets. Furthermore, we obtain
term secured funding liabilities in excess of less liquid inventory as an additional risk mitigant to replace maturing trades in the event that secured financing markets, or our ability to access them, become limited. As a component of the Liquidity
Risk Management Framework, we hold a portion of our Global Liquidity Reserve against the potential disruption to our secured financing capabilities.

We also maintain a pool of liquid and easily fundable securities, which provide a valuable future source of liquidity. With the implementation
of liquidity standards, we have also incorporated high-quality liquid asset classifications that are consistent with the U.S. LCR definitions into our encumbrance reporting, which further substantiates the demonstrated liquidity characteristics of
the unencumbered asset pool and our ability to readily identify new funding sources for such assets.

Unsecured Financing

We view long-term debt and deposits as stable sources of funding. Unencumbered securities and

non-security

assets are financed with a combination of long-term and short-term debt and deposits. Our unsecured financings include structured borrowings, whose payments and redemption values are based on the
performance of certain underlying assets, including equity, credit, foreign exchange, interest rates and commodities. When appropriate, we may use derivative products to conduct asset and liability management and to make adjustments to our interest
rate and structured borrowings risk profile (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).

Deposits

Available funding sources to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries include demand deposit accounts, money market deposit accounts, time deposits,
repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. The vast majority of deposits in our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are


December 2016 Form 10-K


Management’s Discussion and Analysis

sourced from our retail brokerage accounts and are considered to have stable,

low-cost

funding characteristics. At December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, deposits were $155,863 million and $156,034 million, respectively (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).

Short-Term Borrowings

Our unsecured
short-term borrowings may primarily consist of structured notes, bank loans and bank notes with original maturities of 12 months or less. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had approximately $941 million and
$2,173 million, respectively, in short-term borrowings.

Long-Term Borrowings

We believe that accessing debt investors through multiple distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the unsecured markets. In
addition, the issuance of long-term borrowings allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments. Long-term borrowings are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize
investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types. Availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and
lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit.

We may engage in various transactions in the credit
markets (including, for example, debt retirements) that we believe are in our investors’ best interests.

Subsequent to December 31, 2016 and through February 21, 2017, long-term borrowings increased by
approximately $7.1 billion, net of maturities. This amount includes the issuances of senior debt; $7.0 billion on January 20, 2017 and $3.0 billion on February 17, 2017.

Trust Preferred Securities

During 2016, Morgan Stanley Capital Trust III, Morgan Stanley Capital Trust IV, Morgan Stanley Capital Trust V and Morgan Stanley Capital
Trust VIII redeemed all of their issued and outstanding Capital Securities pursuant to the

optional redemption provisions provided in the respective governing documents. In the aggregate, $2.8 billion was redeemed. We concurrently redeemed the related underlying junior
subordinated debentures.

For further information on long-term borrowings, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

Credit Ratings

We rely on external
sources to finance a significant portion of our

day-to-day

operations. The cost and availability of financing generally are impacted by our credit ratings, among other
things. In addition, our credit ratings can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as OTC derivative transactions, including credit
derivatives and interest rate swaps. Rating agencies consider company-specific factors; other industry factors such as regulatory or legislative changes and the macroeconomic environment, among other things.

Our credit ratings do not include any uplift from perceived government support from any rating agency given the significant progress of the
U.S. financial reform legislation and regulations. Meanwhile, some rating agencies have stated that they currently incorporate various degrees of credit rating uplift from

non-governmental

third-party sources
of potential support.

event of a future credit rating downgrade irrespective of whether we are in a net asset or net liability position.

The additional
collateral or termination payments that may be called in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and

can be based on ratings by either or both of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and
Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings (“S&P”). The following table shows the future potential collateral amounts and termination payments that could be called or required by counterparties or exchanges and clearing

While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions,
the impact it would have on our business and results of operations in future periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors, including, among others, the magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative
to peers, the rating assigned by the relevant agency

pre-downgrade,

individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we might take. The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is
included in our Liquidity Stress Tests.

Capital Management

We view capital as an important source of financial strength and actively manage our consolidated capital position based upon, among other
things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and, therefore, in the future may expand or contract our capital base to
address the changing needs of our businesses. We attempt to maintain total capital, on a consolidated basis, at least equal to the sum of our operating subsidiaries’ required equity.

Common Stock

We repurchased approximately $3,500 million of our outstanding common stock as part of our share repurchase program during 2016 and
$2,125 million during 2015 (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). Pursuant to the share repurchase program, we consider, among other things, business segment capital needs, as well as stock-based compensation and
benefit plan requirements. Share repurchases under our program will be exercised from time to time at prices we deem appropriate subject to various factors, including our capital position and market conditions. The share repurchases may be effected
through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule

10b5-1

plans, and may be suspended at any time. Share repurchases by us are subject to regulatory approval (see
“Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 5).

The Board determines the declaration and payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. On January 17, 2017, we announced that the Board
declared a quarterly dividend per common share of $0.20. The dividend was paid on February 15, 2017 to common shareholders of record on January 31, 2017.

(net of related issuance costs) resulted in proceeds of approximately $969 million.

Regulatory Requirements

Regulatory Capital Framework

We
are a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”), and are subject to the regulation and oversight of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal
Reserve”). The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for us, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates our compliance with such capital requirements. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”)
establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. The regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisions
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”).

The Basel Committee has recently
published revisions to certain standards in its capital framework, including with respect to counterparty credit risk exposures in derivatives transactions, market risk, interest rate risk in the banking book, and securitization capital standards,
although these revisions have not yet been adopted by the U.S. banking agencies. In addition, the Basel Committee is actively considering other potential revisions to other capital standards that would substantially change the framework. The impact
on us of any revisions to the Basel Committee’s capital standards could be substantial but is uncertain and depends on future rulemakings by the U.S. banking
agencies.

December 2016 Form 10-K



Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Regulatory Capital Requirements

We are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage capital ratios under the regulatory capital requirements. A summary of the
calculations of regulatory capital, risk-weighted assets (“RWAs”) and transition provisions follows.

Regulatory
Capital.

Minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital. Certain adjustments to and deductions from capital are required for purposes of determining these ratios,
such as goodwill, intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, other amounts in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) and investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions. Certain of these
adjustments and deductions are also subject to transitional provisions.

In addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements,
on a fully

phased-in

basis by 2019, we will be subject to:

•

A greater than 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer;

•

The Common Equity Tier 1 global systemically important bank

(“G-SIB”)

capital surcharge, currently at 3%; and

•

Up to a 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 countercyclical capital buffer (“CCyB”), currently set by banking
regulators at zero (collectively, the “buffers”).

In 2017, the

phase-in

amount for each of the buffers is 50% of the fully

phased-in

buffer requirement. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to
make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to

executive officers. For a further discussion of the

G-SIB

capital surcharge, see

“G-SIB

Capital
Surcharge” herein.

Risk-Weighted Assets.

RWAs reflect both our

on-

and

off-balance

sheet risk as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following:

•

Credit risk: The failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to us;

•

Market risk: Adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities,
correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and

•

Operational risk: Inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or from external events
(

e.g.

, fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets).

For a further
discussion of our market, credit and operational risks, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Item 7A.

Our binding risk-based capital ratios for regulatory purposes are the lower of the capital ratios computed under (i) the standardized
approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk RWAs (the “Standardized Approach”) and (ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs (the “Advanced
Approach”). At December 31, 2016, our binding ratios are based on the Advanced Approach transitional rules.

The methods for
calculating each of our risk-based capital ratios will change through January 1, 2022 as aspects of the capital rules are phased in. These changes may result in differences in our reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the next
that are independent of changes to our capital base, asset composition,

off-balance

sheet exposures or risk profile.

Adjusted average assets represent the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio and are composed of the average daily
balance of consolidated

deferred tax assets, certain investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions and other adjustments.

2.

The minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement is 4.0%.

The fully

phased-in

pro forma estimates in the previous
tables are based on our current understanding of the capital rules and other factors, which may be subject to change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance from the Federal Reserve and as the interpretation of the
regulations evolves over time. These fully

phased-in

pro forma estimates are

non-GAAP

financial measures that we consider to be useful measures for us, investors and
analysts in evaluating compliance with new regulatory capital requirements that were not yet effective at December 31, 2016. These preliminary estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially
and should not be taken as a projection of what our capital, capital ratios, RWAs, earnings or other results will actually be at future dates. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results, see “Risk
Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.

For us to remain a financial holding company, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must qualify as well-capitalized by
maintaining the minimum ratio requirements set forth in the previous table. The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for financial holding companies to reflect the higher capital standards required for us under the
capital rules. Assuming that the Federal Reserve would apply the same or very similar well-capitalized standards to financial holding companies, each of our risk-based capital ratios and Tier 1 leverage ratio at December 31, 2016 would have
exceeded the revised well-capitalized standard. The Federal Reserve may require us to maintain risk- and leverage-based capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a financial
holding company’s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio

We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to publicly disclose our supplementary leverage ratios, which will become effective as a
capital standard on January 1, 2018. By January 1, 2018, we must also maintain a Tier 1 supplementary leverage capital buffer of at least 2% in addition to the 3% minimum supplementary leverage ratio (for a total of at least 5%), in order
to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividends and stock repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. In addition,

beginning in 2018, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of 6% to be considered well-capitalized.

including disallowed goodwill, transitional intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets and certain investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions.

Based on our current understanding of the rules and other factors, we estimate our pro forma fully

supplementary leverage ratio to be approximately 6.2% at December 31, 2016 and 5.8% at December 31, 2015. These estimates utilize a fully

period has ended.

G-SIB

Capital Surcharge

We and other U.S.

G-SIBs

are subject to a risk-based capital surcharge. A

G-SIB

must calculate its

G-SIB

capital surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. The first method considers the

G-SIB’s

size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability and complexity, which is generally consistent with the methodology developed by the Basel Committee (“Method
1”). The second method uses similar inputs, but replaces substitutability with the use of short-term wholesale funding (“Method 2”) and generally results in higher surcharges than the first method. The

G-SIB

capital surcharge must be satisfied using Common Equity Tier 1 capital and functions as an extension of the capital conservation buffer. Our current

G-SIB

surcharge is 3%. The surcharge is being phased in between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019, and the

phase-in

amount for 2017 is 50% of the applicable surcharge (see “Minimum Risk-Based
Capital Ratios: Transitional Provisions” herein).

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements

On December 15, 2016, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule for

top-tier

bank
holding companies of U.S.

G-SIBs

(“covered BHCs”), including the Parent Company, that establishes external TLAC, long-term debt (“LTD”) and clean holding company requirements. The final
rule contains various definitions and restrictions, such as requiring eligible LTD to be issued by the covered BHC and be unsecured, have a maturity of one year or more from the date of issuance and not have certain derivative-linked features,
typically associated with certain types of structured notes. Covered BHCs must comply with all requirements under the rule by January 1, 2019, which we expect to accomplish.

The main purpose of the Federal Reserve’s minimum external TLAC and LTD requirements is to ensure that covered BHCs, including the Parent
Company, will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC where a single point of entry
(“SPOE”) resolution strategy is used (see “Business—Supervision and Regulation—Financial Holding Company—Resolution and Recovery Planning” in Part I, Item 1 and “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and
Compliance Risk” in Part I, Item 1A).

Under the final rule, a covered BHC is required to maintain minimum external TLAC equal to the
greater of 18% of total RWAs and 7.5% of its total leverage exposure (the denominator of its supplementary leverage ratio). In addition, covered BHCs must meet a separate external LTD requirement equal to the greater of 6% of total RWAs plus the

greater of the Method 1 and Method 2

G-SIB

capital surcharge applicable to the Parent Company and 4.5% of its total leverage exposure.

In addition, the final rule imposes TLAC buffer requirements on top of both the risk-based and leverage-exposure-based external TLAC minimum
requirements. The risk-based TLAC buffer is equal to the sum of 2.5%, the covered BHC’s Method 1

G-SIB

surcharge and the countercyclical capital buffer, if any, as a percentage of total RWAs. The
leverage-exposure-based TLAC buffer is equal to 2% of the covered BHC’s total leverage exposure. Failure to maintain the TLAC buffers would result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.

The final rule provides permanent grandfathering for debt instruments issued prior to December 31, 2016 that would be eligible LTD
but for having impermissible acceleration clauses or being governed by foreign law.

Furthermore, under the clean holding company
requirements of the final rule, a covered BHC is prohibited from incurring any external short-term debt or certain other liabilities, regardless of whether the liabilities are fully secured or otherwise senior to eligible LTD, or entering into
certain other prohibited transactions. Certain other external liabilities, including structured notes, are subject to a cap equal to 5% of the covered BHC’s outstanding external TLAC amount.

Capital Plans and Stress Tests

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large bank holding
companies, including us, which form part of the Federal Reserve’s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) framework.

We must submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by us and the
Federal Reserve, so that the Federal Reserve may assess our systems and processes that incorporate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy.

The capital plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a
debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution (

i.e.

, payments of dividends or stock repurchases) and any similar action that the Federal Reserve determines could impact our consolidated capital. The capital plan must include a
discussion of how we will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, including the requirements that are phased in over the planning horizon, and serve as a source of strength to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under supervisory stress
scenarios. In

December 2016 Form 10-K



Management’s Discussion and Analysis

addition, the Federal Reserve has issued guidance setting out its heightened expectations for capital planning practices at certain large financial institutions, including us.

In November 2015, the Federal Reserve amended its capital plan and stress test rules to delay until 2017 the use of the supplementary leverage
ratio requirement, defer indefinitely the use of the Advanced Approach risk-based capital framework in capital planning and

company-run

stress tests, and incorporate the Tier 1 capital deductions for certain
investments in Volcker Rule covered funds into the pro forma minimum capital requirements for capital plan and stress testing purposes.

The capital plan rule requires that large bank holding companies receive no objection from the Federal Reserve before making a capital
distribution. In addition, even with an approved capital plan, the bank holding company must seek the approval of the Federal Reserve before making a capital distribution if, among other reasons, the bank holding company would not meet its
regulatory capital requirements after making the proposed capital distribution. A bank holding company’s ability to make capital distributions (other than scheduled payments on Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments) is also limited
if its net capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in its capital plan.

In addition, we must conduct semiannual

company-run

stress tests and are subject to an annual Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve.

On April 5, 2016, we submitted our 2016 CCAR capital plan, and summary results of the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests
were published by the Federal Reserve in June. We exceeded all stressed capital ratio minimum requirements in the Federal Reserve severely adverse scenario, and our quantitative capital results improved from our prior-year submission. In
June 2016, we received a conditional

non-objection

from the Federal Reserve to our 2016 capital plan (see “Capital Management” herein). On December 29, 2016, we resubmitted our capital plan, as
required by the Federal Reserve, to address weaknesses identified in our capital planning process.

Future capital distributions may be
restricted if these identified weaknesses are not satisfactorily addressed when the Federal Reserve reviews our resubmitted capital plan. Pursuant to the conditional

non-objection,

we are able to execute the
capital actions set forth in our 2016 capital plan, which included increasing our common stock dividend to $0.20 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2016 and executing share repurchases of $3.5 billion during the period July 1,
2016 through June 30, 2017. In addition, we submitted the results of our

mid-cycle

company-run

stress test to the

Federal Reserve on October 5, 2016, and we disclosed a summary of the results on October 31, 2016.

For the 2017 capital planning and stress test cycle, we are required to submit our capital plan and

company-run

stress test results to the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2017. We expect that the Federal Reserve will provide its response to our 2017 capital plan by June 30, 2017. The Federal Reserve is
expected to publish summary results of the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests of each large bank holding company, including us, by June 30, 2017. We are required to disclose a summary of the results of our

company-run

stress tests within 15 days of the date the Federal Reserve discloses the results of the supervisory stress tests. In addition, we must submit the results of our

mid-cycle

company-run

stress test to the Federal Reserve by October 5, 2017 and disclose a summary of the results between October 5, 2017 and November 4,
2017.

In January 2017, the Federal Reserve adopted revisions to the capital plan and stress test rules that, among other things, reduce
the

de minimis

threshold for additional capital distributions that a firm may make during a capital plan cycle without seeking the Federal Reserve’s prior approval. The final rule also establishes a “blackout period” beginning
in March of each year while the Federal Reserve is conducting CCAR reviews during which firms are not permitted to submit

de minimis

exception notices or prior approval requests for additional capital distributions. The Federal Reserve is
currently considering making further changes to CCAR requirements, which may increase minimum capital requirements for the Firm.

The
Dodd-Frank Act also requires each of our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to conduct an annual stress test. MSBNA and MSPBNA submitted their 2016 annual

company-run

stress tests to the OCC on April 5, 2016 and
published a summary of their stress test results on June 23, 2016. For the 2017 stress test cycle, MSBNA and MSPBNA must submit their 2017 annual

company-run

stress tests to the OCC by April 5, 2017
and publish the summary results between June 15, 2017 and July 15, 2017.

Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required
Capital Framework

Our required capital (“Required Capital”) estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, an
internal capital adequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated by the Required Capital framework, as well as each business segment’s relative contribution to our total Required
Capital. Required Capital is assessed for each business segment and further attributed to product lines. This process is intended to align capital with the


December 2016 Form 10-K


Management’s Discussion and Analysis

risks in each business segment in order to allow senior management to evaluate returns on a risk-adjusted basis.

The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage

use-of-capital

measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from
stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. We define the difference between our total average common equity and the sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as Parent Company equity. We generally hold
Parent Company equity for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth, acquisitions and other capital needs.

Effective
January 1, 2016, the common equity estimation and attribution to the business segments are based on our pro forma fully

phased-in

regulatory capital, including supplementary leverage and stress losses
(which results in more capital being attributed to the business segments), whereas prior periods were attributed based on transitional regulatory capital provisions. Also, beginning in 2016, the amount of capital allocated to the business segments
will be set at the beginning of each year and will remain fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset. Differences between available and Required Capital will be attributed to Parent Company equity during the year. Periods prior to 2016
have not been recast under this new methodology.

The Required Capital framework is expected to evolve over time in response to changes in
the business and regulatory environment, for example, to incorporate stress testing or enhancements in modeling techniques. We will continue to evaluate the framework with respect to the impact of future regulatory requirements, as appropriate.

Regulatory
Developments

Resolution and Recovery Planning

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to submit to the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(“FDIC”) an annual resolution plan that

describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure.

Our preferred resolution strategy, which is set out in our 2015 resolution plan, is an SPOE strategy. On September 30, 2016, we submitted
a status report to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC in respect of certain shortcomings identified in our 2015 resolution plan. Pursuant to the status report, we indicated that the Parent Company will amend and restate its support agreement with its
material subsidiaries that is designed to ensure that such subsidiaries have sufficient capital and liquidity as and when needed throughout a resolution scenario.

Under the amended and restated support agreement, upon the occurrence of a resolution scenario, the Parent Company will be obligated to
contribute or loan on a subordinated basis all of its material assets, other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company and certain intercompany receivables, to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our material subsidiaries.

The obligations of the Parent Company under the amended and restated support agreement will be secured on a senior basis by the assets of the
Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company). As a result, claims of our material subsidiaries against the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company) will be effectively senior
to unsecured obligations of the Parent Company.

Our next full resolution plan submission will be on July 1, 2017. If the Federal
Reserve and the FDIC were to jointly determine that our 2017 resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution, and if we were unable to address any deficiencies identified by the regulators, we or any of our subsidiaries
may be subject to more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations, or, after a

two-year

period, we may be required to divest assets or
operations.

In September 2016, the OCC issued final guidelines that establish enforceable standards for recovery planning by national
banks and certain other institutions with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, calculated on a rolling four-quarter average basis, including MSBNA. The guidelines were effective on January 1, 2017, and MSBNA must be in
compliance by January 1, 2018.

In May 2016, the Federal Reserve proposed a rule that would impose contractual requirements on
certain “qualified financial contracts” (“covered QFCs”) to which U.S.

G-SIBs,

December 2016 Form 10-K



Management’s Discussion and Analysis

including us, and their subsidiaries are parties. In August 2016, the OCC proposed a rule that would subject national banks that are subsidiaries of U.S.

G-SIBs,

including our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, as well as certain other institutions (collectively with U.S.

G-SIBs

and their other subsidiaries, “covered
entities”), to substantively identical requirements.

Under the proposals, covered QFCs must expressly provide that transfer
restrictions and default rights against a covered entity are limited to the same extent as provided under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act and their implementing regulations. In addition, covered QFCs may not
permit the exercise of cross-default rights against a covered entity based on an affiliate’s entry into insolvency, resolution or similar proceedings. If adopted as proposed, the requirements would take effect at the start of the first calendar
quarter that begins at least one year after the final rules are issued. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposals, which are subject to public comment and further rulemaking procedures.

For more information about resolution and recovery planning requirements and our activities in these areas, see
“Business—Supervision and Regulation—Financial Holding Company—Resolution and Recovery Planning” in Part I, Item 1.

Legacy Covered Funds under the Volcker Rule

The Volcker Rule prohibits “banking entities,” including us and our affiliates, from engaging in certain “proprietary
trading” activities, as defined in the Volcker Rule, subject to exemptions for underwriting, market-making-related activities, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. The Volcker Rule also prohibits certain investments and
relationships by banking entities with “covered funds,” with a number of exemptions and exclusions.

Banking entities were
required to bring all of their activities and investments into conformance with the Volcker Rule by July 21, 2015, subject to certain extensions. The Federal Reserve has extended the conformance period until July 21, 2017 for investments
in, and relationships with, covered funds that were in place before December 31, 2013, referred to as “legacy covered funds.” The Volcker Rule also permits the Federal Reserve to provide an additional transition period of up to five
years for banking entities to conform investments in certain legacy covered funds that are also illiquid funds.

On December 12, 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a policy statement with information about
how banking entities may seek this further statutory extension. Additionally, the Federal Reserve stated that it expects the illiquid funds of banking entities to generally qualify for extensions, although they may not be granted if the banking
entity has not demonstrated meaningful progress to conform or divest its illiquid funds, or has a deficient compliance program under the Volcker Rule, or if the Federal Reserve has concerns about evasion. We submitted our application for illiquid
funds extension in January 2017, covering essentially all of our approximately $1.9 billion of

non-conforming

investments in, and relationships with, legacy covered funds subject to the Volcker Rule.

Off-Balance

Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

Off-Balance

Sheet Arrangements

We enter into various

off-balance

sheet arrangements, including through unconsolidated special purpose
entities (“SPEs”) and lending-related financial instruments (

e.g.

, guarantees and commitments), primarily in connection with the Institutional Securities and Investment Management business segments.

We utilize SPEs primarily in connection with securitization activities. For information on our securitization activities, see Note 13 to the
consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

For information on our commitments, obligations under certain guarantee arrangements and
indemnities, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. For further information on our lending commitments, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management—Credit Risk—Lending
Activities” in Item 7A.

Contractual Obligations

In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations
include long-term borrowings, other secured financings, contractual interest payments, contractual payments on time deposits, operating leases and purchase obligations.

instruments that exceed the impact on the value of our liabilities, it may adversely affect our financial position and profitability. Rising inflation may also result in increases in our

non-interest

expenses
that may not be readily recoverable in higher prices of services offered. Other changes in the interest rate environment and related volatility as well as expectations about the level of future interest rates could also impact our results of
operations.

A significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange
rates relative to the U.S. dollar, therefore, can affect the value of

non-U.S.

dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely
monitored, and, where cost-justified, strategies are adopted that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on our financial performance. These strategies may include the financing of

non-U.S.

dollar assets with direct or swap-based borrowings in the same currency and the use of currency forward contracts or the spot market in various hedging transactions related to net assets, revenues, expenses or cash flows. For information about
cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Risk Management

Overview

Management believes effective
risk management is vital to the success of our business activities. Accordingly, we have established an enterprise risk management (“ERM”) framework to integrate the diverse roles of risk management into a holistic enterprise structure and
to facilitate the incorporation of risk assessment into decision-making processes across the Firm. Risk is an inherent part of our businesses and activities. We have policies and procedures in place to identify, measure, monitor, advise, challenge
and control the principal risks involved in the activities of the Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, as well as at the Parent Company level. The principal risks involved in our business
activities include market (including

non-trading

interest rate risk), credit, operational, liquidity, model, compliance, strategic and reputational risk. Strategic risk is integrated into our business
planning, embedded in the evaluation of all principal risks and overseen by our Board of Directors (the “Board”).

The
cornerstone of our risk management philosophy is the pursuit of risk-adjusted returns through prudent risk taking that protects our capital base and franchise. This philosophy is implemented through the ERM framework. Five key principles underlie
this philosophy: integrity, comprehensiveness, independence, accountability and transparency. To help ensure the efficacy of risk management, which is an essential component of our reputation, senior management requires thorough and frequent
communication and the appropriate escalation of risk matters. The fast-paced, complex and constantly evolving nature of global financial markets

requires us to maintain a risk management culture that is incisive, knowledgeable about specialized products and markets, and subject to ongoing review and enhancement.

Our risk appetite defines the types of risk that the Firm is willing to accept in pursuit of our strategic objectives and business plan,
taking into account the interest of clients and fiduciary duties to shareholders, as well as capital and other regulatory requirements. This risk appetite is embedded in our risk culture and linked to our short-term and long-term strategic, capital
and financial plans, as well as compensation programs. This risk appetite and the related Board-level risk limits and risk tolerance statements are reviewed and approved by the Risk Committee of the Board (“BRC”), and the Board on, at
least, an annual basis.

Risk Governance Structure

Risk management at the Firm requires independent Firm-level oversight, accountability of our business divisions, and effective communication
of risk matters across the Firm, to senior management and ultimately to the Board. Our risk governance structure is composed of the Board; the BRC, the Audit Committee of the Board (“BAC”), and the Operations and Technology Committee of
the Board (“BOTC”); the Firm Risk Committee (“FRC”); the functional risk and control committees; senior management oversight (including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer
and Chief Compliance Officer); the Internal Audit Department and risk managers, committees, and groups within and across the business segments and operating legal entities. The ERM framework, composed of independent but complementary entities,
facilitates efficient and comprehensive supervision of our risk exposures and processes.

risk exposures of the Firm, including information security and cybersecurity risks, and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures; and oversees our business continuity
planning. The BOTC reports to the entire Board on a regular basis.

Firm Risk Committee.

The Board has also
authorized the FRC, a management committee appointed and chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, which includes the most senior officers of the Firm, including the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to oversee the
global ERM framework. The FRC’s responsibilities include oversight of our risk management principles, procedures and limits and the monitoring of capital levels and material market, credit, operational, model, liquidity, legal, compliance and
reputational risk matters, and other risks, as appropriate, and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage such risks. The FRC also establishes and communicates risk tolerance, including aggregate Firm limits and tolerance, as appropriate.
The Governance Process Review Subcommittee of the FRC oversees governance and process issues on behalf of the FRC. The FRC reports to the entire Board, the BAC, the BOTC and the BRC through the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief
Legal Officer.

Functional Risk and Control Committees.

Functional risk and control committees comprising
the ERM framework, including the Firm Credit Risk Committee, the Operational Risk Oversight Committee, the Asset/Liability Management Committee, the Global Compliance Committee, the Technology Governance Committee and the Firm Franchise Committee,
facilitate efficient and comprehensive supervision of our risk exposures and processes. The Strategic Transactions Committee reviews large strategic transactions and principal investments for the Firm; the CCAR Committee and oversee our
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing; our RRP Committee oversees our Title I Resolution Plan and Recovery Plan; the Global Legal Entity Oversight and Governance Committee monitors the governance framework that
operates over our consolidated legal entity population; the Enterprise Regulatory Oversight Committee oversees significant regulatory and supervisory requirements and assessments; various commitment and underwriting committees are responsible for
reviewing capital, lending and underwriting commitments on behalf of us; and the Culture, Values and Conduct Committee oversees Firm-wide standards and initiatives relating to culture, values and conduct, including training and enhancements to
performance and compensation processes.

In addition, each business segment has a risk committee that is responsible for helping to ensure
that the business segment, as applicable, adheres to established limits for market, credit, operational and other risks; implements risk measurement, monitoring, and management policies, procedures, controls and

systems that are consistent with the risk framework established by the FRC; and reviews, on a periodic basis, our aggregate risk exposures, risk exception experience, and the efficacy of our risk
identification, measurement, monitoring and management policies and procedures, and related controls.

Chief Risk
Officer.

The Chief Risk Officer, who is independent of business units, reports to the BRC and the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Risk Officer oversees compliance with our risk limits; approves exceptions to our risk
limits; independently reviews material market, credit, liquidity, model and operational risks; and reviews results of risk management processes with the Board, the BRC and the BAC, as appropriate. The Chief Risk Officer also coordinates with the
Chief Financial Officer regarding capital and liquidity management and works with the Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee of the Board to help ensure that the structure and design of incentive compensation arrangements do
not encourage unnecessary and excessive risk taking.

Independent Risk Management Functions.

The independent
risk management functions (Market Risk, Credit Risk, Operational Risk, Model Risk and Liquidity Risk Management Departments) are independent of our business units. These functions assist senior management and the FRC in monitoring and controlling
our risk through a number of control processes. Each function maintains its own risk governance structure with specified individuals and committees responsible for aspects of managing risk. Further discussion about the responsibilities of the risk
management functions may be found below under “Market Risk,” “Credit Risk,” “Operational Risk,” “Model Risk,” and “Liquidity Risk.”

Support and Control Groups.

Our support and control groups include the Legal and Compliance Division, the
Finance Division, the Operations Division, the Technology and Data Division, the Human Resources Department, Strategy and Execution, and Corporate Services. Our support and control groups coordinate with the business segment control groups to review
the risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to, among other things, controls over financial reporting and disclosure; the business segment’s market, credit and operational risk profile; liquidity risks; model risks;
sales practices; reputational, legal enforceability, compliance and regulatory risk; and technological risks. Participation by the senior officers of the Firm and business segment control groups helps ensure that risk policies and procedures,
exceptions to risk limits, new products and business ventures, and transactions with risk elements undergo thorough review.

Internal

management processes using a risk-based audit coverage model and audit execution methodology developed from professional auditing standards. The Internal Audit Department also reviews and tests
our compliance with internal guidelines set for risk management and risk monitoring, as well as external rules and regulations governing the industry. It effects these responsibilities through periodic reviews (with specified minimum frequency) of
our processes, activities, products or information systems; targeted reviews of specific controls and activities;

pre-implementation

or initiative reviews of new or significantly changed processes, activities,
products or information systems; and special investigations required as a result of internal factors or regulatory requests. In addition to regular reports to the BAC, the Global Audit Director also periodically reports to the BRC and BOTC on
risk-related controls.

Culture, Values and Conduct of Employees.

Employees of the Firm are accountable for
conducting themselves in accordance with our core values:

Putting Clients First, Doing the Right Thing, Leading with Exceptional Ideas and Giving Back

. We are committed to building on our strong culture anchored in these core values, and
supported by our governance framework, Board and management oversight, effective risk management and controls, training and development programs, policies, procedures, and defined roles and responsibilities, including the role of the Culture, Values
and Conduct Committee. Our Code of Conduct (the “Code”) establishes standards for employee conduct that further reinforce the Firm’s commitment to integrity and ethical conduct. Every new hire and every employee annually must
certify to their understanding of and adherence to the Code. The employee annual review process includes evaluation of adherence to the Code and our core values. The Global Incentive Compensation Discretion Policy sets forth standards for managers
when making annual compensation decisions and specifically provides that managers must consider whether their employees effectively managed and/or supervised risk control practices during the performance year. We also have several mutually
reinforcing processes to identify employee conduct that may have an impact on employment status, current-year compensation and/or prior-year compensation. Our clawback and cancellation provisions, which permit recovery of deferred incentive
compensation, apply to a broad scope of employee conduct, including any act or omission that constitutes a breach of obligation to the Firm (including failure to comply with internal compliance, ethics or risk management standards, and failure or
refusal to perform duties satisfactorily, including supervisory and management duties), causes a restatement of our consolidated financial results, constitutes a violation of our global risk management principles, policies and standards, or causes a
loss of revenues associated with a position on which the employee was paid and the employee operated outside of internal control policies.

Risk Management Process

The following is a discussion of our risk management policies and procedures for our principal risks (capital and liquidity risk is discussed
in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7). The discussion focuses on our securities activities (primarily our institutional trading
activities) and corporate lending and related activities. We believe that these activities generate a substantial portion of our principal risks. This discussion and the estimated amounts of our risk exposure generated by our statistical analyses
are forward-looking statements. However, the analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of future events, and actual results may vary significantly from such analyses due to events in the markets in which we operate and certain other
factors described below.

Risk Limits Framework

Risk limits and quantitative metrics provide the basis for monitoring risk-taking activity and avoiding outsized risk-taking. Our risk-taking
capacity is sized through the Firm’s capital planning process where losses are estimated under the Firm’s Bank Holding Company Severely Adverse stress testing scenario. We also maintain a comprehensive suite of risk limits and quantitative
metrics to support and implement our risk appetite statement. Our risk limits support linkages between the overall risk appetite, which is reviewed by the Board, and more granular risk-taking decisions and activities.

Risk limits, once established, are reviewed and updated on at least an annual basis, with more frequent updates as necessary. Board-level risk
limits address the most important Firm-wide aggregations of risk, including, but not limited to, stressed market, credit and liquidity risks. Additional risk limits approved by the FRC address more specific types of risk and are bound by the
higher-level Board risk limits.

Market Risk

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities (the price
volatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices), correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we incur market risk as a result of trading, investing
and client facilitation activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business segment where the substantial majority of our

Value-at-Risk

(“VaR”) for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, we incur trading-related market risk within the Wealth Management business segment. The Investment Management business segment primarily incurs

non-trading

market risk from capital investments in real estate funds and investments in private equity

vehicles. Market risk includes

non-trading

interest rate risk.

Non-trading

interest rate risk in the banking book
(amounts classified for regulatory capital purposes under the banking book regime) refers to the exposure that a change in interest rates will result in prospective earnings changes for assets and liabilities in the banking book.

Sound market risk management is an integral part of our culture. The various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring
that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. The control groups help ensure that these risks are measured and closely monitored and are made transparent to senior management. The Market Risk Department is responsible for ensuring
transparency of material market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. To execute these responsibilities, the Market Risk Department monitors our risk against limits
on aggregate risk exposures, performs a variety of risk analyses, routinely reports risk summaries, and maintains our VaR and scenario analysis systems. These limits are designed to control price and market liquidity risk. Market risk is also
monitored through various measures: by use of statistics (including VaR and related analytical measures); by measures of position sensitivity; and through routine stress testing, which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios of
specified changes in market factors, and scenario analyses conducted by the Market Risk Department in collaboration with the business units. The material risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the Market Risk
Department that are circulated to and discussed with senior management, the FRC, the BRC and the Board.

The Chief Risk Officer, among
other things, monitors market risk through the Market Risk Department, which reports to the Chief Risk Officer and is independent of the business units, and has close interactions with senior management and the risk management control groups in the
business units. The Chief Risk Officer is a member of the FRC, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, which includes the most senior officers of the Firm, and regularly reports on market risk matters to this committee, as well as to the BRC
and the Board.

Sales and Trading and Related Activities

Primary Market Risk Exposures and Market Risk Management.

During 2016, we had exposures to a wide range of
interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices—and the associated implied volatilities and spreads—related to the global markets in which we conduct our trading activities.

We are exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a result of our market-making activities and other trading in

interest rate-sensitive financial instruments (

e.g

., risk arising from changes in the level or implied volatility of interest rates, the timing of mortgage prepayments, the shape of the
yield curve and credit spreads). The activities from which those exposures arise and the markets in which we are active include, but are not limited to, the following: corporate and government debt across both developed and emerging markets and
asset-backed debt (including mortgage-related securities).

We are exposed to equity price and implied volatility risk as a result of
making markets in equity securities and derivatives and maintaining other positions (including positions in

non-public

entities). Positions in

non-public

entities may
include, but are not limited to, exposures to private equity, venture capital, private partnerships, real estate funds and other funds. Such positions are less liquid, have longer investment horizons and are more difficult to hedge than listed
equities.

We are exposed to foreign exchange rate and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in foreign currencies and
foreign currency derivatives, from maintaining foreign exchange positions and from holding

non-U.S.

dollar-denominated financial instruments.

We are exposed to commodity price and implied volatility risk as a result of market-making activities in commodity products related primarily
to electricity, natural gas, oil and precious metals. Commodity exposures are subject to periods of high price volatility as a result of changes in supply and demand. These changes can be caused by weather conditions; physical production and
transportation; or geopolitical and other events that affect the available supply and level of demand for these commodities.

We manage
our trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies. These strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial
instruments, including a variety of derivative products (

e.g

., futures, forwards, swaps and options). Hedging activities may not always provide effective mitigation against trading losses due to differences in the terms, specific
characteristics or other basis risks that may exist between the hedge instrument and the risk exposure that is being hedged. We manage the market risk associated with our trading activities on a Firm-wide basis, on a worldwide trading division level
and on an individual product basis. We manage and monitor our market risk exposures in such a way as to maintain a portfolio that we believe is well-diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflects our aggregate
risk tolerance as established by our senior management.


December 2016 Form 10-K


Risk Disclosures

Aggregate market risk limits have been approved for the Firm across all divisions worldwide.
Additional market risk limits are assigned to trading desks and, as appropriate, products and regions. Trading division risk managers, desk risk managers, traders and the Market Risk Department monitor market risk measures against limits in
accordance with policies set by our senior management.

VaR.

We use the statistical technique known
as VaR as one of the tools used to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of our trading portfolios. The Market Risk Department calculates and distributes daily

VaR-based

risk measures to
various levels of management.

VaR Methodology, Assumptions and Limitations.

We estimate VaR using a
model based on volatility-adjusted historical simulation for general market risk factors and Monte Carlo simulation for name-specific risk in corporate shares, bonds, loans and related derivatives. The model constructs a distribution of hypothetical
daily changes in the value of trading portfolios based on the following: historical observation of daily changes in key market indices or other market risk factors; and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio values to these market risk
factor changes. Our VaR model uses four years of historical data with a volatility adjustment to reflect current market conditions. VaR for risk management purposes (“Management VaR”) is computed at a 95% level of confidence over a

one-day

time horizon, which is a useful indicator of possible trading losses resulting from adverse daily market moves. The

95%/one-day

VaR corresponds to the unrealized loss
in portfolio value that, based on historically observed market risk factor movements, would have been exceeded with a frequency of 5%, or five times in every 100 trading days, if the portfolio were held constant for one day.

Our VaR model generally takes into account linear and

non-linear

exposures to equity and commodity
price risk, interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange rates. The model also takes into account linear exposures to implied volatility risks for all asset classes and

non-linear

exposures to
implied volatility risks for equity, commodity and foreign exchange referenced products. The VaR model also captures certain implied correlation risks associated with portfolio credit derivatives, as well as certain basis risks (

e.g.,

corporate debt and related credit derivatives).

We use VaR as one of a range of risk management tools. Among their benefits, VaR models
permit estimation of a portfolio’s aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating a range of varied market risks and portfolio assets. One key element of the VaR model is that it reflects risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or
hedging activities. However, VaR has various limitations, which include, but are not

limited to: use of historical changes in market risk factors, which may not be accurate predictors of future market conditions and may not fully incorporate the risk of extreme market events that
are outsized relative to observed historical market behavior or reflect the historical distribution of results beyond the 95% confidence interval; and reporting of losses in a single day, which does not reflect the risk of positions that cannot be
liquidated or hedged in one day. A small proportion of market risk generated by trading positions is not included in VaR. The modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions relies on approximations that, under certain circumstances, could
produce significantly different results from those produced using more precise measures. VaR is most appropriate as a risk measure for trading positions in liquid financial markets and will understate the risk associated with severe events, such as
periods of extreme illiquidity. We are aware of these and other limitations and, therefore, use VaR as only one component in our risk management oversight process. This process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses and extensive
risk monitoring, analysis and control at the trading desk, division and Firm levels.

Our VaR model evolves over time in response to
changes in the composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities. We are committed to continuous review and enhancement of VaR methodologies and assumptions in order to capture evolving risks
associated with changes in market structure and dynamics. As part of our regular process improvements, additional systematic and name-specific risk factors may be added to improve the VaR model’s ability to more accurately estimate risks to
specific asset classes or industry sectors.

Since the reported VaR statistics are estimates based on historical data, VaR should not be
viewed as predictive of our future revenues or financial performance or of our ability to monitor and manage risk. There can be no assurance that our actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the VaR amounts indicated below or that such
losses will not occur more than five times in 100 trading days for a

95%/one-day

VaR. VaR does not predict the magnitude of losses that, should they occur, may be significantly greater than the VaR amount.

VaR statistics are not readily comparable across firms because of differences in the firms’ portfolios, modeling assumptions and
methodologies. These differences can result in materially different VaR estimates across firms for similar portfolios. The impact of such differences varies depending on the factor history assumptions, the frequency with which the factor history is
updated and the confidence level. As a result, VaR statistics are more useful when interpreted as indicators of trends in a firm’s risk profile rather than as an absolute measure of risk to be compared across firms.

December 2016 Form 10-K



Risk Disclosures

We utilize the same VaR model for risk management purposes, as well as for regulatory capital
calculations. Our VaR model has been approved by our regulators for use in regulatory capital calculations.

The portfolio of positions
used for Management VaR differs from that used for regulatory capital requirements (“Regulatory VaR”), as Management VaR contains certain positions that are excluded from Regulatory VaR. Examples include counterparty credit valuation
adjustment (“CVA”) and related hedges, as well as loans that are carried at fair value and associated hedges.

The following
table presents the Management VaR for the Trading portfolio, on a

period-end,

annual average, and annual high and low basis. To further enhance the transparency of the traded market risk, the Credit Portfolio
VaR has been disclosed as a separate category from the Primary Risk Categories. The Credit Portfolio includes counterparty CVA and related hedges, as well as loans that are carried at fair value and associated hedges.

1.

Diversification benefit equals the difference between the total Management VaR and the sum of the component VaRs. This
benefit arises because the simulated

one-day

losses for each of the components occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each component.

2.

The high and low VaR values for the total Management VaR and each of the component VaRs might have occurred on different
days during the year, and therefore, the diversification benefit is not an applicable measure.

The average total Management VaR for 2016 was $43 million compared with $50 million
for 2015. The average Management VaR for the Primary Risk Categories for 2016 was $36 million compared with $47 million in 2015. The noted decreases were driven by an overall reduction in risk exposures across the Sales and Trading
businesses.

Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues for 2016.

One method of evaluating the
reasonableness of our VaR model as a measure of our potential volatility of net revenues is to compare VaR with actual trading revenues. Assuming no intraday trading, for a

95%/one-day

VaR, the expected number
of times that trading losses should exceed VaR during the year is 13, and, in general, if trading losses were to exceed VaR more than 21 times in a year, the adequacy of the VaR model would be questioned. We evaluate the reasonableness of our VaR
model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with actual trading results for the Firm, as well as individual business units. For days where losses exceed the VaR statistic, we examine the drivers of trading
losses to evaluate the VaR model’s accuracy relative to realized trading results.

The distribution of VaR Statistics and Net
Revenues is presented in the following histograms for the Total Trading populations.

Total
Trading.

As shown in the

95%/One-Day

Management VaR table on the preceding page, the average

95%/one-day

total Management VaR for 2016
was $43 million. The following histogram presents the distribution of the daily

95%/one-day

total Management VaR for 2016, which was in a range between $30 million and $60 million for
approximately 99% of trading days during the year.

The following histogram shows the distribution for 2016 of daily net trading revenues, including profits
and losses from Interest rate and credit spread, Equity price, Foreign exchange rate, Commodity price, and Credit Portfolio positions and intraday trading activities, for our Trading businesses. Daily net trading revenues also include intraday
trading activities but exclude certain items not captured in the VaR model, such as fees, commissions and net interest income. Daily net trading revenues

differ from the definition of revenues required for Regulatory VaR backtesting, which further excludes intraday trading. During 2016, we experienced net trading losses on 18 days, of which no day
was in excess of the

95%/one-day

Total Management VaR.

Non-Trading

Risks

We believe that sensitivity analysis is an appropriate representation of our

non-trading

risks.
Reflected below is this analysis covering substantially all of the

non-trading

risk in our portfolio.

Counterparty Exposure Related to Our Own Credit Spread.

The credit spread risk sensitivity of the
counterparty exposure related to our own credit spread corresponded to an increase in value of approximately $6 million for each 1 basis point widening in our credit spread level at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Funding Liabilities.

The credit spread risk sensitivity of our

mark-to-market

funding liabilities corresponded to an increase in value of approximately $17 million and $11 million for each 1 basis point widening in our credit spread level at December 31,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity.

The following table
presents an analysis of selected instantaneous upward and downward parallel interest rate shocks on net interest income over the next 12 months for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. These shocks are applied to our

12-month

forecast for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, which incorporates market expectations of interest rates and our forecasted business activity, including our deposit deployment strategy and asset-liability
management hedges.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, we changed the criteria used to determine the pricing for our deposit liabilities
to client cash balances from client assets under management. As a result of the change, the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries balance sheet is expected to have greater sensitivity to higher rates than in prior periods.

At December 31, 2016, the upward instantaneous interest rate shocks result in a positive impact to our

We do not manage to any single rate scenario but
rather manage net interest income in our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to optimize across a range of possible outcomes. The sensitivity analysis assumes that we take no action in response to these scenarios, assumes there are no changes in other
macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates, and includes subjective assumptions regarding customer and market re-pricing behavior and other factors.

Investments

.    We have exposure to public and private companies through direct investments, as well as through
funds that invest in these assets. These investments are predominantly equity positions with long investment horizons, a portion of which are for business facilitation purposes. The market risk related to these investments is measured by estimating
the potential reduction in net income associated with a 10% decline in investment values and related impact on performance fees.

Equity Market Sensitivity.

In the Wealth Management and Investment Management
business segments, certain

fee-based

revenue streams are driven by the value of clients’ equity holdings. The overall level of revenues for these streams also depends on multiple additional factors that
include, but are not limited to, the level and duration of the equity market decline, price volatility, the geographic and industry mix of client assets, the rate and magnitude of client investments and redemptions, and the impact of such market
decline and price volatility on client behavior. Therefore, overall revenues do not correlate completely with changes in the equity markets.

Risk Disclosures

Credit Risk

Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us. We
primarily incur credit risk exposure to institutions and individuals through our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments.

We may incur credit risk in our Institutional Securities business segment through a variety of activities, including, but not limited to, the
following:

•

extending credit to clients through various lending commitments;

•

entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments
to us;

•

providing short- or long-term funding that is secured by physical or financial collateral whose value may at
times be insufficient to fully cover the loan repayment amount;

•

posting margin and/or collateral to clearinghouses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks, securities firms and
other financial counterparties;

•

placing funds on deposit at other financial institutions to support our clearing and settlement obligations;
and

•

investing or trading in securities and loan pools, whereby the value of these assets may fluctuate based on
realized or expected defaults on the underlying obligations or loans.

We incur credit risk in our Wealth Management
business segment, primarily through lending to individuals and entities, including, but not limited to, the following:

•

margin loans collateralized by securities;

•

securities-based lending and other forms of secured loans, including tailored lending, to high net worth
clients; and

•

single-family residential mortgage loans in conforming,

non-conforming

or home equity lines of credit (“HELOC”) form, primarily to existing Wealth Management clients.

Monitoring and Control

In order to help protect us from losses, the Credit Risk Management Department establishes Firm-wide practices to evaluate,
monitor and control credit risk exposure at the transaction, obligor and portfolio levels. The Credit Risk Management Department approves extensions of credit, evaluates the creditworthiness of the counterparties and borrowers on a regular basis,
and ensures that credit exposure is actively monitored and managed. The evaluation of counterparties and

borrowers includes an assessment of the probability that an obligor will default on its financial obligations and any losses that may occur when an obligor defaults. In addition, credit risk
exposure is actively managed by credit professionals and committees within the Credit Risk Management Department and through various risk committees, whose membership includes individuals from the Credit Risk Management Department. A comprehensive
and global Credit Limits Framework is utilized to manage credit risk levels across the Firm. The Credit Limits Framework is calibrated within our risk tolerance and includes single-name limits and portfolio concentration limits by country, industry
and product type.

The Credit Risk Management Department ensures transparency of material credit risks, compliance with established limits
and escalation of risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. The Credit Risk Management Department also works closely with the Market Risk Department and applicable business units to monitor risk exposures and to perform stress tests to
identify, analyze and control credit risk concentrations arising in the lending and trading activities. The stress tests shock market factors (

e.g.

, interest rates, commodity prices, credit spreads), risk parameters

(e.g.

, default
probabilities and loss given default), recovery rates and expected losses in order to assess the impact of stresses on exposures, profit and loss, and our capital position. Stress and scenario tests are conducted in accordance with our established
policies and procedures.

Credit Evaluation

The evaluation of corporate and institutional counterparties and borrowers includes assigning obligor credit ratings, which reflect an
assessment of an obligor’s probability of default and loss given default. Credit evaluations typically involve the assessment of financial statements; leverage; liquidity; capital strength; asset composition and quality; market capitalization;
access to capital markets; adequacy of collateral, if applicable; and in the case of certain loans, cash flow projections and debt service requirements. The Credit Risk Management Department also evaluates strategy, market position, industry
dynamics, management and other factors that could affect the obligor’s risk profile. Additionally, the Credit Risk Management Department evaluates the relative position of our exposure in the borrower’s capital structure and relative
recovery prospects, as well as other structural elements of the particular transaction.

The evaluation of consumer borrowers is tailored
to the specific type of lending. Margin and securities-based loans are evaluated based on factors that include, but are not limited to, the amount of the loan, the degree of leverage and the quality, diversification, price volatility and liquidity
of the collateral. The underwriting of residential real estate loans includes, but is not limited to, review of the obligor’s income,


December 2016 Form 10-K


Risk Disclosures

net worth, liquidity, collateral,

loan-to-value

ratio and credit bureau information. Subsequent credit monitoring
for individual loans is performed at the portfolio level, and collateral values are monitored on an ongoing basis.

Credit risk metrics
assigned to our borrowers during the evaluation process are incorporated into the Credit Risk Management Department’s maintenance of the allowance for loan losses for the loans held for the investment portfolio. Such allowance serves as a
reserve for probable inherent losses, as well as probable losses related to loans identified for impairment. For more information on the allowance for loan losses, see Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

Risk Mitigation

We may seek to
mitigate credit risk from our lending and trading activities in multiple ways, including collateral provisions, guarantees and hedges. At the transaction level, we seek to mitigate risk through management of key risk elements such as size, tenor,
financial covenants, seniority and collateral. We actively hedge our lending and derivatives exposure through various financial instruments that may include single-name, portfolio and structured credit derivatives. Additionally, we may sell, assign
or syndicate loans and lending commitments to other financial institutions in the primary and secondary loan markets. In connection with our derivatives trading activities, we generally enter into master netting agreements and collateral
arrangements with counterparties. These agreements provide us with the ability to demand collateral, as well as to liquidate collateral and offset receivables and payables covered under the same master agreement in the event of a counterparty
default. A collateral management group monitors collateral levels against requirements and oversees the administration of the collateral function. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information about our
collateralized transactions.

Lending Activities

We provide loans and lending commitments to a variety of customers, from large corporate and institutional clients to high net worth
individuals. In addition, we purchase loans in the secondary market. In the consolidated balance sheets, these loans and lending commitments are carried at either fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings; held for investment, which
are recorded at amortized cost; or held for sale, which are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Loans held for investment and loans held for sale are classified in Loans, and loans held at fair value are classified in Trading assets in the
consolidated balance sheets. See Notes 3, 7 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.

Lending commitments represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for all
lending transactions. Since commitments associated with these business activities may expire unused or may not be utilized to full capacity, they do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.

4.

For syndications led by us, the lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed are net of the amounts
agreed to by counterparties that will participate in the syndication. For syndications that we participate in and do not lead, lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed include only the amount that we expect will be allocated
from the lead, syndicate bank. Due to the nature of our obligations under the commitments, these amounts include certain commitments participated to third parties.

Risk Disclosures

Our credit exposure from our loans and lending commitments is measured in accordance with our
internal risk management standards. Risk factors considered in determining the aggregate allowance for loan and commitment losses include the borrower’s financial strength, seniority of the loan, collateral type, volatility of collateral value,
debt cushion,

loan-to-value

ratio, debt service ratio, covenants and counterparty type. Qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions,
nature and volume of the portfolio and lending terms, and volume and severity of past due loans may also be considered.

At
December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses related to loans that were accounted for as held for investment was $274 million and $225 million, respectively, and the allowance for commitment losses
related to lending commitments that were accounted for as held for investment was $190 million and $185 million, respectively. The aggregate allowance for loan and commitment losses increased over the year ended December 31, 2016
primarily due to the energy sector. See “Institutional Securities Lending Exposures Related to the Energy Industry” herein and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.

Institutional Securities Lending Activities

.

In connection with certain of our
Institutional Securities business segment activities, we provide loans and lending commitments to a diverse group of corporate and other institutional clients. These activities include corporate lending, commercial and residential mortgage lending,
asset-backed lending, corporate loans purchased in the secondary market, financing extended to equities and commodities customers, and loans to municipalities. These loans and lending commitments may have varying terms; may be senior or
subordinated; may be secured or unsecured; are generally contingent upon representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower; and may be syndicated, traded or hedged by us.

We also participate in securitization activities whereby we extend short-term or long-term funding to clients through loans and lending
commitments that are secured by the assets of the borrower and generally provide for over-collateralization. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for information about our securitization activities.

Institutional Securities loans and lending commitments are mainly related to relationship-based and event-driven lending to select corporate
clients. Relationship-based loans and lending commitments are used for general corporate purposes, working capital and liquidity purposes by our investment banking clients and typically consist of revolving lines of credit, letter of credit
facilities and term loans. In

connection with the relationship-based lending activities, we had hedges (which included single-name, sector and index hedges) with a notional amount of $20.2 billion and $12.0 billion
at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Event-driven loans and lending commitments are associated with a particular event or transaction, such as to support client merger, acquisition, recapitalization and project finance
activities. Event-driven loans and lending commitments typically consist of revolving lines of credit, term loans and bridge loans.

Institutional Securities Lending Exposures Related to the Energy
Industry.

At December 31, 2016, Institutional Securities’ loans and lending commitments related to the energy industry were $11.8 billion, of which approximately

68% are accounted for as held for investment and 32% are accounted for as either held for sale or at fair value. Additionally, approximately 52% of the total energy industry loans and lending
commitments were to investment grade counterparties. At December 31, 2016, the energy industry portfolio included $1.3 billion in loans and $2.1 billion in lending commitments to Oil and Gas Exploration and Production
(“E&P”) companies.

The E&P loans were to

non-investment

grade counterparties,
which are generally subject to periodic borrowing base reassessments based on the value of the underlying oil and gas reserves pledged as collateral. In limited situations, we may extend the period related to borrowing base reassessments typically
in conjunction with taking certain risk mitigating actions with the borrower. Approximately 54% of the E&P lending commitments were to investment grade counterparties. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we increased the allowance for
loan and commitment losses on held for investment energy exposures and incurred

mark-to-market

losses related to energy loans and lending commitments. See “Credit
Risk—Lending Activities” herein for further information. To the extent commodities prices, or oil prices, remain at

year-end

levels, or deteriorate further, we may incur additional lending losses.

Institutional Securities Margin Lending.

In addition to the activities noted above, Institutional
Securities provides margin lending, which allows the client to borrow against the value of qualifying securities. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the amounts related to margin lending were $11.9 billion and
$10.6 billion, respectively, which were classified within Customer and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets.

Wealth Management Lending Activities.

The principal Wealth Management lending activities include
securities-based lending and residential real estate loans.

Securities-based lending provided to our retail clients is primarily
conducted through our Portfolio Loan Account (“PLA”) and Liquidity Access Line (“LAL”) platforms, which had an outstanding loan balance of $29.7 billion and $24.9 billion at December 31, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively. These loans allow the client to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities for any purpose other than purchasing securities. We establish approved credit lines against qualifying securities and
monitor limits daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, require customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce debt positions, when necessary. These credit lines are primarily uncommitted loan facilities, as we reserve the right
to not make any advances, or may terminate these credit lines at any time. Factors considered in the review of these loans include, but are not limited to, the loan amount, the client’s credit profile, the degree of leverage, collateral
diversification, price volatility and liquidity of the collateral.

December 2016 Form 10-K



Risk Disclosures

Residential real estate loans consist of first and second lien mortgages, including HELOC loans.
Our underwriting policy is designed to ensure that all borrowers pass an assessment of capacity and willingness to pay, which includes an analysis utilizing industry standard credit scoring models (

e.g.

, Fair Isaac Corporation
(“FICO”) scores), debt ratios and assets of the borrower.

Loan-to-value

ratios are determined based on independent third-party property appraisal/valuations,
and security lien position is established through title/ownership reports. The vast majority of mortgage and HELOC loans are held for investment in the Wealth Management business segment’s loan portfolio.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, loans and lending commitments associated with the Wealth Management business segment lending activities
increased by approximately 24%, mainly due to growth in LAL and residential real estate loans.

At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately 99.9% of the Wealth Management business segment
loans held for investment were current, while approximately 0.1% were on nonaccrual status because the loans were past due for a period of 90 days or more or payment of principal or interest was in doubt.

The Wealth Management business segment also provides margin lending to clients and had an outstanding balance of

$12.5 billion and $14.7 billion at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which were classified within Customer and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets.

In addition, the Wealth Management business segment has employee loans of $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion at December 31, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively, that are granted in conjunction with programs established by us to retain and recruit certain employees. These loans are recorded in Customer and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets. These loans are full
recourse, generally require periodic payments and have repayment terms ranging from 1 to 12 years. We establish an allowance for loan amounts we do not consider recoverable, which is recorded in Compensation and benefits expense.

Credit Exposure—Derivatives

We
incur credit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives. Credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract. In connection with our OTC derivative activities, we
generally enter into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties. These agreements provide us with the ability to demand collateral, as well as to liquidate collateral and offset receivables and payables covered under
the same master netting agreement in the event of counterparty default. We manage our trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies. These strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging activities
consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments, including a variety of derivative products (

e.g.

, futures, forwards, swaps and options). For credit exposure information on our OTC derivative
products, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

Credit Derivatives

.    A credit
derivative is a contract between a seller and buyer of protection against the risk of a credit event occurring on one or more debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity. The buyer typically pays a periodic premium over the life of the
contract and is protected for the period. If a credit event occurs, the seller is required to make payment to the beneficiary based on the terms of the credit derivative contract. Credit events, as defined in the contract, may be one or more of the
following defined events: bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay, obligation acceleration, repudiation, payment moratorium and restructurings.

We trade in a variety of credit derivatives and may either purchase or write protection on a single name or portfolio of referenced entities.
In transactions referencing a portfolio of entities or securities, protection may be limited to a tranche of

Risk Disclosures

exposure or a single name within the portfolio. We are an active market maker in the credit derivatives markets. As a market maker, we work to earn a

bid-offer

spread on client flow business and manage any residual credit or correlation risk on a portfolio basis. Further, we use credit derivatives to manage our exposure to residential and commercial
mortgage loans and corporate lending exposures. The effectiveness of our credit default swap (“CDS”) protection as a hedge of our exposures may vary depending upon a number of factors, including the contractual terms of the CDS.

We actively monitor our counterparty credit risk related to credit derivatives. A majority of our counterparties are composed of banks,
broker-dealers, insurance and other financial institutions. Contracts with these counterparties may include provisions related to counterparty rating downgrades, which may result in the counterparty posting additional collateral to us. As with all
derivative contracts, we consider counterparty credit risk in the valuation of our positions and recognize credit valuation adjustments as appropriate within Trading revenues in the consolidated income statements.

Country Risk Exposure

Country risk exposure is the risk that events in, or that affect, a foreign country (any country other than the U.S.) might adversely affect
us. We actively manage country risk exposure through a comprehensive risk management framework that combines credit and market fundamentals and allows us to effectively identify, monitor and limit country risk. Country risk exposure before and
after hedging is monitored and managed.

Our obligor credit evaluation process may also identify indirect exposures whereby an obligor has
vulnerability or exposure to another country or jurisdiction. Examples of indirect exposures include mutual funds that invest in a single country, offshore companies whose assets reside in another country to that of the offshore jurisdiction and
finance company subsidiaries of corporations. Indirect exposures identified through the credit evaluation process may result in a reclassification of country risk.

December 2016 Form 10-K



Risk Disclosures

We conduct periodic stress testing that seeks to measure the impact on our credit and market
exposures of shocks stemming from negative economic or political scenarios. When deemed appropriate by our risk managers, the stress test scenarios include possible contagion effects. Second order risks such as the impact for core European banks of
their peripheral exposures may also be considered. This analysis, and results of the stress tests, may result in the amendment of limits or exposure mitigation.

In addition to our country risk exposure, we disclose our cross-border risk exposure in “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data—Financial Data Supplement (Unaudited)” in Item 8. It is based on the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s regulatory guidelines for reporting cross-border information and represents the amounts that we may not be
able to obtain from a foreign country due to country-specific events, including unfavorable economic and political conditions, economic and social instability, and changes in government policies.

There can be substantial differences between our country risk exposure and cross-border risk exposure. For instance, unlike the cross-border
risk exposure, our country risk exposure includes the effect of certain risk mitigants. In addition, the basis for determining the domicile of the country risk exposure is different from the basis for determining the cross-border risk exposure.
Cross-border risk exposure is reported based on the country of jurisdiction for the obligor or guarantor. For country risk exposure, we consider factors in

addition to that of country of jurisdiction, including physical location of operations or assets, location and source of cash flows/revenues and location of collateral (if applicable) in order to
determine the basis for country risk exposure. Furthermore, cross-border risk exposure incorporates CDS only where protection is purchased, while country risk exposure incorporates CDS where protection is purchased or sold.

Our sovereign exposures consist of financial instruments entered into with sovereign and local governments. Our non-sovereign exposures
consist of exposures to primarily corporations and financial institutions. The following table shows our 10 largest non-U.S. country risk net exposures at December 31, 2016. Index credit derivatives are included in the country risk exposure table.
Each reference entity within an index is allocated to that reference entity’s country of risk. Index exposures are allocated to the underlying reference entities in proportion to the notional weighting of each reference entity in the index,
adjusted for any fair value receivable/payable for that reference entity. Where credit risk crosses multiple jurisdictions, for example, a CDS purchased from an issuer in a specific country that references bonds issued by an entity in a different
country, the fair value of the CDS is reflected in the Net Counterparty Exposure column based on the country of the CDS issuer. Further, the notional amount of the CDS adjusted for the fair value of the receivable/payable is reflected in the Net
Inventory column based on the country of the underlying reference entity.

Net inventory represents exposure to both long and short single-name and index positions (

i.e.

, bonds and
equities at fair value and CDS based on a notional amount assuming zero recovery adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable). As a market maker, we may transact in these CDS positions to facilitate client trading. At December 31, 2016,
gross purchased protection, gross written protection, and net exposures related to single-name and index credit derivatives for those countries were $(85.3) billion, $83.7 billion and $(1.6) billion, respectively. For a further description of
the triggers for purchased credit protection and whether those triggers may limit the effectiveness of our hedges, see “Credit Exposure—Derivatives” herein.

2.

Net counterparty exposure (

i.e

., repurchase transactions, securities lending and OTC derivatives) takes into
consideration legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral.

3.

At December 31, 2016, the benefit of collateral received against counterparty credit exposure was
$9.5 billion in the U.K., with 96% of collateral consisting of cash and government obligations of the U.K., U.S. and France, and $6.6 billion in Japan with nearly all collateral consisting of cash and government obligations of Japan. The
benefit of collateral received against counterparty credit exposure in the other countries totaled approximately $10.6 billion, with collateral primarily consisting of cash and government obligations of the U.S. These amounts do not include
collateral received on secured financing transactions.

4.

Amounts represent CDS hedges (purchased and sold) on net counterparty exposure and lending executed by trading desks
responsible for hedging counterparty and lending credit risk exposures for us. Amounts are based on the CDS notional amount assuming zero recovery adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable.

5.

In addition, at December 31, 2016, we had exposure to these countries for overnight deposits with banks of
approximately $10.2 billion.

Country Risk Exposures Related to the United Kingdom.

At
December 31, 2016, our country risk exposures in the U.K. included net exposures of $14,702 million (shown in the previous table) and overnight deposits of $5,514 million. The $16,168 million (shown in the previous table) of
exposures to

non-sovereigns

were diversified across both names and sectors. Of this exposure, $14,161 million is to investment grade counterparties, with the largest single component ($4,408 million) to
exchanges and clearinghouses.

Country Risk Exposures Related to Brazil

.    At December 31, 2016, our
country risk exposures in Brazil included net exposures of $5,215 million (shown in the previous table). Our sovereign net exposures in Brazil were principally in the form of local currency government bonds held onshore to support client
activity. The $582 million (shown in the previous table) of exposures to

non-sovereigns

were diversified across both names and sectors.

Country Risk Exposures Related to China.

At December 31, 2016, our country risk
exposures in China included net exposures of $2,075 million (shown in the previous table) and overnight deposits with international banks of $159 million. The $2,269 million (shown in the previous table) of exposures to

non-sovereigns

were diversified across both names and sectors and were primarily concentrated in high-quality positions with negligible direct exposure to onshore equities.

Operational Risk

Operational risk
refers to the risk of loss, or of damage to our reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or from external events (

e.g.

, fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical
assets). We may incur operational risk across the full scope of our business activities, including revenue-generating activities (

e.g

., sales and trading) and support and control groups (

e.g.

, information technology and trade
processing). On March 4, 2016, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”) updated its proposal for calculating operational risk regulatory capital. Under the proposal, which would eliminate the use of an internal model-based
approach, required levels of operational risk regulatory capital would generally be determined under a standardized approach based primarily on a financial statement-based measure of operational risk exposure and adjustments based on the particular
institution’s historic operational loss record. The revised proposal will be subject to further rulemaking procedures and its timing has not been specified.

We have established an operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and control risk
across the Firm. Effective operational risk management is essential to reducing the impact of operational risk incidents and mitigating legal, regulatory and reputational risks. The framework is continually evolving to account for changes in the
Firm and to respond to the changing regulatory and business environment. We have implemented operational risk data and assessment systems to monitor and analyze internal and external operational risk events, to assess business environment and
internal control factors and to perform scenario analysis. The collected data elements are incorporated in the operational risk capital model. The model encompasses both quantitative and qualitative elements. Internal loss data and scenario analysis
results are direct inputs to the capital model, while external operational incidents, business environment and internal control factors are evaluated as part of the scenario analysis process.

In addition, we employ a variety of risk processes and mitigants to manage our operational risk exposures. These include a strong governance
framework, a comprehensive risk management program and insurance. Operational risks and associated risk exposures are assessed relative to the risk tolerance established by the Board and are prioritized accordingly. The breadth and range of
operational risk are such that the types of mitigating activities are wide-ranging. Examples of activities include enhancing defenses against cyberattacks; use of legal agreements and contracts to transfer and/or limit operational risk
exposures; due diligence; implementation of enhanced policies and procedures; technology change management controls; exception management processing controls; and segregation of duties.

Primary responsibility for the management of operational risk is with the business segments, the control groups and the business managers
therein. The business managers maintain processes and controls designed to identify, assess, manage, mitigate and report operational risk. Each of the business segments has a designated operational risk coordinator. The operational risk coordinator
regularly reviews operational risk issues and reports to our senior management within each business. Each control group also has a designated operational risk coordinator and a forum for discussing operational risk matters with our senior
management. Oversight of operational risk is provided by the Operational Risk Oversight Committee, legal entity risk committees, regional risk committees and senior management. In the event of a merger; joint venture; divestiture; reorganization; or
creation of a new legal entity, a new product or a business activity, operational risks are considered, and any necessary changes in processes or controls are implemented.


December 2016 Form 10-K


Risk Disclosures

The Operational Risk Department is independent of the divisions and reports to the Chief Risk
Officer. The Operational Risk Department provides oversight of operational risk management and independently assesses, measures and monitors operational risk. The Operational Risk Department works with the divisions and control groups to help ensure
a transparent, consistent and comprehensive framework for managing operational risk within each area and across the Firm. The Operational Risk Department scope includes oversight of the technology and data risk management program (

e.g.

,
cybersecurity), fraud risk management and prevention program, and supplier risk management (vendor risk oversight and assessment) program. Furthermore, the Operational Risk Department supports the collection and reporting of operational risk
incidents and the execution of operational risk assessments; provides the infrastructure needed for risk measurement and risk management; and ensures ongoing validation and verification of our advanced measurement approach for operational risk
capital.

Business Continuity Management is responsible for identifying key risks and threats to our resiliency and planning to ensure
that a recovery strategy and required resources are in place for the resumption of critical business functions following a disaster or other business interruption. Disaster recovery plans are in place for critical facilities and resources on a
Firm-wide basis, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. The key components of our Business Continuity Management Program include: crisis management; business recovery plans; applications/data recovery; work area recovery;
and other elements addressing management, analysis, training and testing.

We maintain an information security program that coordinates
the management of information security risks and is designed to address regulatory requirements. Information security policies are designed to protect our information assets against unauthorized disclosure, modification or misuse. These policies
cover a broad range of areas, including: application entitlements, data protection, incident response, internet and electronic communications, remote access, mobile banking products, and portable devices. We have also established policies,
procedures and technologies to protect our computers and other assets from unauthorized access.

In connection with our ongoing
operations, we utilize the services of external vendors, which we anticipate will continue and may increase in the future. These services include, for example, outsourced processing and support functions and other professional services. We
manage our exposures to these services through a variety of means such as the performance of due diligence, consideration of operational risk, implementation of service level and other
contrac-

tual agreements, and ongoing monitoring of the vendors’ performance. We maintain a supplier risk management program with policies, procedures, organization, governance and supporting
technology that satisfies regulatory requirements. The program is designed to ensure that adequate risk management controls over the services exist, including, but not limited to, information security, operational failure, financial stability,
disaster recoverability, reputational risk, safeguards against corruption and termination.

Model Risk

Model risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. Model risk can lead to
financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making, or damage to a Firm’s reputation. The risk inherent in a model is a function of the materiality, complexity and uncertainty around inputs and assumptions. Model risk is generated from
the use of models impacting financial statements, regulatory filings, capital adequacy assessments and the formulation of strategy.

Sound
model risk management is an integral part of our Risk Management Framework. Model Risk Management is a distinct department in Risk Management responsible for the independent oversight of model risk. It is independent of the business units and
reports to the Chief Risk Officer.

The Model Risk Management Department establishes a model risk tolerance in line with our risk
appetite. The tolerance is based on an assessment of the materiality of the risk of financial loss or reputational damage due to errors in design, implementation, and/or inappropriate use of models. The tolerance is monitored through model-specific
and aggregate business-level assessments, which are based upon qualitative and quantitative factors.

A guiding principle for managing
model risk is the “effective challenge” of models. The effective challenge of models is represented by the critical analysis by objective, informed parties who can identify model limitations and assumptions and drive appropriate changes.
The Model Risk Management Department provides effective challenge of models, independently validates and approves models for use, annually recertifies models, reports identified model validation limitations to key stakeholders, tracks remediation
plans for model validation limitations, and reports on model risk metrics. The department also develops controls to support a complete and accurate Firm-wide model inventory. The Model Risk Management Department reports on our model risk relative to
risk tolerance and presents these reports to the Model Oversight Committee, the FRC, and the Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Risk Officer also provides quarterly updates to the BRC on model risk metrics.

December 2016 Form 10-K



Risk Disclosures

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or
difficulty in liquidating our assets. Liquidity risk also encompasses our ability (or perceived ability) to meet our financial obligations without experiencing significant business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability as
a going concern. Liquidity risk also encompasses the associated funding risks triggered by the market or idiosyncratic stress events that may negatively affect our liquidity and may impact our ability to raise new funding. Generally, we incur
liquidity and funding risk as a result of our trading, lending, investing and client facilitation activities.

Our Liquidity Risk
Management Framework is critical to helping ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity reserves and durable funding sources to meet our daily obligations and to withstand unanticipated stress events. The Liquidity Risk Department is a distinct
area in Risk Management responsible for the oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk. The Liquidity Risk Department is independent of the business units and reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The Liquidity Risk Department ensures transparency of
material liquidity and funding risks, compliance with established risk limits and escalation of risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. To execute these responsibilities, the Liquidity Risk Department establishes limits in line with
our risk appetite, identifies and analyzes emerging liquidity and funding risks to ensure such risks are appropriately mitigated, monitors and reports risk exposures against metrics and limits, and reviews the methodologies and assumptions
underpinning our Liquidity Stress Tests to ensure sufficient liquidity and funding under a range of adverse scenarios. The liquidity and funding risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the Liquidity Risk Department
that are circulated to and discussed with senior management, the FRC, the BRC and the Board, as appropriate.

The Treasury Department and applicable business units have primary responsibility for
evaluating, monitoring and controlling the liquidity and funding risks arising from our business activities, and for maintaining processes and controls to manage the key risks inherent in their respective areas. The Liquidity Risk Department
coordinates with the Treasury Department and these business units to help ensure a consistent and comprehensive framework for managing liquidity and funding risk across the Firm. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7.

Legal and Compliance Risk

Legal and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, including fines, penalties, judgments,
damages and/or settlements, or loss to reputation that we may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. This risk
also includes contractual and commercial risk, such as the risk that a counterparty’s performance obligations will be unenforceable. It also includes compliance with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules and regulations. We are
generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business (see also “Business—Supervision and Regulation” in Part I, Item 1, and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A).
We have established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to facilitate compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and to require that our policies relating to business
conduct, ethics and practices are followed globally. In addition, we have established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterparty’s performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authority
and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. The heightened legal and regulatory focus on the
financial services and banking industry presents a continuing business challenge for us.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Morgan Stanley:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Morgan Stanley and subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of December 31,
2016 and 2015 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in total equity for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of the Firm’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and

significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Firm as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Firm’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Introduction and Basis of Presentation

The Firm

Morgan Stanley, a financial
holding company, is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of its business segments—Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management. Morgan Stanley, through its subsidiaries
and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms
“Morgan Stanley” or the “Firm” mean Morgan Stanley (the “Parent Company”) together with its consolidated subsidiaries.

A description of the clients and principal products and services of each of the Firm’s business segments is as follows:

Institutional Securities

provides investment banking, sales and trading, lending and other services to corporations,
governments, financial institutions, and high to ultra-high net worth clients. Investment banking services consist of capital raising and financial advisory services, including services relating to the underwriting of debt, equity and other
securities, as well as advice on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, real estate and project finance. Sales and trading services include sales, financing and market-making activities in equity and fixed income products, including foreign
exchange and commodities, as well as prime brokerage services. Lending services include originating and/or purchasing corporate loans, commercial and residential mortgage lending, asset-backed lending, financing extended to equities and commodities
customers, and loans to municipalities. Other activities include investments and research.

Wealth Management

provides a comprehensive array of financial services and solutions to individual investors and small to

medium-sized

businesses and institutions covering brokerage and investment advisory services, financial
and wealth planning services, annuity and insurance products, credit and other lending products, banking and retirement plan services.

Investment Management

provides a broad range of investment strategies and products that span geographies, asset
classes, and public and private markets to a diverse group of clients across institutional and intermediary channels. Strategies and products include equity, fixed income, liquidity and alternative/other products. Institutional clients include
defined benefit/defined contribution plans, foundations, endowments, government entities, sovereign wealth

funds, insurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and corporations. Individual clients are serviced through intermediaries, including affiliated and

non-affiliated

distributors.

Basis of Financial Information

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“U.S. GAAP”), which require the Firm to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of certain financial instruments, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, compensation, deferred tax assets, the outcome of legal and
tax matters, allowance for credit losses and other matters that affect its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Firm believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements are
prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to the current presentation.

Consolidation

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Firm, its wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, including certain variable interest entities (“VIE”) (see Note 13). For
consolidated subsidiaries that are less than wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as noncontrolling interests. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as Net
income applicable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated income statements. The portion of shareholders’ equity that is attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as noncontrolling interests, a
component of total equity, in the consolidated balance sheets.

For entities where (1) the total equity investment at risk is
sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support and (2) the equity holders bear the economic residual risks and returns of the entity and have the power to direct the activities of the
entity that most significantly affect its economic performance, the Firm consolidates those entities it controls either through a majority voting interest or otherwise. For VIEs (

i.e.

, entities that do not meet these criteria), the Firm
consolidates those entities where it has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be
significant to the VIE, except for certain VIEs that are money market funds, investment companies or entities qualifying for accounting purposes as investment companies. Generally, the Firm

December 2016 Form 10-K



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

consolidates those entities when it absorbs a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns, or both, of the entities.

For investments in entities in which the Firm does not have a controlling financial interest but has significant influence over operating and
financial decisions, it generally applies the equity method of accounting with net gains and losses recorded within Other revenues (see Note 8). Where the Firm has elected to measure certain eligible investments at fair value in accordance with the
fair value option, net gains and losses are recorded within Investments revenues (see Note 3).

Equity and partnership interests held by
entities qualifying for accounting purposes as investment companies are carried at fair value.

The Firm’s significant regulated U.S.
and international subsidiaries include Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“MS&Co.”), Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“MSSB LLC”), Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc (“MSIP”), Morgan Stanley MUFG
Securities Co., Ltd. (“MSMS”), Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. (“MSBNA”) and Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association (“MSPBNA”).

Consolidated Cash Flow Statements Presentation

For purposes of the consolidated cash flow statements, cash and cash equivalents consist of Cash and due from banks and Interest bearing
deposits with banks, which include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, that are held for investment purposes and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.

The adoption of the accounting update,

Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis

(see Note 2) on January 1, 2016 resulted in a net
noncash increase in total assets of $126 million. The Firm deconsolidated approximately $244 million and $1.6 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively, in net assets previously attributable to noncontrolling interests that were
primarily related to or associated with real estate funds sponsored by the Firm. The deconsolidations resulted in a noncash reduction of assets of $222 million in 2015 and $1.3 billion in 2014.

Dispositions

The Firm completed
the sale of its global oil merchanting unit of the commodities division to Castleton Commodities International LLC on November 1, 2015. The Firm recognized an impairment charge of approximately $71 million in Other revenues. The
transaction did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations and did not have a material impact on the Firm’s financial results.

On July 1, 2014, the Firm completed the sale of its ownership stake in TransMontaigne Inc.,
a U.S.-based oil storage, marketing and transportation company, as well as related physical inventory and the assumption of its obligations under certain terminal storage contracts, to NGL Energy Partners LP. The gain on sale of $112 million is
recorded in Other revenues.

On March 27, 2014, the Firm completed the sale of Canterm Canadian Terminals Inc., a public storage
terminal operator for refined products with two distribution terminals in Canada. The gain on sale was approximately $45 million and is recorded in Other revenues.

2. Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue Recognition

Investment Banking

Underwriting revenues and advisory fees from mergers, acquisitions and restructuring transactions are recorded when services for
the transactions are determined to be substantially completed, generally as set forth under the terms of the engagement. Transaction-related expenses, primarily consisting of legal, travel and other costs directly associated with the transaction,
are deferred and recognized in the same period as the related investment banking transaction revenues. Underwriting revenues are presented net of related expenses.

Non-reimbursed

expenses associated with
advisory transactions are recorded within

Non-interest

expenses.

Commissions and Fees

Commission and fee revenues are recognized on trade date. Commission and fee revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and

over-the-counter

(“OTC”) equity securities; services related to sales and trading activities; and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options.

Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees

Asset management, distribution and administration fees are recognized over the relevant contract period. Sales commissions paid by the Firm in
connection with the sale of certain classes of shares of its

open-end

mutual fund products are accounted for as deferred commission assets. The Firm periodically tests deferred commission assets for
recoverability based on cash flows expected to be received in future periods.

In certain management fee arrangements, the Firm is
entitled to receive performance-based fees (which also may be referred to as incentive fees and which include carried interest) when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets. In such
arrangements, performance fee revenues are accrued (or reversed) quarterly based on measuring account or fund performance to date versus the performance

mark stated in the investment management agreement. Performance-based fees are recorded within Investments or Asset management, distribution and administration fees depending on the nature of the
arrangement.

The Firm’s portion of the unrealized cumulative amount of performance-based fee revenues (for which the Firm is not
obligated to pay compensation) at risk of reversing if fund performance falls below stated investment management agreement benchmarks was approximately $397 million and $422 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively. See Note 12 for information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Instruments within Trading assets and Trading liabilities are measured at fair value, either in accordance with accounting guidance or through
the fair value option election (discussed below). These financial instruments primarily represent the Firm’s trading and investment positions and include both cash and derivative products. In addition, debt securities classified as
available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities are measured at fair value.

Gains and losses on instruments carried at fair value are
reflected in Trading revenues, Investments revenues or Investment banking revenues in the consolidated income statements, except for AFS securities (see “Investment Securities—Available for Sale and Held to Maturity” section herein
and Note 5) and derivatives accounted for as hedges (see “Hedge Accounting” section herein and Note 4).

Interest income and
interest expense are recorded within the consolidated income statements depending on the nature of the instrument and related market conventions. When interest is included as a component of the instruments’ fair value, interest is
included within Trading revenues or Investments revenues. Otherwise, it is included within Interest income or Interest expense. Dividend income is recorded in Trading revenues or Investments revenues depending on the business activity.

The fair value of OTC financial instruments, including derivative contracts related to financial instruments and commodities, is
presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets on a

net-by-counterparty

basis, when appropriate. Additionally, the Firm nets the fair value of cash collateral
paid or received against the fair value amounts recognized for net derivative positions executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement.

Fair Value Option

The fair value option permits the irrevocable fair value option election at initial recognition of an asset or liability or upon an event that
gives rise to a new basis of accounting for that instrument. The Firm applies the fair value option for eligible instruments, including certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell, loans and lending commitments, equity method
investments, Deposits (structured certificate of deposits), Short-term borrowings (primarily structured notes), Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, Other secured financings and Long-term borrowings (primarily structured notes).

Fair Value Measurement—Definition and Hierarchy

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (

i.e.

, the “exit
price”) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

In determining fair value, the Firm uses
various valuation approaches and establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used
when available.

Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that were developed
based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Firm. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect assumptions the Firm believes other market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that are developed based on the best
information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the observability of inputs as follows:

Level

1.

Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets that the Firm has the ability to
access for identical assets or liabilities. Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 instruments. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of
these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.

Level

2.

Valuations
based on one or more quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.

Level

3.

Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair
value measurement.

The availability of observable inputs can vary from product to product and is affected by a wide variety of factors,

December 2016 Form 10-K



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

including, for example, the type of product, whether the product is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the product.
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Firm in determining fair
value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Firm considers prices and inputs that are
current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be
reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (see Note 3).

In certain
cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in
its entirety is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

For
assets and liabilities that are transferred between levels in the fair value hierarchy during the period, fair values are ascribed as if the assets or liabilities had been transferred as of the beginning of the period.

Valuation Techniques

Many cash
instruments and OTC derivative contracts have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. Bid prices reflect the highest price that a party is willing to pay for an asset. Ask prices represent the lowest price that a party is willing
to accept for an asset. The Firm carries positions at the point within the

bid-ask

range that meet its best estimate of fair value. For offsetting positions in the same financial instrument, the same price
within the

bid-ask

spread is used to measure both the long and short positions.

Fair value for
many cash instruments and OTC derivative contracts is derived using pricing models. Pricing models take into account the contract terms, as well as multiple inputs, including, where applicable, commodity prices, equity prices, interest rate yield
curves, credit curves, correlation, creditworthiness of the counterparty, creditworthiness of the Firm, option volatility and currency rates.

Where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk

(bid-ask

adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty and concentration risk. Adjustments for liquidity risk adjust model-derived

mid-market

levels of Level 2
and Level 3 financial
instru-

ments for the

bid-mid

or

mid-ask

spread required to properly reflect the exit price of a risk position. Bid-mid and

mid-ask

spreads are marked to levels observed in trade activity, broker quotes or other external third-party data. Where these spreads are unobservable for the particular position in question, spreads are
derived from observable levels of similar positions.

The Firm applies credit-related valuation adjustments to its short-term and
long-term borrowings (primarily structured notes) for which the fair value option was elected and to OTC derivatives. The Firm considers the impact of changes in its own credit spreads based upon observations of the secondary bond market spreads
when measuring the fair value for short-term and long-term borrowings.

For OTC derivatives, the impact of changes in both the Firm’s
and the counterparty’s credit rating is considered when measuring fair value. In determining the expected exposure, the Firm simulates the distribution of the future exposure to a counterparty, then applies market-based default probabilities to
the future exposure, leveraging external third-party credit default swap (“CDS”) spread data. Where CDS spread data are unavailable for a specific counterparty, bond market spreads, CDS spread data based on the counterparty’s credit
rating or CDS spread data that reference a comparable counterparty may be utilized. The Firm also considers collateral held and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate its exposure to each counterparty.

Adjustments for model uncertainty are taken for positions whose underlying models are reliant on significant inputs that are neither directly
nor indirectly observable, hence requiring reliance on established theoretical concepts in their derivation. These adjustments are derived by making assessments of the possible degree of variability using statistical approaches and market-based
information where possible.

The Firm may apply a concentration adjustment to certain of its OTC derivatives portfolios to reflect the
additional cost of closing out a particularly large risk exposure. Where possible, these adjustments are based on observable market information, but in many instances, significant judgment is required to estimate the costs of closing
out concentrated risk exposures due to the lack of liquidity in the marketplace.

The Firm applies funding valuation adjustments
(“FVA”) into the fair value measurements of OTC uncollateralized or partially collateralized derivatives and in collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the reuse of the collateral received. The Firm’s
implementation of FVA reflects the inclusion of FVA in the pricing and valuations by the majority of market participants involved in its principal exit market for these instruments. In general, FVA


December 2016 Form 10-K


Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

reflects a market funding risk premium inherent in the noted derivative instruments. The methodology for measuring FVA leverages the Firm’s existing credit-related valuation adjustment
calculation methodologies, which apply to both assets and liabilities.

Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the
perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, assumptions are set to reflect those that the Firm believes market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability at the measurement date. Where the Firm manages a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of its net exposure to either market risks or credit risk, the Firm measures the fair value of that group of
financial instruments consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.

See Note 3 for
a description of valuation techniques applied to the major categories of financial instruments measured at fair value.

Assets and Liabilities
Measured at Fair Value on a

Non-Recurring

Basis

Certain of the Firm’s assets and
liabilities are measured at fair value on a

non-recurring

basis. The Firm incurs losses or gains for any adjustments of these assets or liabilities to fair value.

For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a

non-recurring

basis, fair value is determined
by using various valuation approaches. The same hierarchy for inputs as described above, which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by generally requiring that the observable inputs be used when
available, is used in measuring fair value for these items.

Valuation Process

The Valuation Review Group (“VRG”) within the Firm’s Financial Control Group (“FCG”) is responsible for the
Firm’s fair value valuation policies, processes and procedures. VRG is independent of the business units and reports to the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), who has final authority over the valuation of the Firm’s financial
instruments. VRG implements valuation control processes designed to validate the fair value of the Firm’s financial instruments measured at fair value, including those derived from pricing models.

Model Review.

VRG, in conjunction with the Model Risk
Management Department (“MRM”), which reports to the Chief Risk Officer, independently review valuation models’ theoretical soundness, the appropriateness of the valuation methodology and calibration techniques developed by the
business units using observable inputs. Where inputs are not observable, VRG reviews the appropriateness of the proposed valuation methodology to determine that it is consistent with how a market participant would arrive at the unobservable input.
The valuation methodologies utilized in the absence of observable inputs may include extrapolation techniques and the use of comparable observable inputs. As part of the review, VRG develops a methodology to independently verify the fair value
generated by the business unit’s valuation models. The Firm generally subjects valuations and models to a review process initially and on a periodic basis thereafter.

Independent Price Verification.

The business units are responsible for determining the fair value of financial
instruments using approved valuation models and valuation methodologies. Generally on a monthly basis, VRG independently validates the fair values of financial instruments determined using valuation models by determining the appropriateness of the
inputs used by the business units and by testing compliance with the documented valuation methodologies approved in the model review process described above.

The results of this independent price verification and any adjustments made by VRG to the fair value generated by the business units are
presented to management of the Firm’s three business segments (

i.e.,

Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management), the CFO and the Chief Risk Officer on a regular basis.

VRG uses recently executed transactions, other observable market data such as exchange data, broker-dealer quotes, third-party pricing vendors
and aggregation services for validating the fair value of financial instruments generated using valuation models. VRG assesses the external sources and their valuation methodologies to determine if the external providers meet the minimum standards
expected of a third-party pricing source. Pricing data provided by approved external sources are evaluated using a number of approaches; for example, by corroborating the external sources’ prices to executed trades, by analyzing the methodology
and assumptions used by the external source to generate a price, and/or by evaluating how active the third-party pricing source (or originating sources used by the third-party pricing source) is in the market. Based on this analysis, VRG generates a
ranking of the observable market data designed to ensure that the highest-ranked market data source is used to validate the business unit’s fair value of financial instruments.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

VRG reviews the models and valuation methodology used to price new material Level 2 and
Level 3 transactions, and both FCG and MRM must approve the fair value of the trade that is initially recognized.

Level

3 Transactions.

VRG reviews the business unit’s valuation techniques to assess
whether these are consistent with market participant assumptions.

For further information on financial assets and liabilities that are
measured at fair value on a recurring and

non-recurring

basis, see Note 3.

Offsetting of Derivative
Instruments

In connection with its derivative activities, the Firm generally enters into master netting agreements and collateral
agreements with its counterparties. These agreements provide the Firm with the right, in the event of a default by the counterparty, to net a counterparty’s rights and obligations under the agreement and to liquidate and set off collateral
against any net amount owed by the counterparty.

However, in certain circumstances, the Firm may not have such an agreement in place; the
relevant insolvency regime may not support the enforceability of the master netting agreement or collateral agreement; or the Firm may not have sought legal advice to support the enforceability of the agreement. In cases where the Firm has not
determined an agreement to be enforceable, the related amounts are not offset in the tabular disclosures (see Note 4).

The Firm’s
policy is generally to receive securities and cash posted as collateral (with rights of rehypothecation), irrespective of the enforceability determination regarding the master netting and collateral agreement. In certain cases, the Firm may agree
for such collateral to be posted to a third-party custodian under a control agreement that enables it to take control of such collateral in the event of a counterparty default. The enforceability of the master netting agreement is taken into account
in the Firm’s risk management practices and application of counterparty credit limits.

For information related to offsetting of
derivatives and certain collateralized transactions, see Notes 4 and 6, respectively.

Hedge Accounting

The Firm applies hedge accounting using various derivative financial instruments for the following types of hedges: hedges of changes in fair
value of assets and liabilities due to the risk being hedged (fair value hedges); and hedges of net investments in foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the reporting currency of the Parent Company (net investment hedges).
These financial
instru-

ments are included within Trading assets—Derivative and other contracts or Trading liabilities—Derivative and other contracts in the consolidated balance sheets. For hedges where hedge
accounting is being applied, the Firm performs effectiveness testing and other procedures.

Fair Value Hedges—Interest Rate Risk

The Firm’s designated fair value hedges consist primarily of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of changes in the
benchmark interest rate of fixed rate senior long-term borrowings. The Firm uses regression analysis to perform an ongoing prospective and retrospective assessment of the effectiveness of these hedging relationships. A hedging relationship is deemed
effective if the change in fair value of the hedging instrument (derivative) and the change in fair value of the hedged item (debt liability) due to changes in the benchmark interest rate offset within a range of 80% to 125%. The Firm considers the
impact of valuation adjustments related to its own credit spreads and counterparty credit spreads to determine whether they would cause the hedging relationship to be ineffective.

For qualifying fair value hedges of benchmark interest rates, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the changes in the fair
value of the hedged liability provide offset of one another and, together with any resulting ineffectiveness, are recorded in Interest expense. When a derivative is

de-designated

as a hedge, any basis
adjustment remaining on the hedged liability is amortized to Interest expense over the remaining life of the liability using the effective interest method.

Net Investment Hedges

The Firm
uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage a portion of the currency exposure relating to its net investments in

non-U.S.

dollar functional currency operations. To the extent that the notional amounts
of the hedging instruments equal the portion of the investments being hedged and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging instrument relates to the exchange rate between the functional currency of the investee and the Parent
Company’s functional currency, no hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings. If these exchange rates are not the same, the Firm uses regression analysis to assess the prospective and retrospective effectiveness of the hedge relationships,
and any ineffectiveness is recognized in Interest income. The gain or loss from revaluing hedges of net investments in foreign operations at the spot rate is reported within AOCI. The forward points on the hedging instruments are excluded from hedge
effectiveness testing and are recorded in Interest income.

For further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities, see
Note 4.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Loans

The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: loans held for investment; loans held for sale; and loans at fair value.

Loans Held for Investment

Loans
held for investment are reported at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses, any unamortized deferred fees or costs for originated loans, and any unamortized premiums or discounts for purchased loans.

Interest Income.

Interest income on performing loans held for investment is accrued and recognized as
interest income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the life of the loan to produce a level rate of return.

Allowance for Loan Losses.

The allowance for loan losses estimates probable losses related to loans
specifically identified for impairment in addition to the probable losses inherent in the held for investment loan portfolio.

The Firm
utilizes the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention substandard, doubtful and loss categories as credit quality indicators. For further information on the credit indicators, see Note 7.
Substandard loans are regularly reviewed for impairment. Factors considered by management when determining impairment include payment status, fair value of collateral, and probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due.
The impairment analysis required depends on the nature and type of loans. Loans classified as Doubtful or Loss are considered impaired.

There are two components of the allowance for loan losses: the specific allowance component and the inherent allowance component.

The specific allowance component of the allowance for loan losses is used to estimate probable losses for

non-homogeneous

exposures that have been specifically identified for impairment analysis by the Firm and determined to be impaired. When a loan is specifically identified for impairment, the impairment is
measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or as a practical expedient, the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is
collateral dependent. If the present value of the expected future cash flows (or alternatively, the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral) is less than the recorded investment in the loan, then the Firm

recognizes an allowance and a charge to the provision for loan losses within Other revenues.

The inherent allowance component of the allowance for loan losses is used to estimate the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and
includes

non-homogeneous

loans that have not been identified as impaired and portfolios of smaller balance homogeneous loans. The Firm maintains methodologies by loan product for calculating an allowance for
loan losses that estimates the inherent losses in the loan portfolio. Generally, inherent losses in the portfolio for

non-impaired

loans are estimated using statistical analysis and judgment around the
exposure at default, the probability of default and the loss given default. Qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio, and lending terms and volume and severity of past due
loans may also be considered in the calculations. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level reasonable to ensure that it can adequately absorb the estimated probable losses inherent in the portfolio. The Firm recognizes an allowance and
a charge to the provision for loan losses within Other revenues.

Troubled Debt Restructurings.

The
Firm may modify the terms of certain loans for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties by granting one or more concessions that the Firm would not otherwise consider. Such modifications are accounted for and
reported as troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”). A loan that has been modified in a TDR is generally considered to be impaired and is evaluated for the extent of impairment using the Firm’s specific allowance methodology. TDRs are
also generally classified as nonaccrual and may only be returned to accrual status after considering the borrower’s sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period.

Nonaccrual Loans.

The Firm places loans on nonaccrual status if principal or interest is past due for a
period of 90 days or more or payment of principal or interest is in doubt unless the obligation is well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan is considered past due when a payment due according to the contractual terms of the loan
agreement has not been remitted by the borrower. Substandard loans, if identified as impaired, are categorized as nonaccrual. Loans classified as Doubtful or Loss are categorized as nonaccrual.

Payments received on nonaccrual loans held for investment are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of
principal (

i.e

., cost recovery method). If collection of the principal of nonaccrual loans held for investment is not in doubt, interest income is recognized on a cash basis. If neither principal nor interest collection is in doubt, loans are
on accrual status, and interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. Loans that are on
nonac-

December 2016 Form 10-K



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

crual status may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent principal and/or interest has been brought current after a reasonable period of performance, typically a minimum of
six months.

Charge-offs.

The Firm charges off a loan in the period that it is deemed
uncollectible and records a reduction in the allowance for loan losses and the balance of the loan. In general, any portion of the recorded investment in a collateral dependent loan (including any capitalized accrued interest, net deferred loan fees
or costs, and unamortized premium or discount) in excess of the fair value of the collateral that can be identified as uncollectible, and is therefore deemed a confirmed loss, is charged off against the allowance for loan losses. A loan is
collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the sale or operation of the underlying collateral. In addition, for loan transfers from loans held for investment to loans held for sale, at the time of
transfer, any reduction in the loan value is reflected as a

charge-off

of the recorded investment, resulting in a new cost basis.

Lending Commitments.

The Firm records the liability and related expense for the credit exposure related
to commitments to fund loans that will be held for investment in a manner similar to outstanding loans disclosed above. The analysis also incorporates a credit conversion factor, which is the expected utilization of the undrawn commitment. The
liability is recorded in Other liabilities and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets, and the expense is recorded in Other

non-interest

expenses in the consolidated income statements. For more
information regarding loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, see Note 12.

Loans Held for Sale

Loans held for sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in Other revenues. The Firm determines
the valuation allowance on an individual loan basis, except for residential mortgage loans for which the valuation allowance is determined at the loan product level. Any decreases in fair value below the initial carrying amount and any recoveries in
fair value up to the initial carrying amount are recorded in Other revenues. However, increases in fair value above initial carrying value are not recognized.

Interest income on loans held for sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Loan origination fees or costs and
purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and, therefore, are

included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.

Lending Commitments

.    Commitments to fund

non-mortgage

loans held for
sale are not derivatives. The Firm records the liability and related expense for the fair value exposure (if the fair value is below the cost) related to commitments to fund

non-mortgage

loans that will be
held for sale in Other liabilities and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets with an offset to Other revenues in the consolidated income statements. Commitments to fund mortgage loans held for sale are derivatives. The Firm records the
derivative asset or liability exposure in Trading assets or Trading liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets with an offset to Trading revenues in the consolidated income statements.

Loans and lending commitments held for sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. Because loans and lending commitments held
for sale are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the allowance for loan losses and

charge-off

policies does not apply to these loans.

Loans at Fair Value

Loans for
which the fair value option is elected are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Loans carried at fair value are not evaluated for purposes of recording an allowance for loan losses. For further information on
loans carried at fair value and classified as Trading assets and Trading liabilities

,

see Note 3.

Lending
Commitments.

The Firm records the liability and related expense for the fair value exposure related to commitments to fund loans that will be measured at fair value. The liability is recorded in Trading liabilities in
the consolidated balance sheets, and the expense is recorded in Trading revenues in the consolidated income statements.

For further
information on loans, see Note 7.

Transfers of Financial Assets

Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when the Firm has relinquished control over the transferred assets. Any related gain
or loss on sale is recorded in Net revenues. Transfers that are not accounted for as sales are treated as a collateralized financing, in certain cases referred to as “failed sales.” Securities borrowed or purchased under
agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financings (see Note 6). Securities purchased under agreements to resell (“reverse repurchase
agreements”) and Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“repurchase agreements”) are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at the amounts of


December 2016 Form 10-K


Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

cash paid or received, plus accrued interest, except for certain repurchase agreements for which the Firm has elected the fair value option (see Note 3). Where appropriate, repurchase
agreements and reverse repurchase agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. Securities borrowed and securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received.

Premises, Equipment and Software Costs

Premises, equipment and software costs consist of buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, computer and communications
equipment, power generation assets, terminals, pipelines and software (externally purchased and developed for internal use). Premises, equipment and software costs are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and are included in
Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Depreciation and amortization are provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Estimated useful lives are generally as follows: buildings—39 years; furniture
and fixtures—7 years; computer and communications equipment—3 to 9 years; power generation assets—15 to 29 years; and terminals, pipelines and equipment—3 to 30 years. Estimated useful lives for software costs are generally 3 to
10 years.

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or, where applicable, the
remaining term of the lease but generally not exceeding 25 years for building structural improvements and 15 years for other improvements.

Premises, equipment and software costs are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset’s
carrying value may not be fully recoverable in accordance with current accounting guidance.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Firm tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. The Firm tests
for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below its business segments. For both the annual and interim tests, the Firm has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the
existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Firm determines
it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the

two-step

impairment test is not required. However, if the Firm concludes otherwise,
then it is required to perform the first step of the

two-step

impairment test.

Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with
its respective carrying value. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is below carrying value, however, further analysis is required to
determine the amount of the impairment. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are derived based on valuation techniques the Firm believes market participants would use for each of the reporting units.

The estimated fair values are generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate

price-to-book

and

price-to-earnings

multiples of certain comparable companies.

Goodwill is not amortized but, as noted above, is reviewed annually (or more frequently when certain events or circumstances exist) for
impairment. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded within Other expenses in the consolidated income statements.

Income Taxes

The Firm accounts for
income tax expense (benefit) using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based upon the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and
liabilities using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax expense (benefit) in the
period that includes the enactment date.

The Firm recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more
likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Firm considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning
strategies and results of recent operations. If a deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. If the Firm determines that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their
net recorded amount, it would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.

Uncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a

two-step

process, whereby (1) the Firm
determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained

December 2016 Form 10-K



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the

more-likely-than-not

recognition threshold, the
Firm recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as provision for income
taxes.

Earnings per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing earnings available to Morgan Stanley common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Earnings available to Morgan Stanley common shareholders represents net income applicable to Morgan Stanley reduced by preferred stock dividends and allocations of earnings to
participating securities. Common shares outstanding include common stock and vested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) where recipients have satisfied either the explicit vesting terms or retirement-eligibility requirements. Diluted EPS
reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities.

Unvested share-based payment awards that contain

non-forfeitable

rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and are included in the computation of EPS pursuant to the

two-class

method. Share-based payment awards that pay dividend equivalents subject to vesting are not deemed participating securities and are included in diluted shares outstanding (if dilutive) under the
treasury stock method.

The Firm has granted performance-based stock units (“PSUs”) that vest and convert to shares of common
stock only if it satisfies predetermined performance and market goals. Since the issuance of the shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, the PSUs are included in diluted EPS based on the number of shares (if any) that would
be issuable if the end of the reporting period was the end of the contingency period.

For the calculation of basic and diluted EPS, see
Note 16.

Deferred Compensation

Stock-Based
Compensation

The Firm measures compensation cost for stock-based awards at fair value and recognizes compensation cost over the
service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Firm determines the fair value of RSUs (including RSUs with

non-market

performance conditions) based on the grant-date fair value of its common stock, measured
as the

volume-weighted average price on the date of grant. RSUs with market-based conditions are valued using a Monte Carlo

valuation model. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and the single grant life method. Under the single grant life method, option awards with
graded vesting are valued using a single weighted average expected option life.

Compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards
is recognized using the graded vesting attribution method. Compensation expense for awards with performance conditions is recognized based on the probable outcome of the performance condition at each reporting date. Compensation expense for awards
with market-based conditions is recognized irrespective of the probability of the market condition being achieved and is not reversed if the market condition is not met.

The Firm recognizes the expense for stock-based awards over the requisite service period. These awards generally contain clawback and
cancellation provisions. Certain awards provide the Firm discretion to cancel all or a portion of the award under specified circumstances. Compensation expense for those awards is adjusted for changes in the fair value of the Firm’s common
stock or the relevant model valuation, as appropriate, until conversion, exercise or expiration.

For

year-end

stock-based awards anticipated to be granted to retirement-eligible employees under award terms that do not contain a future service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated cost over the course of
the calendar year preceding the grant date. The Firm believes that this method of recognition for retirement-eligible employees reflects the period over which the compensation is earned.

Employee Stock Trusts

In
connection with certain stock-based compensation plans, the Firm maintains and utilizes at its discretion trusts, referred to as “Employee stock trusts.” The assets of the Employee stock trusts are consolidated and, as such, are accounted
for in a manner similar to treasury stock, where the shares of common stock outstanding are offset by an equal amount in Common stock issued to employee stock trusts.

The Firm uses the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation as the basis for recognition of the assets in the Employee stock trusts.
Subsequent changes in the fair value are not recognized as the Firm’s stock-based compensation plans do not permit diversification and must be settled by the delivery of a fixed number of shares of the Firm’s common stock.

Deferred Cash-Based Compensation

Compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation plans is calculated based on the notional value of the award

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments. For unvested awards, the expense is recognized over the service period using the graded vesting attribution method.
For vested awards with only notional earnings on the referenced investments, the expense is fully recognized in the current period. For year-end awards anticipated to be granted to retirement-eligible employees under award terms that do not contain
a future service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated cost over the course of the calendar year preceding the grant date. The Firm believes that this method of recognition for retirement-eligible employees reflects the period over which the
compensation is earned.

The Firm often invests directly, as a principal, in investments or other financial instruments to economically
hedge its obligations under its deferred cash-based compensation plans. Changes in value of such investments made by the Firm are recorded in Trading revenues and Investments revenues. Changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the
fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the Firm. However, there may be a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the Firm’s
investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period.

Foreign Currencies

Assets and liabilities of operations having

non-U.S.

dollar functional currencies are translated at

year-end

rates of exchange. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements, net of hedge gains or losses and related tax effects, are reflected in AOCI, a separate component of
Morgan Stanley Shareholders’ equity on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains or losses resulting from remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are included in net income, and amounts recognized in the income statement are translated
at the rate of exchange on the respective date of recognition for each amount.

Investment Securities—Available for Sale and Held to Maturity

AFS securities are reported at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with unrealized gains and losses reported in AOCI, net
of tax. Interest and dividend income, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is included in Interest income in the consolidated income statements. Realized gains and losses on AFS securities are reported in the consolidated
income statements (see Note 5). The Firm utilizes the

“first-in,

first-out”

method as the basis for determining the cost of AFS securities.

Held-to-maturity (“HTM”) securities are reported at amortized cost in the consolidated balance sheets. Interest income,

including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on HTM securities, is included in Interest income in the consolidated income statements.

Other-than-temporary Impairment

AFS debt securities and HTM securities with a current fair value less than their amortized cost are analyzed as part of the Firm’s
periodic assessment of temporary versus other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) at the individual security level. A temporary impairment is recognized in AOCI. OTTI is recognized in the consolidated income statements with the exception of
the

non-credit

portion related to a debt security that the Firm does not intend to sell and is not likely to be required to sell, which is recognized in AOCI.

For AFS debt securities that the Firm either has the intent to sell or that the Firm is likely to be required to sell before recovery of its
amortized cost basis, the impairment is considered other-than-temporary.

For those AFS debt securities that the Firm does not have the
intent to sell or is not likely to be required to sell, and for all HTM securities, the Firm evaluates whether it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security. If the Firm does not expect to recover the entire amortized
cost of those AFS debt securities or HTM securities, the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, and the Firm determines what portion of the impairment relates to a credit loss and what portion relates to

non-credit

factors.

A credit loss exists if the present value of cash flows expected to be
collected (discounted at the implicit interest rate at acquisition of the security or discounted at the effective yield for securities that incorporate changes in prepayment assumptions) is less than the amortized cost basis of the security. Changes
in prepayment assumptions alone are not considered to result in a credit loss.

When determining if a credit loss exists, the Firm
considers relevant information, including:

•

the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis;

•

adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry or geographic area;

•

changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security or, in the case of an asset-backed debt
security, changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors;

•

the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security;

December 2016 Form 10-K



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

•

the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that
increase in the future;

•

failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments;

•

any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency;

•

recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.

When estimating the present value of expected cash flows, information includes the remaining payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds,
financial condition of the issuer(s), expected defaults and the value of any underlying collateral.

For AFS equity securities, the Firm
considers various factors, including the intent and ability to hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value in evaluating whether an OTTI exists. If the equity security is considered
other-than-temporarily impaired, the entire OTTI (

i.e.

, the difference between the fair value recorded on the balance sheet and the cost basis) will be recognized in the consolidated income statements.

Accounting Standards Adopted

The Firm
adopted the following accounting updates as of January 1, 2016:

•

Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities.

In January 2016, the Financial

Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued an accounting update that changed the requirements for the recognition and measurement of certain financial assets and financial
liabilities. The Firm early adopted the provision in this guidance relating to liabilities measured at fair value pursuant to a fair value option election that requires presenting unrealized DVA in Other comprehensive income (loss)
(“OCI”), a change from the previous requirement to present DVA in net income. Realized DVA amounts will be recycled from AOCI to Trading revenues. DVA amounts from periods prior to adoption remain in Trading revenues as previously
reported. A cumulative

catch-up

adjustment, net of noncontrolling interests and tax, of $312 million was recorded as of January 1, 2016 to move the cumulative unrealized DVA loss amount from Retained
earnings into AOCI.

Other provisions of this rule may not be early adopted and will be effective
January 1, 2018, but they are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

•

Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.

In February 2015, the FASB
issued an accounting update that provides a new consolidation model for certain entities, such as investment funds and limited partnerships. The Firm adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016 by recording a net adjustment to equity on
January 1, 2016. This adoption increased total assets by $131 million, reflecting consolidations of $206 million, net of deconsolidations of $75 million. The consolidations resulted primarily from certain funds in Investment
Management where the Firm acts as a general partner.

•Fair value is determined using quoted market prices; valuation adjustments are not applied.

•Generally
Level 1

U.S. Agency
Securities

•Non-callable

agency-issued debt securities are generally valued
using quoted market prices, and callable agency-issued debt securities are valued by benchmarking model-derived prices to quoted market prices and trade data for comparable instruments.

•The fair value of agency mortgage pass-through pool securities is model-driven based on spreads of a comparable

to-be-announced

security.

•Collateralized
mortgage obligations are generally valued using quoted market prices and trade data adjusted by subsequent changes in related indices for comparable instruments.

•Level

agency-issued debt securities

•Generally Level 2—callable
agency-issued debt securities, agency mortgage pass-through pool securities and collateralized mortgage obligations

•Level 3—in instances where the inputs are unobservable

Other Sovereign
Government Obligations

•Fair value is determined using quoted prices in active markets when available.

•Generally
Level 1

•Level 2—if the market is less active or prices are dispersed

•Level 3—in instances where the inputs are unobservable

State and Municipal
Securities

•Fair value is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations or pricing models
that factor in, where applicable, interest rates, bond or CDS spreads and volatility and/or volatility skew, adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments.

•Generally
Level 2—if value based on observable market data for comparable instruments

Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (“RMBS”), Commercial
Mortgage-Backed Securities (“CMBS”) and other Asset-Backed Securities (“ABS’)

•RMBS, CMBS and
other ABS may be valued based on price or spread data obtained from observed transactions or independent external parties such as vendors or brokers.

•When position-specific external price data are not observable, the fair value determination may require benchmarking to
comparable instruments, and/or analyzing expected credit losses, default and recovery rates, and/or applying discounted cash flow techniques. When evaluating the comparable instruments for use in the valuation of each security, security
collateral-specific attributes, including payment priority, credit enhancement levels, type of collateral, delinquency rates and loss severity, are considered. In addition, for RMBS borrowers, Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”) scores and the
level of documentation for the loan are considered.

•Market standard models, such as Intex, Trepp or others, may be
deployed to model the specific collateral composition and cash flow structure of each transaction. Key inputs to these models are market spreads, forecasted credit losses, and default and prepayment rates for each asset category.

•Valuation levels of RMBS and CMBS indices are used as an additional data point for benchmarking purposes or to price
outright index positions.

•Generally Level 2—if value based on
observable market data for comparable instruments

•Level 3—if external prices or significant spread inputs are
unobservable or if the comparability assessment involves significant subjectivity related to property type differences, cash flows, performance and other inputs

Corporate Bonds

•Fair value is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations, bond spreads, CDS spreads, or at
the money volatility and/or volatility skew obtained from independent external parties, such as vendors and brokers, adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments.

•The spread data used are for the same maturity as the bond. If the spread data do not reference the issuer, then data that
reference a comparable issuer are used. When position-specific external price data are not observable, fair value is determined based on either benchmarking to comparable instruments or cash flow models with yield curves, bond or single name CDS
spreads and recovery rates as significant inputs.

•Level 2—if value based on observable market data for comparable instruments

•Level 3—in instances where prices or significant spread inputs are
unobservable

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Asset and Liability / Valuation Technique

Valuation Hierarchy Classification

Collateralized Debt
Obligations (“CDO”) and Collateralized Loan Obligations (“CLO”)

•The Firm holds cash CDOs/CLOs
that typically reference a tranche of an underlying synthetic portfolio of single name CDS spreads collateralized by corporate bonds (“credit-linked notes”) or cash portfolio of asset-backed securities/loans (“asset-backed
CDOs/CLOs”).

•Credit correlation, a primary input used to determine the fair value of credit-linked notes, is
usually unobservable and derived using a benchmarking technique. Other model inputs such as credit spreads, including collateral spreads, and interest rates are typically observable.

•Asset-backed CDOs/CLOs are valued based on an evaluation of the market and model input parameters sourced from comparable
instruments as indicated by market activity. Each asset-backed CDO/CLO position is evaluated independently taking into consideration available comparable market levels, underlying collateral performance and pricing, deal structures and
liquidity.

•Level 2—when
either comparable market transactions are observable or credit correlation input is insignificant

•Level 3—when
either comparable market transactions are unobservable or the credit correlation input is significant

Loans and Lending
Commitments

•Fair value of corporate loans is determined using recently executed transactions, market price
quotations (where observable), implied yields from comparable debt, market observable CDS spread levels obtained from independent external parties adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments, along with proprietary
valuation models and default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are unobservable.

•Fair value of
contingent corporate lending commitments is determined by using executed transactions on comparable loans and the anticipated market price based on pricing indications from syndicate banks and customers. The valuation of loans and lending
commitments also takes into account fee income that is considered an attribute of the contract.

•Fair value of mortgage
loans is determined using observable prices based on transactional data or third-party pricing for comparable instruments, when available.

•Where position-specific external prices are not observable, fair value is estimated based on benchmarking to prices and
rates observed in the primary market for similar loan or borrower types or based on the present value of expected future cash flows using its best estimates of the key assumptions, including forecasted credit losses, prepayment rates, forward yield
curves and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved or a methodology that utilizes the capital structure and credit spreads of recent comparable securitization transactions.

•Fair value of equity margin loans is determined by discounting future interest cash flows, net of estimated credit losses.
The estimated credit losses are derived by benchmarking to market observable CDS spreads, implied debt yields or volatility metrics of the loan collateral company.

•Level 2—if
value based on observable market data for comparable instruments

•Level 3—in instances where prices or significant
spread inputs are unobservable

Corporate
Equities

•Exchange-traded equity securities are generally valued based on quoted prices from the exchange. To the
extent these securities are actively traded, valuation adjustments are not applied.

•Unlisted equity securities are
generally valued based on an assessment of each underlying security, considering rounds of financing and third-party transactions, discounted cash flow analyses and market- based information, including comparable Firm transactions, trading multiples
and changes in market outlook, among other factors.

•Listed fund units are generally marked to the exchange-traded
price, while listed fund units if not actively traded and unlisted fund units are generally marked to Net Asset Value (“NAV”).

•Level
1—exchange-traded securities and fund units if actively traded

•Level 2—exchange-traded securities if not
actively traded or if undergoing a recent mergers and acquisitions event or corporate action

•Level 3—unlisted
equity securities and exchange-traded securities if not actively traded or if marked to an aged mergers and acquisitions event or corporate action

•Certain fund units that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share are not classified in the fair value
hierarchy

Listed Derivative Contracts

•Listed derivatives that are actively traded are valued based on quoted prices from the exchange.

•Listed derivatives that are not actively traded are valued using the same approaches as those applied to OTC
derivatives.

•Level 1—listed derivatives that are actively traded

•Level 2—listed derivatives that are not actively
traded

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Asset and Liability / Valuation Technique

Valuation Hierarchy Classification

OTC Derivative Contracts

•OTC derivative contracts include forward, swap and option contracts related to interest rates, foreign currencies, credit
standing of reference entities, equity prices or commodity prices.

•Depending on the product and the terms of the
transaction, the fair value of OTC derivative products can be modeled using a series of techniques, including closed-form analytic formulas, such as the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, simulation models or a combination thereof. Many pricing
models do not entail material subjectivity as the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant judgment, since model inputs may be observed from actively quoted markets, as is the case for generic interest rate swaps, many equity, commodity
and foreign currency option contracts, and certain CDS. In the case of more established derivative products, the pricing models used by the Firm are widely accepted by the financial services industry.

•More complex OTC derivative products are typically less liquid and require more judgment in the implementation of the
valuation technique since direct trading activity or quotes are unobservable. This includes certain types of interest rate derivatives with both volatility and correlation exposure, equity, commodity or foreign currency derivatives which are either
longer-dated or include exposure to multiple underlyings, and credit derivatives, including CDS on certain mortgage- or asset-backed securities and basket CDS. Where these inputs are unobservable, relationships to observable data points, based on
historic and/or implied observations, may be employed as a technique to estimate the model input values.

•For further
information on the valuation techniques for OTC derivative products, see Note 2.

•For further information on derivative
instruments and hedging activities, see Note 4.

•Generally Level
2—OTC derivative products valued using observable inputs, or where the unobservable input is not deemed significant.

•Level 3—OTC derivative products for which the unobservable input is deemed significant

Investments

•Investments include direct investments in equity securities, as well as various investment management funds, which include
investments made in connection with certain employee deferred compensation plans.

•Direct investments are presented in
the fair value hierarchy table as Principal investments and Other. Initially, the transaction price is generally considered by the Firm as the exit price and is its best estimate of fair value.

•After initial recognition, in determining the fair value of

non-exchange-traded

internally and externally managed funds, the Firm generally considers the NAV of the fund provided by the fund manager to be the best estimate of fair value. For

non-exchange-traded

investments either held
directly or held within internally managed funds, fair value after initial recognition is based on an assessment of each underlying investment, considering rounds of financing and third-party transactions, discounted cash flow analyses and
market-based information, including comparable Firm transactions, trading multiples and changes in market outlook, among other factors. Exchange-traded direct equity investments are generally valued based on quoted prices from the exchange.

•Level
1—exchange-traded direct equity investments in an active market

•Level

2—non-exchange-traded

direct equity investments and investments in various investment management funds if valued based on rounds of financing or third-party transactions; exchange-traded direct equity
investments if not actively traded

•Level

3—non-exchange-traded

direct
equity investments and investments in various investment management funds where rounds of financing or third-party transactions are not available

•Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.
For additional disclosure about such investments, see “Fair Value of Investments Measured at Net Asset Value” herein.

Physical Commodities

•The Firm trades various physical commodities, including natural gas and precious metals.

•Fair value is determined using observable inputs, including broker quotations and published indices.

•Generally Level 2 if value based on observable inputs

Investment Securities

AFS Securities

•AFS securities are composed of U.S. government and agency securities (

e.g.

, U.S. Treasury securities, agency-issued
debt, agency mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations), CMBS, Federal Family Education Loan Program (“FFELP”) student loan ABS, auto loan ABS, corporate bonds, CLOs and actively traded equity securities.

•For further information on the determination of fair value, refer to the corresponding asset/liability valuation technique

Certificates of Deposit

•The Firm issues Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured certificates of deposit that pay either
fixed coupons or that have repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, indices or currencies. The fair value of these certificates of deposit is determined using valuation models that incorporate observable inputs
referencing identical or comparable securities, including prices to which the deposits are linked, interest rate yield curves, option volatility and currency rates, equity prices, and the impact of the Firm’s own credit spreads, adjusted for
the impact of the FDIC insurance, which is based on vanilla deposit issuance rates.

•Generally Level 2

Short-Term Borrowings/Long-Term Borrowings

Structured Notes

•The Firm issues structured notes that have coupon or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity
securities, indices, currencies or commodities.

•Fair value of structured notes is determined using valuation models for
the derivative and debt portions of the notes. These models incorporate observable inputs referencing identical or comparable securities, including prices to which the notes are linked, interest rate yield curves, option volatility and currency
rates, and commodity or equity prices.

•Independent, external and traded prices for the notes are considered as well.
The impact of the Firm’s own credit spreads is also included based on observed secondary bond market spreads.

•Generally Level 2

•Level 3—in instances where the unobservable inputs are deemed significant

Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase

•Fair value is computed using a standard cash flow discounting methodology.

•The inputs to the valuation include contractual cash flows and collateral funding spreads, which are estimated using
various benchmarks, interest rate yield curves and option volatilities.

•Generally Level 2

•Level 3—in instances where the unobservable inputs are deemed significant

For trading purposes, the Firm holds or sells short equity securities issued by entities in diverse industries and of
varying sizes.

3.

For positions with the same counterparty that cross over the levels of the fair value hierarchy, both counterparty
netting and cash collateral netting are included in the column titled “Counterparty and Cash Collateral Netting.” For contracts with the same counterparty, counterparty netting among positions classified within the same level is included
within that shared level. For further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 4.

4.

Amounts exclude certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share, which are not classified in
the fair value hierarchy. For additional disclosure about such investments, see “Fair Value of Investments Measured at Net Asset Value” herein.

Changes in Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The following tables present additional information about Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis for 2016, 2015 and 2014. Level 3 instruments may be hedged with instruments classified in Level 1 and Level 2. As a result, the realized and unrealized gains (losses) for assets and liabilities
within the Level 3 category presented in the following tables do not reflect the related realized and unrealized gains (losses) on hedging instruments that have been classified by the Firm within the Level 1 and/or
Level 2 categories.

Additionally, both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair value of positions
that the Firm has classified within the Level 3 category. As a result, the unrealized gains (losses) during the period for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category presented in
the following tables herein may include changes in fair value during the period that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. Total realized and unrealized gains (losses) are primarily included in Trading revenues in the
consolidated income statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Significant Unobservable Inputs Used in Recurring Level 3 Fair Value Measurements

The following disclosures provide information on the valuation techniques, significant unobservable inputs, and their ranges and averages for
each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis with a significant Level 3 balance. The level of aggregation and breadth of products cause the range of inputs to be wide and not evenly distributed
across the inventory. Further, the range of unobservable inputs may differ across firms in the financial services industry because of diversity in the types of products included in each firm’s inventory. The following disclosures also include
qualitative information on the sensitivity of the fair value measurements to changes in the significant unobservable inputs. There are no predictable relationships between multiple significant unobservable inputs attributable to a given valuation
technique. A single amount is disclosed when there is no significant difference between the minimum, maximum and average (weighted average or simple average / median).

Credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”) and FVA are included in the balance but excluded from the Valuation
Technique(s) and Significant Unobservable Inputs in the previous table. CVA is a Level 3 input when the underlying counterparty credit curve is unobservable. FVA is a Level 3 input in its entirety given the lack of observability of funding
spreads in the principal market.

Significant Unobservable Inputs — Description

Sensitivity

Asset coverage—

The ratio of a borrower’s underlying pledged assets less applicable costs relative to their outstanding debt
(while considering the loan’s principal and the seniority and security of the loan commitment).

In general, an increase (decrease) to the asset coverage for an asset would result in a higher (lower) fair value.

Capitalization rate—

The ratio between net operating income produced by an asset and its market value at the projected disposition
date.

In general, an increase (decrease) to the capitalization rate for an asset would result in a lower (higher) fair value.

Cash synthetic basis—

The measure of the price differential between cash financial instruments and their synthetic derivative-based
equivalents. The range disclosed in the table above signifies the number of points by which the synthetic bond equivalent price is higher than the quoted price of the underlying cash bonds.

In general, an increase (decrease) to the cash synthetic basis for an asset would result in a lower (higher) fair value.

Comparable bond price—

A pricing input used when
prices for the identical instrument are not available. Significant subjectivity may be involved when fair value is determined using pricing data available for comparable instruments. Valuation using comparable instruments can be done by calculating
an implied yield (or spread over a liquid benchmark) from the price of a comparable bond, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to derive a value for the bond. The adjustment to yield (or spread) should account for relevant differences in the bonds
such as maturity or credit quality.

Alternatively, a

price-to-price

basis can be assumed between the comparable instrument and the bond being valued in order to establish the value of the bond. Additionally, as the probability of default increases for a given
bond (

i.e.

, as the bond becomes more distressed), the valuation of that bond will increasingly reflect its expected recovery level assuming default. The decision to use

price-to-price

or yield/spread comparisons largely reflects trading market convention for the financial instruments in question.

Price-to-price

comparisons are primarily employed for RMBS, CMBS, ABS, CDOs, CLOs, Other debt, interest rate contracts, foreign exchange contracts, Other secured financings and distressed corporate bonds.
Implied yield (or spread over a liquid benchmark) is utilized predominately for

non-distressed

corporate bonds, loans and credit contracts.

In general, an increase (decrease) to the comparable bond price for an asset would result in a higher (lower) fair value.

Comparable equity price—

A price derived from equity raises, share buybacks and external bid levels, etc. A discount or premium may
be included in the fair value estimate.

In general, an increase (decrease) to the comparable equity price of an asset would result in a higher (lower) fair
value.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Significant Unobservable Inputs—Description

Sensitivity

Correlation—

A pricing input where the payoff is driven by more than one underlying risk. Correlation is a measure of the
relationship between the movements of two variables (

i.e.

, how the change in one variable influences a change in the other variable). Credit correlation, for example, is the factor that describes the relationship between the probability of
individual entities to default on obligations and the joint probability of multiple entities to default on obligations.

In general, an increase (decrease) to the correlation would result in an impact to the fair value, but the magnitude and direction of the
impact would depend on whether the Firm is long or short the exposure.

Credit spread—

The difference in yield between different securities due to differences in credit quality. The credit spread
reflects the additional net yield an investor can earn from a security with more credit risk relative to one with less credit risk. The credit spread of a particular security is often quoted in relation to the yield on a credit

risk-free

benchmark security or reference rate, typically either U.S. Treasury or London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”).

In general, an increase (decrease) to the credit spread of an asset would result in a lower (higher) fair value.

EBITDA multiple / Exit multiple—

The ratio of the Enterprise Value to EBITDA, where the Enterprise Value is the aggregate value
of equity and debt minus cash and cash equivalents. The EBITDA multiple reflects the value of the company in terms of its

full-year

EBITDA, whereas the exit multiple reflects the value of the company in terms
of its full-year expected EBITDA at exit. Either multiple allows comparison between companies from an operational perspective as the effect of capital structure, taxation and depreciation/amortization is excluded.

In general, an increase (decrease) to the EBITDA or Exit multiple of an asset would result in a higher (lower) fair value.

Funding spread—

The difference between the general collateral rate (which refers to the rate applicable to a broad class of U.S.
Treasury issuances) and the specific collateral rate (which refers to the rate applicable to a specific type of security pledged as collateral, such as a municipal bond). Repurchase agreements and certain other secured financings are discounted
based on collateral curves. The curves are constructed as spreads over the corresponding overnight indexed swap (“OIS”) or LIBOR curves, with the short end of the curve representing spreads over the corresponding OIS curves and the long
end of the curve representing spreads over LIBOR.

In general, an increase (decrease) to the funding spread of an asset would result in a lower (higher) fair value.

Implied weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”)—

The WACC implied by the current value of equity in a discounted cash
flow model. The model assumes that the cash flow assumptions, including projections, are fully reflected in the current equity value, while the debt to equity ratio is held constant. The WACC theoretically represents the required rate of return to
debt and equity investors.

In general, an increase (decrease) to the Implied weighted cost of capital of an asset would result in a lower (higher) fair value.

Interest rate curve—

The term structure of interest rates (relationship between interest rates and the time to maturity) and a
market’s measure of future interest rates at the time of observation. An interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is a pricing input used in the discounting of any OTC derivative cash
flow.

In general, an increase (decrease) to the interest rate curve would result in an impact to the fair value, but the magnitude and direction
of the impact would depend on whether the Firm is long or short the exposure.

Volatility—

The measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument given how much that instrument changes in value
over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options, and, generally, the lower the volatility, the less risky the option. The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option depends on a number of factors, including the nature of
the risk underlying that option (

e.g.

, the volatility of a particular underlying equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular underlying commodity index), the tenor and the strike price of the option.

In general, an increase (decrease) to the volatility would result in an impact to the fair value, but the magnitude and direction of the
impact would depend on whether the Firm is long or short the exposure.

Volatility skew—

The measure of the difference in implied volatility for options with identical underliers and expiry dates but with
different strikes. The implied volatility for an option with a strike price that is above or below the current price of an underlying asset will typically deviate from the implied volatility for an option with a strike price equal to the current
price of that same underlying asset.

In general, an increase (decrease) to the volatility skew would result in an impact to the fair value, but the magnitude and direction of
the impact would depend on whether the Firm is long or short the exposure.

Restrictions.

Investments in hedge funds may be
subject to

lock-up

or gate provisions. A

lock-up

provision is a provision which provides that during a certain initial period, an investor may not make a withdrawal from
the fund. A gate provision restricts the amount of redemption that an investor can demand on any redemption date.

The remaining restriction period for these investments was primarily over three years.

The redemption notice periods for hedge funds were primarily greater than six months. Hedge fund investments representing approximately 20% of
the fair value cannot be redeemed as of December 31, 2016 because a gate provision has been imposed by the hedge fund manager primarily for indefinite periods.

Fair Value Option

The Firm elected the
fair value option for certain eligible instruments that are risk managed on a fair value basis to mitigate income statement volatility caused by measurement basis differences between the elected instruments and their associated risk management
transactions or to eliminate complexities of applying certain accounting models.

1.

Non-recurring

changes in the fair value of loans and lending commitments: held
for investment were calculated using the value of the underlying collateral; and held for sale were calculated using recently executed transactions, market price quotations, valuation models that incorporate market observable inputs where possible,
such as comparable loan or debt prices and credit default swap spread levels adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments, or default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are unobservable.

2.

Losses related to Other assets—Other investments were determined using techniques that included discounted cash
flow models, methodologies that incorporate multiples of certain comparable companies and recently executed transactions. Included in these losses was a loss of approximately $35 million in 2016 in connection with the sale of solar investments
and impairments of the remaining unsold solar investments accounted for under the equity method.

3.

Losses related to Other assets—Premises, equipment and software costs were determined using techniques that
included a default recovery analysis and recently executed transactions. Included in these losses was an impairment charge of approximately $31 million in 2016 in connection with an oil terminal facility to reduce the carrying value to its
estimated fair value less costs to sell.

4.

Losses related to Intangible assets were determined using techniques that included discounted cash flow models and
methodologies that incorporate multiples of certain comparable companies.

5.

Losses related to Other assets were determined primarily using a default recovery analysis.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Valuation Techniques for Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value

Asset and Liability / Valuation Technique

Securities purchased under agreements to resell/Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, Securities borrowed/Securities
loaned and Other secured financings

•Typically longer dated instruments for which the fair value is
determined using standard cash flow discounting methodology.

•The inputs to the valuation include contractual
cash flows and collateral funding spreads, which are estimated using various benchmarks and interest rate yield curves.

Investment securities—HTM securities

•Fair value is determined using quoted market prices.

Customer and other receivables

•For the portion of the customer and other receivables where fair value does not equal carrying value, the fair
value is determined using collateral information, historical resolution and recovery rates and employee termination data. The cash flow is then discounted using a market observable spread over LIBOR.

Loans

•The fair value of consumer and residential real estate loans and lending commitments where position-specific
external price data are not observable is determined based on the credit risks of the borrower using a probability of default and loss given default method, discounted at the estimated external cost of funding level.

•The fair value of corporate loans and lending commitments is determined using recently executed transactions,
market price quotations (where observable), implied yields from comparable debt, market observable credit default swap spread levels along with proprietary valuation models and default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are
unobservable.

Long-term borrowings

•The fair value is generally determined based on transactional data or third-party pricing for identical or
comparable instruments, when available. Where position-specific external prices are not observable, fair value is determined based on current interest rates and credit spreads for debt instruments with similar terms and maturity.

The carrying values of the remaining assets and liabilities not measured at fair value in the following tables approximate fair value due
to their short-term nature.

1.

Accrued interest, fees, and dividend receivables and payables where carrying value approximates fair value have been
excluded.

2.

Amounts include loans measured at fair value on a

non-recurring

basis.

At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, notional amounts of approximately
$97.4 billion and $99.5 billion, respectively, of the Firm’s lending commitments were held for investment and held for sale, which are not included in the previous table. The estimated fair value of such lending commitments was a
liability of $1,241 million and $2,172 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Had these commitments been accounted for at fair value, $973 million would have been categorized in Level 2 and
$268 million in Level 3 at December 31, 2016, and $1,791 million would have been categorized in Level 2 and $381 million in Level 3 at December 31, 2015.

The previous tables exclude certain financial instruments such as equity method investments and all

non-financial

assets and liabilities such as the value of the long-term relationships with the Firm’s deposit customers.

security indices, property indices, mortgage-related and other asset-backed securities, and real estate loan products. The Firm uses these instruments for market-making, foreign currency exposure management, and asset and liability management.

Amounts represent the netting of receivable balances with payable balances for the same counterparty across maturity
categories. Receivable and payable balances with the same counterparty in the same maturity category are netted within such maturity category, where appropriate. Cash collateral received is netted on a counterparty basis, provided legal right of
offset exists.

3.

Fair value is shown, net of collateral received (primarily cash and U.S. government and agency securities).

4.

Obligor credit ratings are determined internally by the Credit Risk Management Department.

Credit Risk-Related Contingencies

In connection with certain OTC trading agreements, the Firm may be required to provide
additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties in the event of a credit rating downgrade of the Firm.

The following table presents the aggregate fair value of certain derivative contracts that contain credit risk-related contingent features
that are in a net liability position for which the Firm has posted collateral in the normal course of business.

Credit Derivatives and Other Credit Contracts

The Firm enters into credit derivatives, principally through credit default swaps, under which it receives or provides protection against the
risk of default on a set of debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity or entities. A majority of the Firm’s counterparties for these derivatives are banks, broker-dealers, and insurance and other financial institutions.

For single name and

non-tranched

index and basket credit
default swaps, the Firm has purchased protection with a notional amount of approximately $389.2 billion and $577.7 billion at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, compared with a notional amount of approximately
$395.5 billion and $619.5 billion (included in the following tables) at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, of credit protection sold with identical underlying reference obligations.

The purchase of credit protection does not represent the sole manner in which the Firm risk manages its exposure to credit derivatives. The
Firm manages its exposure to these derivative contracts through a variety of risk mitigation strategies, which include managing the credit and correlation risk across single name,

non-tranched

indices and
baskets, tranched indices and baskets, and cash positions. Aggregate market risk limits have been established for credit derivatives, and market risk measures are routinely monitored against these limits. The Firm may also recover amounts on the
underlying reference obligation delivered to the Firm under credit default swaps where credit protection was sold.

1.

Fair value amounts are shown on a gross basis prior to cash collateral or counterparty netting.

2.

In order to provide an indication of the current payment status or performance risk of the CDS, a breakdown of CDS
based on the Firm’s internal credit ratings by investment grade and

non-investment

grade is provided. Internal credit ratings serve as the Credit Risk Management Department’s assessment of credit
risk and the basis for a comprehensive credit limits framework used to control credit risk. The Firm uses quantitative models and judgment to estimate the various risk parameters related to each obligor.

Single Name Credit Default Swaps

A credit default swap protects the buyer against the loss of principal on a bond or loan in case of a default by the issuer. The protection
buyer pays a periodic premium (generally quarterly) over the life of the contract and is protected for the period. The Firm, in turn, performs under a credit default swap if a credit event as defined under the contract occurs. Typical credit events
include bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay and restructuring of the obligations of the referenced entity.

Index and Basket Credit Default Swaps

Index and basket credit default swaps are products where credit protection is provided on a portfolio of single name credit default swaps.
Generally, in the event of a default on

one of the underlying names, the Firm pays a pro rata portion of the total notional amount of the credit default swap.

The Firm also enters into tranched index and basket credit default swaps where credit protection is provided on a particular portion of the
portfolio loss distribution. The most junior tranches cover initial defaults, and once losses exceed the notional of the tranche, they are passed on to the next most senior tranche in the capital structure.

Credit Protection Sold through CLNs and CDOs

The Firm has invested in credit-linked notes (“CLNs”) and CDOs, which are hybrid instruments containing embedded derivatives, in
which credit protection has been sold to the issuer of the note. If there is a credit event of a reference entity underlying the instrument, the principal balance of the note may not be repaid in full to the Firm.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The Firm believes there are no securities in an unrealized loss position that are
other-than-temporarily-impaired at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for the reasons discussed herein.

For AFS debt
securities, the Firm does not intend to sell the securities and is not likely to be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of amortized cost basis. For AFS and HTM debt securities, the securities have not experienced credit losses as the
net unrealized losses reported in the previous table are primarily due to higher interest rates since those securities were purchased.

Additionally, the Firm does not expect to experience a credit loss based on consideration of the relevant information (as discussed in Note
2), including for U.S. government and agency securities, the existence of an explicit and implicit guarantee provided by the U.S. government. The risk of credit loss on securities in an unrealized loss position is considered minimal because the
Firm’s agency securities, as well as ABS, CMBS and CLOs, are highly rated and because corporate bonds are all investment grade.

For
AFS equity securities, the Firm has the intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.

See Note 13 for additional information on securities issued by VIEs, including U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities,

non-agency

CMBS, auto loan ABS, CLO and FFELP student loan ABS.

6. Collateralized Transactions

The Firm enters into securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed and
securities loaned transactions to, among other things, acquire securities to cover short positions and settle other securities obligations, to accommodate customers’ needs and to finance its inventory positions.

The Firm manages credit exposure arising from such transactions by, in appropriate circumstances, entering into master netting agreements and
collateral agreements with counterparties that provide the Firm, in the event of a counterparty default (such as bankruptcy or a counterparty’s failure to pay or perform), with the right to net a counterparty’s rights and obligations under
such agreement and liquidate and set off collateral held by the Firm against the net amount owed by the counterparty.

The Firm’s
policy is generally to take possession of securities purchased or borrowed in connection with securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed transactions, respectively, and to receive cash and securities delivered under
securities sold under agreements to repurchase or securities loaned transactions (with rights of rehypothecation). In certain cases, the Firm may be permitted to post collateral to a third-party custodian under a

tri-party

arrangement that enables the Firm to take control of such collateral in the event of a counterparty default.

The Firm also monitors the fair value of the underlying securities as compared with the related receivable or payable, including accrued
interest, and, as necessary, requests additional collateral as provided under the applicable agreement to ensure such transactions are adequately collateralized or the return of excess collateral.

The risk related to a decline in the market value of collateral (pledged or received) is managed by setting appropriate market-based haircuts.
Increases in collateral margin calls on secured financing due to market value declines may be mitigated by increases in collateral margin calls on securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed transactions with similar
quality collateral. Additionally, the Firm may request lower quality collateral pledged be replaced

with higher quality collateral through collateral substitution rights in the underlying agreements.

The Firm actively manages its secured financing in a manner that reduces the potential refinancing risk of secured financing for less liquid
assets. The Firm considers the quality of collateral when negotiating collateral eligibility with counterparties, as defined by its fundability criteria. The Firm utilizes shorter-term secured financing for highly liquid assets and has established
longer tenor limits for less liquid assets, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Trading Assets Pledged

The Firm pledges its trading assets to collateralize securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities loaned and other secured
financings. Pledged financial instruments that can be sold or repledged by the secured party are identified as Trading assets (pledged to various parties) in the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
carrying value of Trading assets that have been loaned or pledged to counterparties, where those counterparties do not have the right to sell or repledge the collateral, was $41.4 billion and $35.0 billion, respectively.

Collateral Received

The Firm receives
collateral in the form of securities in connection with securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities borrowed and derivative transactions, customer margin loans and securities-based lending. In many cases, the Firm is permitted to
sell or repledge these securities held as collateral and use the securities to secure securities sold under agreements to repurchase, to enter into securities lending and derivative transactions or for delivery to counterparties to cover short
positions.

The Firm additionally receives securities as collateral in connection with certain

securities-for-securities

transactions. In instances where the Firm is the lender and permitted to sell or repledge these securities, it reports the fair value of the collateral received and the related
obligation to return the collateral included in Trading assets and Trading liabilities, respectively, in its consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the total fair value of financial instruments received as
collateral where the Firm is permitted to sell or repledge the securities was $561.2 billion and $522.6 billion, respectively, and the fair value of the portion that had been sold or repledged was $430.9 billion and
$398.1 billion, respectively.

Concentration Risk

The Firm is subject to concentration risk by holding large positions in certain types of securities, loans or commitments to purchase
securities of a single issuer, including sovereign governments and other entities, issuers located in a particular country or geographic area, public and private issuers involving developing countries or issuers engaged in a particular industry.

Trading assets owned by the Firm include U.S. government and agency securities and securities issued by other sovereign governments
(principally the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Brazil and Japan), which, in the aggregate, represented approximately 8% and 7% of the Firm’s total assets at

December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition, substantially all of the collateral held by the Firm for resale agreements or bonds borrowed, which together
represented approximately 18% and 15% of the Firm’s total assets at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, consists of securities issued by the U.S. government, federal agencies or other sovereign government
obligations.

Positions taken and commitments made by the Firm, including positions taken and underwriting and financing commitments made
in connection with its private equity, principal investment and lending activities, often involve substantial amounts and significant exposure to individual issuers and businesses, including

non-investment

grade issuers. In addition, the Firm may originate and/or purchase certain residential and commercial mortgage loans that could contain certain terms and features that may result in additional credit risk as compared with more traditional types of
mortgages. Such terms and features may include loans made to borrowers subject to payment increases or loans with high

loan-to-value

ratios.

Customer Margin Lending

The Firm
engages in margin lending to clients that allows the client to borrow against the value of qualifying securities. Margin loans are included within Customer and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets. Under these agreements and
transactions, the Firm receives collateral, including U.S. government and agency securities, other sovereign government obligations, corporate and other debt, and corporate equities. Customer receivables generated from margin lending activities are
collateralized by customer-owned securities held by the Firm. The Firm monitors required margin levels and established credit terms daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions,
when necessary.

Margin loans are extended on a demand basis and are not committed facilities. Factors considered in the review of margin
loans are the amount of the loan, the intended purpose, the degree of leverage being employed in the account, and overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification or, in the case of concentrated positions, appropriate liquidity
of the underlying collateral or potential hedging strategies to reduce risk.

Underlying collateral for margin loans is reviewed with
respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, valuation of securities, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations. For these transactions, adherence to the Firm’s collateral
policies significantly limits its credit exposure in the event of a customer default. The Firm may request additional margin collateral from customers, if appropriate, and, if necessary,

December 2016 Form 10-K



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

may sell securities that have not been paid for or purchase securities sold but not delivered from customers. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the amounts related to margin
lending were approximately $24.4 billion and $25.3 billion, respectively.

Other secured financings include the liabilities
related to transfers of financial assets that are accounted for as financings rather than sales, consolidated VIEs where the Firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, and certain equity-linked notes (“ELN”) and other secured
borrowings. These liabilities are generally payable from the cash flows of the related assets accounted for as Trading assets (see Notes 11 and 13).

7. Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses

Loans

The Firm’s loan portfolio consists of the following:

•

Corporate

.    Corporate loans primarily include commercial and industrial lending
used for general corporate purposes, working capital and liquidity, event-driven loans and asset-backed lending products. Event-driven loans support client merger, acquisition, recapitalization, or project finance activities. Corporate loans are
structured as revolving lines of credit, letter of credit facilities, term loans and bridge loans. Risk factors considered in determining the allowance for corporate loans include the borrower’s financial strength, seniority of the loan,
collateral type, volatility of collateral value, debt cushion, covenants and counterparty type.

•

Consumer

.    Consumer loans include unsecured loans and securities-based lending
that allows clients to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities for any suitable purpose other than purchasing, trading, or carrying securities or refinancing margin debt. The majority of

consumer loans are structured as revolving lines of credit and letter of credit facilities and are primarily offered through the Firm’s Portfolio Loan Account (“PLA”) and Liquidity
Access Line (“LAL”) programs. The allowance methodology for unsecured loans considers the specific attributes of the loan as well as the borrower’s source of repayment. The allowance methodology for securities-based lending considers
the collateral type underlying the loan (

e.g.

, diversified securities, concentrated securities or restricted stock).

•

Residential Real Estate

.    Residential real estate loans mainly include

non-conforming

loans and home equity lines of credit. The allowance methodology for

non-conforming

residential mortgage loans considers several factors, including, but not
limited to,

loan-to-value

ratio, FICO score, home price index and delinquency status. The methodology for home equity lines of credit considers credit limits and
utilization rates in addition to the factors considered for

non-conforming

residential mortgages.

•

Wholesale Real Estate

.    Wholesale real estate loans include owner-occupied loans
and income-producing loans. The principal risk factors for determining the allowance for wholesale real estate loans are the underlying collateral type,

loan-to-value

ratio and debt service ratio.

Credit Quality

The Credit Risk
Management Department evaluates new obligors before credit transactions are initially approved and at least annually thereafter for corporate and wholesale real estate loans. For corporate loans, credit evaluations typically involve the
evaluation of financial statements; assessment of leverage, liquidity, capital strength, asset composition and quality; market capitalization and access to capital markets; cash flow projections and debt service requirements; and the adequacy of
collateral, if applicable. The Credit Risk Management Department also evaluates strategy, market position, industry dynamics, obligor’s management and other factors that could affect an obligor’s risk profile. For wholesale real
estate loans, the credit evaluation is focused on property and transaction metrics, including property type,

loan-to-value

ratio, occupancy levels, debt service ratio,
prevailing capitalization rates and market dynamics. For residential real estate and consumer loans, the initial credit evaluation typically includes, but is not limited to, review of the obligor’s income, net worth, liquidity, collateral,

loan-to-value

ratio and credit bureau information. Subsequent credit monitoring for residential real estate loans is performed at the portfolio level. Consumer loan collateral
values are monitored on an ongoing basis.

The Firm utilizes the following credit quality indicators, which are consistent with U.S.
banking regulators’ definitions of criticized exposures, in its credit monitoring process for loans held for investment:

•

Pass

.    A credit exposure rated pass has a continued expectation of timely
repayment, all obligations of the borrower are current, and the obligor complies with material terms and conditions of the lending agreement.

•

Special Mention

.    Extensions of credit that have potential weakness that deserve
management’s close attention and, if left uncorrected, may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects or collateral position.

•

Substandard

.    Obligor has a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the repayment
of the debt and has a high probability of payment default with the distinct possibility that

the Firm will sustain some loss if noted deficiencies are not corrected.

•

Doubtful

.    Inherent weakness in the exposure makes the collection or repayment in
full, based on existing facts, conditions and circumstances, highly improbable, and the amount of loss is uncertain.

•

Loss

.    Extensions of credit classified as loss are considered uncollectible and
are charged off.

Loans considered as doubtful or loss are considered impaired. Substandard loans are regularly reviewed
for impairment. When a loan is impaired, the impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, the observable market price of the loan
or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. For further information, see Note 2.

1.

At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no allowance was recorded for these loans as the present value of
the expected future cash flows (or, alternatively, the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral held) equaled or exceeded the carrying value.

2.

The impaired loans unpaid principal balance differs from the aggregate amount of impaired loan balances with and
without allowance due to various factors, including charge-offs and net deferred loan fees or costs.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Troubled Debt Restructurings

At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the impaired loans and lending commitments classified as held for investment include
troubled debt restructurings of $67.4 million and $44.0 million related to loans, respectively, and $13.9 million and $34.8 million related to lending commitments, respectively, within corporate loans. At December 31, 2016
the Firm did not record an allowance related to these troubled debt restructurings. At December 31, 2015, an allowance of $5.1 million was recorded. These restructurings typically include modifications of interest rates, collateral
requirements, other loan covenants and payment extensions.

Employee Loans

Employee loans are granted in conjunction with a program established in the Wealth Management business segment to retain and recruit certain
employees. These loans are recorded in Customer and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets. These loans are full recourse, generally require periodic payments and have repayment terms ranging from 1 to 12 years. The Firm establishes an
allowance for loan amounts it does not consider recoverable, which is recorded in Compensation and benefits expense. At December 31, 2016, the Firm had $4,715 million of employee loans, net of an allowance of approximately
$89 million. At December 31, 2015, the Firm had $4,923 million of employee loans, net of an allowance of approximately $108 million.

Amounts include an increase of approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2016 to the carrying amount of
certain of the long-term borrowings associated with fair value hedges. The increase to the carrying value associated with fair value hedges by year due was approximately $0.2 billion due in 2017, $0.2 billion due in 2018, $0.3 billion
due in 2019, $0.3 billion due in 2020, $0.2 billion due in 2021 and ($0.1) billion due thereafter.

Variable rate borrowings bear interest based on a variety of money market indices, including LIBOR and federal funds
rates. Amounts include borrowings that are linked to equity, credit, commodity or other indices.

3.

Amounts include a decrease of approximately $0.7 billion at December 31, 2016 to the carrying amounts of
certain of the long-term borrowings for which the fair value option was elected (see Note 3).

4.

non-U.S.

interest rates and excludes financial instruments for which the fair value option was elected. Virtually all of the variable rate notes issued by subsidiaries are carried at fair value so a weighted average coupon is not meaningful.

During 2016 and 2015, the Firm issued notes with a principal amount of approximately $43.6 billion and
$34.2 billion, respectively, and approximately $30.4 billion and $27.3 billion, respectively, in aggregate long-term borrowings matured or retired.

Certain senior debt securities are denominated in various

non-U.S.

dollar currencies and may be
structured to provide a return that is linked to equity, credit, commodity or other indices (

e.g.

, the consumer price index). Senior debt also may be structured to be callable by the Firm or extendible at the option of holders of the senior
debt securities.

Debt containing provisions that effectively allow the holders to put the notes aggregated $3,156 million at
December 31, 2016 and $2,902 million at December 31, 2015. In addition, in certain circumstances, certain purchasers may be entitled to cause the repurchase of the notes. The aggregated value of notes subject to these arrangements was
$1,117 million at December 31, 2016 and $650 million at December 31, 2015. Subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures generally are issued to meet the capital requirements of the Firm or

its regulated subsidiaries and primarily are U.S. dollar denominated.

The weighted
average maturity of long-term borrowings, based upon stated maturity dates, was approximately 5.9 years and 6.1 years at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Trust Preferred Securities

During 2016, Morgan Stanley Capital Trust III, Morgan Stanley Capital Trust IV, Morgan Stanley Capital Trust V and Morgan Stanley Capital
Trust VIII redeemed all of their issued and outstanding Capital Securities pursuant to the optional redemption provisions provided in the respective governing documents. In the aggregate, $2.8 billion was redeemed. The Firm concurrently
redeemed the related underlying junior subordinated debentures.

During 2015, Morgan Stanley Capital Trusts VI and VII redeemed all of
their issued and outstanding 6.60% Capital Securities, respectively, and the Firm concurrently redeemed the related underlying junior subordinated debentures.

Senior Debt—Structured Borrowings

The Firm’s index-linked, equity-linked or credit-linked borrowings include various structured instruments whose payments and redemption
values are linked to the performance of a specific index (

e.g.,

Standard & Poor’s 500), a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures. To minimize the exposure from such
instruments, the Firm has entered into various swap

December 2016 Form 10-K



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

contracts and purchased options that effectively convert the borrowing costs into floating rates based upon LIBOR. The Firm generally carries the entire structured borrowings at fair value. The
swaps and purchased options used to economically hedge the embedded features are derivatives and also are carried at fair value. Changes in fair value related to the notes and economic hedges are reported in Trading revenues. See Note 3 for further
information on structured borrowings.

Subordinated Debt

Subordinated notes included in long-term borrowings have a contractual weighted average coupon of 4.5% at both December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. Maturities of subordinated notes range from 2022 to 2027.

Asset and Liability Management

In general, other than securities inventories financed by secured funding sources, the majority of the Firm’s assets are financed with a
combination of deposits, short-term funding, floating rate long-term debt or fixed rate long-term debt swapped to a floating rate. The Firm uses interest rate swaps to more closely match these borrowings to the duration, holding period and interest
rate characteristics of the assets being funded and to manage interest rate risk. These swaps effectively convert certain of the Firm’s fixed rate borrowings into floating rate obligations. In addition, for

non-U.S.

dollar currency borrowings that are not used to fund assets in the same currency, the Firm has entered into currency swaps that effectively convert the borrowings into U.S. dollar obligations.

The Firm’s use of swaps for asset and liability management affected its effective average borrowing rate.

which $68.8 billion settled within three business days.

Types of Commitments

Letters of Credit and Other Financial Guarantees.

The Firm has outstanding letters of credit and other financial
guarantees issued by third-party banks to certain of the Firm’s counterparties. The Firm is contingently liable for these letters of credit and other financial guarantees, which

are primarily used to provide collateral for securities and commodities borrowed and to satisfy various margin requirements in lieu of depositing cash or securities with these counterparties.

Investment Activities

.

The Firm sponsors several

non-consolidated

investment management funds for third-party investors where it typically acts as general partner of, and investment advisor to, these funds and typically commits to invest a minority of the
capital of such funds, with subscribing third-party investors contributing the majority. The Firm’s employees, including its senior officers as well as the Firm’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), may participate on the same
terms and conditions as other investors in certain of these funds that the Firm sponsors primarily for client investment, except that the Firm may waive or lower applicable fees and charges for its employees. The Firm has contractual capital
commitments, guarantees and counterparty arrangements with respect to these investment management funds.

Lending
Commitments

.

Lending commitments represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for different types of loan transactions. For syndications led by the Firm, the lending
commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed are net of the amounts agreed to by counterparties that will participate in the syndication. For syndications that the Firm participates in and does not lead, lending commitments accepted by
the borrower but not yet closed include only the amount that the Firm expects it will be allocated from the lead syndicate bank. Due to the nature of the Firm’s obligations under the commitments, these amounts include certain commitments
participated to third parties. See Note 7 for further information.

Forward-Starting Secured Financing
Receivables

.

The Firm has entered into forward-starting securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed (agreements that have a trade date at or prior to December 31, 2016 and settle
subsequent to

period-end)

that are primarily secured by collateral from U.S. government agency securities and other sovereign government obligations.

Underwriting Commitments

.

The Firm provides underwriting commitments in connection with its capital
raising sources to a diverse group of corporate and other institutional clients.

December 2016 Form 10-K


Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The Firm has obligations under certain guarantee arrangements, including contracts and
indemnification agreements, that contingently require the Firm to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying measure (such as an interest or foreign exchange rate, security or commodity price, an index, or the occurrence
or

non-occurrence

of a specified event) related to an asset, liability or equity security of a guaranteed party. Also included as guarantees are contracts that contingently require the Firm to make payments to
the guaranteed party based on another entity’s failure to perform under an agreement, as well as indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others.

Types of Guarantees

Derivative Contracts.

Certain derivative contracts meet the accounting definition of a guarantee,
including certain written options, contingent forward contracts and credit default swaps (see Note 4 regarding credit derivatives in which the Firm has sold credit protection to the counterparty). The Firm has disclosed information regarding all
derivative contracts that could meet the accounting definition of a guarantee and has used the notional amount as the maximum potential payout for certain derivative contracts, such as written interest rate caps and written foreign currency options.

In certain situations, collateral may be held by the Firm for those contracts that meet the definition of a guarantee. Generally, the
Firm sets collateral requirements by counterparty so that the collateral covers various transactions and products and is not allocated specifically to individual contracts. Also, the Firm may recover amounts related to the underlying asset delivered
to the Firm under the derivative contract.

The Firm records derivative contracts at fair value. Aggregate market risk limits have been
established, and market risk measures are routinely monitored against these limits. The Firm also manages its exposure to these derivative contracts through a variety of risk mitigation strategies, including, but not limited to, entering into
offsetting economic hedge positions. The Firm believes that the notional amounts of the derivative contracts generally overstate its exposure.

Standby Letters of Credit and Other Financial Guarantees Issued.

In connection with its corporate lending
business and other corporate activities, the Firm provides standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees to counterparties. Such arrangements represent obligations to make payments to third parties if the counterparty fails to fulfill its
obligation under a borrowing arrangement or other contractual obligation. A majority of the Firm’s standby letters of credit are provided on behalf of counterparties that are investment grade.

Market Value Guarantees.

Market value guarantees are issued to
guarantee timely payment of a specified return to investors in certain affordable housing tax credit funds. These guarantees are designed to return an investor’s contribution to a fund and the investor’s share of tax losses and tax credits
expected to be generated by a fund. From time to time, the Firm may also guarantee return of principal invested, potentially including a specified rate of return, to fund investors.

Liquidity Facilities.

The Firm has entered into liquidity facilities with special purpose entities
(“SPEs”) and other counterparties, whereby the Firm is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. Primarily, the Firm acts as liquidity provider to municipal bond securitization SPEs and for standalone municipal bonds
in which the holders of beneficial interests issued by these SPEs or the holders of the individual bonds, respectively, have the right to tender their interests for purchase by the Firm on specified dates at a specified price. The Firm often may
have recourse to the underlying assets held by the SPEs in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities, as well as make-whole or recourse provisions with the trust sponsors. Primarily all of the underlying assets in the SPEs are
investment grade. Liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives.

Whole Loan Sales
Guarantees

.

The Firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain whole loan sales. Under certain circumstances, the Firm may be required to
repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. The Firm maximum potential payout related to such representations and warranties is equal to the current unpaid principal
balance (“UPB”) of such loans. The Firm has information on the current UPB only when it services the loans. The amount included in the previous table for the maximum potential payout of $23.3 billion includes the current UPB when
known of $4.4 billion and the UPB at the time of sale of $18.9 billion when the current UPB is not known. The UPB at the time of the sale of all loans covered by these representations and warranties was approximately
$42.7 billion. The related liability primarily relates to sales of loans to the federal mortgage agencies.

Securitization
Representations and Warranties.

As part of the Firm’s Institutional Securities business segment’s securitization and related activities, the Firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible
for, representations and warranties regarding certain assets transferred in securitization transactions sponsored by the Firm. The extent and nature of the representations and warranties, if any, vary among different securitizations. Under certain
circumstances, the Firm may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Firm could be required to make would be equal to the current
outstanding balances of, or losses associated with, the assets subject to breaches of such representations and warranties. The amount included in the previous table for the maximum potential payout includes the current UPB where known and
the UPB at the time of sale when the current UPB is not known.

At December 31, 2016, there were approximately
$147.9 billion of outstanding RMBS primarily containing U.S. residential loans that the Firm had sponsored between 2004 and 2016. Of that amount, the Firm made representations and warranties relating to approximately $47.0 billion of loans
and agreed to be responsible for the representations and warranties made by third-party sellers, many of which are now insolvent, on approximately $21.0 billion of loans. At December 31, 2016, the Firm had reserved $103 million in its
consolidated financial statements for payments owed as a result of breach of representations and warranties made in connection with these residential mortgages. At December 31, 2016, the current UPB for all the residential assets subject
to such representations and warranties was approximately $11.6 billion, and the cumulative losses associated with U.S. RMBS were approximately $15.2 billion. The Firm did not make, or otherwise agree to be responsible for, the
representations and warranties made by third-party sellers on approximately $79.9 billion of residential loans that it securitized during that time period.

The Firm also made representations and warranties in connection with its role as an originator of certain commercial mortgage loans that it
securitized in CMBS. At December 31, 2016, there were outstanding Firm sponsored CMBS in which the Firm had originated and placed between 2004 and 2016, U.S. and

non-U.S.

commercial mortgage loans of
approximately $37.3 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2016, the Firm had not accrued any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for payments owed as a result of breach of representations and warranties
made in connection with these commercial mortgages. At December 31, 2016, the current UPB for all U.S. commercial mortgage loans subject to such representations and warranties was $31.7 billion. For the

non-U.S.

commercial mortgage loans, the amount included in the previous table for the maximum potential payout includes the current UPB when known of $0.8 billion and the UPB at the time of sale of
$0.4 billion when the current UPB is not known.

General Partner Guarantees.

As a general partner in
certain investment management funds, the Firm receives certain distributions from the partnerships related to achieving certain return hurdles according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Firm may be required to

return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements, subject
to certain limitations.

Other Guarantees and Indemnities

In the normal course of business, the Firm provides guarantees and indemnifications in a variety of transactions. These provisions generally
are standard contractual terms. Certain of these guarantees and indemnifications related to indemnities, exchange/clearinghouse member guarantees and merger and acquisition guarantees are described below:

•

Indemnities.

The Firm provides standard indemnities to counterparties for
certain contingent exposures and taxes, including U.S. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest and other payments made on derivatives, securities and stock lending transactions, certain annuity products and other financial arrangements. These
indemnity payments could be required based on a change in the tax laws, a change in interpretation of applicable tax rulings or a change in factual circumstances. Certain contracts contain provisions that enable the Firm to terminate the agreement
upon the occurrence of such events. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Firm could be required to make under these indemnifications cannot be estimated.

•

Exchange/Clearinghouse Member Guarantees.

The Firm is a member of various U.S.
and

non-U.S.

exchanges and clearinghouses that trade and clear securities and/or derivative contracts. Associated with its membership, the Firm may be required to pay a certain amount as determined by the
exchange or the clearinghouse in case of a default of any of its members or pay a proportionate share of the financial obligations of another member that may default on its obligations to the exchange or the clearinghouse. While the rules governing
different exchange or clearinghouse memberships and the forms of these guarantees may vary, in general the Firm’s obligations under these rules would arise only if the exchange or clearinghouse had previously exhausted its resources.

In addition, some clearinghouse rules require members to assume a proportionate share of losses
resulting from the clearinghouse’s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, and of other losses unrelated to the default of a clearing member, if such losses exceed the specified resources allocated for such purpose by the
clearinghouse.

The maximum potential payout under these rules cannot be estimated. The Firm has not recorded any
contingent liability in its consolidated financial statements for these agreements and believes that any potential requirement to make payments under these agreements is remote.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

•

Merger and Acquisition Guarantees.

The Firm may, from time to time, in its role
as investment banking advisor be required to provide guarantees in connection with certain European merger and acquisition transactions. If required by the regulating authorities, the Firm provides a guarantee that the acquirer in the merger and
acquisition transaction has or will have sufficient funds to complete the transaction and would then be required to make the acquisition payments in the event the acquirer’s funds are insufficient at the completion date of the transaction.
These arrangements generally cover the time frame from the transaction offer date to its closing date and, therefore, are generally short term in nature. The Firm believes the likelihood of any payment by the Firm under these arrangements is remote
given the level of its due diligence with its role as investment banking advisor.

In addition, in the ordinary course
of business, the Firm guarantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations (including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. These guarantees
generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties. The activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the
consolidated financial statements.

Contingencies

Legal

.    In the normal course of business, the Firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various
legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for
substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress. These actions have
included, but are not limited to, residential mortgage and credit-crisis related matters.

Over the last several years, the level of
litigation and investigatory activity (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies has increased materially in the financial services industry. As a result, the Firm expects that it will continue to be the subject of
elevated claims for damages and other relief and, while the Firm has identified below any individual proceedings where the Firm believes a material loss to be reasonably possible and reasonably estimable, there can be no assurance that material
losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be probable or possible and reasonably estimable losses.

The Firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter.
Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the Firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the Firm accrues the estimated loss by a
charge to income. The Firm incurred legal expenses of $263 million in 2016, $563 million in 2015 and $3,364 million in 2014. The Firm’s future legal expenses may fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment
regarding government investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the Firm.

In many
proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. In addition, even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess
of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss.

For certain legal proceedings and investigations, the Firm cannot reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings and
investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or governmental entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved,
including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal
questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question, before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation.

For certain other legal proceedings and investigations, the Firm can estimate reasonably possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or
ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued, but does not believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that such losses will have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial statements
as a whole, other than the matters referred to in the following paragraphs.

On May 3,
2013, plaintiffs in

Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftsbank AG et al. v. Morgan Stanley et al.

material misrepresentations and omissions in the sale to plaintiffs of certain mortgage pass-through certificates backed by securitization trusts containing residential mortgage loans. The total amount of certificates allegedly sponsored,
underwritten and/or sold by the Firm to plaintiff was approximately $644 million. The complaint alleges causes of action against the Firm for common law fraud, fraudulent concealment, aiding and abetting fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and
rescission and seeks, among other things, compensatory and punitive damages. On June 10, 2014, the court granted in part and denied in part the Firm’s motion to dismiss the complaint. The Firm perfected its appeal from that decision on

market value at the time of a judgment against the Firm, or upon sale, plus

pre-

and post-judgment interest, fees and costs. The Firm may be entitled to be indemnified for some of these losses.

Variable Interest Entities and Securitization Activities

Overview

The Firm is involved with various SPEs in the normal course of business. In most cases, these entities are deemed to be VIEs.

The Firm’s variable interests in VIEs include debt and equity interests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments and certain
fees. The Firm’s involvement with VIEs arises primarily from:

•

Interests purchased in connection with market-making activities, securities held in its Investment securities
portfolio and retained interests held as a result of securitization activities, including

re-securitization

transactions.

•

Guarantees issued and residual interests retained in connection with municipal bond securitizations.

•

Loans made to and investments in VIEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.

•

Derivatives entered into with VIEs.

•

Structuring of CLNs or other asset-repackaged notes designed to meet the investment objectives of clients.

•

Other structured transactions designed to provide

tax-efficient

yields
to the Firm or its clients.

The Firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE upon its initial
involvement with the VIE and reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the VIE. This determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the VIE, including the
VIE’s structure and activities, the power to make significant economic decisions held by the Firm and by other parties, and the variable interests owned by the Firm and other parties.

The power to make the most significant economic decisions may take a number of different forms in different types of VIEs. The Firm considers
servicing or collateral management decisions as representing the power to make the most significant economic decisions in transactions such as securitizations or CDOs. As a result, the Firm does not consolidate

securitizations or CDOs for which it does not act as the servicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain other rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager or to require the
liquidation of the entity. If the Firm serves as servicer or collateral manager, or has certain other rights described in the previous sentence, the Firm analyzes the interests in the VIE that it holds and consolidates only those VIEs for which it
holds a potentially significant interest of the VIE.

The structure of securitization vehicles and CDOs is driven by several parties,
including loan seller(s) in securitization transactions, the collateral manager in a CDO, one or more rating agencies, a financial guarantor in some transactions and the underwriter(s) of the transactions, that serve to reflect specific investor
demand. In addition, subordinate investors, such as the

“B-piece”

buyer (

i.e.,

investors in most subordinated bond classes) in commercial mortgage-backed securitizations or equity investors in
CDOs, can influence whether specific loans are excluded from a CMBS transaction or investment criteria in a CDO.

For many transactions,
such as

re-securitization

transactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaged notes, there are no significant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. In these cases, the Firm focuses its analysis on decisions
made prior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the termination of the transaction. Based upon factors, which include an analysis of the nature of the assets, including whether the assets were issued in a transaction sponsored by the
Firm and the extent of the information available to the Firm and to investors, the number, nature and involvement of investors, other rights held by the Firm and investors, the standardization of the legal documentation and the level of continuing
involvement by the Firm, including the amount and type of interests owned by the Firm and by other investors, the Firm concluded in most of these transactions that decisions made prior to the initial closing were shared between the Firm and the
initial investors. The Firm focused its control decision on any right held by the Firm or investors related to the termination of the VIE. Most

re-securitization

transactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaged
notes have no such termination rights.

Consolidated VIEs

Except for consolidated VIEs included in other structured financings and managed real estate partnerships in the tables below, the Firm
accounts for the assets held by the entities primarily in Trading assets and the liabilities of the entities in Other secured financings in its consolidated balance sheets. For consolidated VIEs included in other structured financings, the Firm
accounts for the assets held by the entities primarily in Premises, equipment and software costs, and

December 2016 Form 10-K



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Other assets in its consolidated balance sheets. For consolidated VIEs included in managed real estate partnerships, the Firm accounts for the assets held by the entities primarily in Trading
assets in its consolidated balance sheets. Except for consolidated VIEs included in other structured financings, the assets and liabilities are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected in earnings.

As part of the Institutional Securities business segment’s securitization and related activities, the Firm has provided, or otherwise
agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain assets transferred in securitization transactions sponsored by the Firm (see Note 12).

As a result of adopting the accounting update

Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis

on January 1, 2016, certain consolidated
entities are now considered VIEs and are included in the balances at December 31, 2016. See Note 2 for further information.

1.

Asset-backed securitizations include transactions backed by residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans and
other types of assets, including consumer or commercial assets. The value of assets is determined based on the fair value of the liabilities of and the interests owned by the Firm in such VIEs because the fair values for the liabilities and
interests owned are more observable.

2.

Other primarily includes certain operating entities, investment funds and structured transactions.

Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities are presented in the previous tables after intercompany eliminations.
The assets owned by many consolidated VIEs cannot be removed unilaterally by the Firm and are not generally available to the Firm. The related liabilities issued by many consolidated VIEs are

non-recourse

to
the Firm. In certain other consolidated VIEs, the Firm either has the unilateral right to remove assets or provide additional recourse through derivatives such as total return swaps, guarantees or other forms of involvement.

In general, the Firm’s exposure to loss in consolidated VIEs is limited to losses that would be absorbed on the VIE’s net assets
recognized in its financial statements, net of amounts absorbed by third-party variable interest holders. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements related to consolidated
VIEs were $228 million and $37 million, respectively. The Firm also had additional maximum exposure to losses of approximately $78 million and $72 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively,
primarily related to certain derivatives, commitments, guarantees and other forms of involvement.

Non-consolidated

VIEs

The following tables include all VIEs in which the Firm has determined that its maximum exposure to loss is greater than specific thresholds
or meets certain other criteria and exclude exposure to loss from liabilities due to immateriality. Most of the VIEs included in the following tables are sponsored by unrelated parties; the Firm’s involvement generally is the result of its
secondary market-making activities, securities held in its Investment securities portfolio (see Note 5) and certain investments in funds.

The Firm’s maximum exposure to loss often differs from the carrying value of the variable interests held
by the Firm. The maximum exposure to loss is dependent on the nature of the

Firm’s variable interest in the VIEs and is limited to the notional amounts of certain liquidity facilities, other credit support, total return swaps, written put options, and the fair value
of certain other derivatives and investments the Firm has made in the VIEs. Liabilities issued by VIEs generally are

non-recourse

to the Firm. Where notional amounts are utilized in quantifying maximum
exposure related to derivatives, such amounts do not reflect fair value write-downs already recorded by the Firm.

The Firm’s maximum
exposure to loss does not include the offsetting benefit of any financial instruments that the Firm may utilize to hedge these risks associated with its variable interests. In addition, the Firm’s maximum exposure to loss is not reduced by the
amount of collateral held as part of a transaction with the VIE or any party to the VIE directly against a specific exposure to loss.

December 2016 Form 10-K



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Securitization transactions generally involve VIEs. Primarily as a result of its secondary
market-making activities, the Firm owned additional VIE assets mainly issued by securitization SPEs for which the maximum exposure to loss is less than specific thresholds. These additional assets totaled $11.7 billion and $12.9 billion at
December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These assets were either retained in connection with transfers of assets by the Firm, acquired in connection with secondary market-making activities or held as AFS securities in its
Investment securities portfolio (see Note 5) or held as investments in funds. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, these assets consisted of securities backed by residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans or other
consumer loans, such as credit card receivables, automobile loans and student loans, CDOs or CLOs, and investment funds. The Firm’s primary risk exposure is to the securities issued by the SPE owned by the Firm, with the risk highest on the
most subordinate class of beneficial interests. These assets generally are included in Trading assets—Corporate and other debt, Trading assets—Investments or AFS securities within its Investment securities portfolio and are measured at
fair value (see Note 3). The Firm does not provide additional support in these transactions through contractual facilities, such as liquidity facilities, guarantees or similar derivatives. The Firm’s maximum exposure to loss generally equals
the fair value of the assets owned.

Securitization Activities

In a securitization transaction, the Firm transfers assets (generally commercial or residential mortgage loans or U.S. agency securities) to
an SPE, sells to investors most of the beneficial interests, such as notes or certificates, issued by the SPE, and, in many cases, retains other beneficial interests. In many securitization transactions involving commercial mortgage loans, the Firm
transfers a portion of the assets to the SPE with unrelated parties transferring the remaining assets.

The purchase of the transferred
assets by the SPE is financed through the sale of these interests. In some of these transactions, primarily involving residential mortgage loans in the U.S., the Firm serves as servicer for some or all of the transferred loans. In many
securitizations, particularly involving residential mortgage loans, the Firm also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps or interest rate caps, with the SPE.

Although not obligated, the Firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by SPEs in these transactions. As a market maker, the Firm
offers to buy these securities from, and sell these securities to, investors. Securities purchased through these market-making activities are not considered to be retained interests, although these beneficial interests generally are included in
Trading assets—Corporate and other debt and are measured at fair value.

The Firm enters into derivatives, generally interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, with a
senior payment priority in many securitization transactions. The risks associated with these and similar derivatives with SPEs are essentially the same as similar derivatives with

non-SPE

counterparties and
are managed as part of the Firm’s overall exposure. See Note 4 for further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities.

Available for Sale Securities

In
the AFS securities within the Investment securities portfolio, the Firm holds securities issued by VIEs not sponsored by the Firm. These securities include government-guaranteed securities issued in transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage
agencies and the most senior securities issued by VIEs in which the securities are backed by student loans, automobile loans, commercial mortgage loans or CLOs (see Note 5).

Municipal Tender Option Bond Trusts

In a municipal tender option bond transaction, the Firm, generally on behalf of a client, transfers a municipal bond to a trust. The trust
issues short-term securities that the Firm, as the remarketing agent, sells to investors. The client retains a residual interest. The short-term securities are supported by a liquidity facility pursuant to which the investors may put their
short-term interests. In some programs, the Firm provides this liquidity facility; in most programs, a third-party provider will provide such liquidity facility. The Firm may purchase short-term securities in its role either as remarketing agent or
as liquidity provider. The client can generally terminate the transaction at any time. The liquidity provider can generally terminate the transaction upon the occurrence of certain events. When the transaction is terminated, the municipal bond is
generally sold or returned to the client. Any losses suffered by the liquidity provider upon the sale of the bond are the responsibility of the client. This obligation generally is collateralized. Liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender
option bond trusts are classified as derivatives. The Firm consolidates any municipal tender option bond trusts in which it holds the residual interest.

Credit Protection Purchased through CLNs

In a CLN transaction, the Firm transfers assets (generally high-quality securities or money market investments) to an SPE, enters into a
derivative transaction in which the SPE writes protection on an unrelated reference asset or group of assets, through a credit default swap, a total return swap or similar instrument, and sells to investors the securities issued by the SPE. In some
transactions, the Firm may also enter into interest rate or currency swaps with the SPE. Upon the


December 2016 Form 10-K


Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

occurrence of a credit event related to the reference asset, the SPE will deliver collateral securities as payment to the Firm. The Firm is generally exposed to price changes on the collateral
securities in the event of a credit event and subsequent sale. These transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain credit risk on the reference asset. In some transactions, the assets and liabilities of the SPE are
recognized in the Firm’s consolidated balance sheets. In other transactions, the transfer of the collateral securities is accounted for as a sale of assets, and the SPE is not consolidated. The structure of the transaction determines the
accounting treatment.

The derivatives in CLN transactions consist of total return swaps, credit default swaps or similar contracts in
which the Firm has purchased protection on a reference asset or group of assets. Payments by the SPE are collateralized. The risks associated with these and similar derivatives with SPEs are essentially the same as similar derivatives with

non-SPE

counterparties and are managed as part of the Firm’s overall exposure.

Other Structured Financings

The Firm primarily invests in equity interests issued by entities that develop and own

low-income

communities (including

low-income

housing projects) and entities that construct and own facilities that will generate energy from renewable resources. The
equity interests entitle the Firm to its share of tax credits and tax losses generated by these projects. In addition, the Firm has issued guarantees to investors in certain

low-income

housing funds. The
guarantees are designed to return an investor’s contribution to a fund and the investor’s share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by the fund. The Firm is also involved with entities designed to provide

tax-efficient

yields to the Firm or its clients.

Collateralized Loan and Debt Obligations

A CLO or a CDO is an SPE that purchases a pool of assets, consisting of corporate loans, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities or synthetic
exposures on similar assets through derivatives, and issues multiple tranches of debt and equity securities to investors. The Firm underwrites the securities issued in CLO transactions on behalf of unaffiliated sponsors and provides advisory
services to these unaffiliated sponsors. The Firm sells corporate loans to many of these SPEs, in some cases representing a significant portion of the total assets purchased. If necessary, the Firm may retain unsold securities issued in these
transactions. Although not obligated, the Firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by SPEs in these transactions. These beneficial interests are included in Trading assets and are measured at fair value.

Equity-Linked Notes

In an ELN transaction, the Firm typically transfers to an SPE either (1) a note issued by the Firm, the payments on which are linked to
the performance of a specific equity security, equity index, or other index or (2) debt securities issued by other companies and a derivative contract, the terms of which will relate to the performance of a specific equity security, equity
index or other index. These transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain risks related to the specific equity security, equity index or other index. ELN transactions with SPEs were not consolidated at December 31,
2016 and December 31, 2015.

Transactions with SPEs in which the Firm, acting as principal, transferred financial assets with
continuing involvement and received sales treatment are shown below.

14. Regulatory Requirements

Regulatory Capital Framework

The Firm
is a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and is subject to the regulation and oversight of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The Federal Reserve
establishes capital requirements for the Firm, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates the Firm’s compliance with such capital requirements. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency establishes similar capital requirements and
standards for the Firm’s U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. The regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and also implement certain provisions of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Regulatory Capital Requirements

The Firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage capital ratios under the regulatory capital requirements. A summary of the
calculations of regulatory capital, risk-weighted assets (“RWAs”) and transition provisions follows.

Regulatory Capital

Minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital. Certain adjustments to
and deductions from capital are required for purposes of determining these ratios, such as goodwill, intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, other amounts in AOCI and investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions.
Certain of these adjustments and deductions are also subject to transitional provisions.

In addition to the minimum risk-based capital
ratio requirements, on a fully

phased-in

basis by 2019, the Firm will be subject to:

•

A greater than 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer;

•

The Common Equity Tier 1 global systemically important bank capital surcharge, currently at 3%; and

•

Up to a 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 countercyclical capital buffer, currently set by banking regulators at zero
(collectively, the “buffers”).

In 2016, the

phase-in

amount for each
of the buffers is 25% of the fully

phased-in

buffer requirement. Failure to maintain the buffers will result in restrictions on the Firm’s ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of
dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.

Risk-Weighted Assets

RWAs reflect both the Firm’s

on-

and

off-balance

sheet
risk, as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following:

•

Credit risk: The failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to the Firm;

•

Market risk: Adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities,
correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and

•

Operational risk: Inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or from external events
(

e.g.

, fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets).

The Firm’s
binding risk-based capital ratios for regulatory purposes are the lower of the capital ratios computed under the (i) standardized approaches for calculating credit risk RWAs and market risk RWAs (the “Standardized Approach”) and
(ii) applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs (the “Advanced Approach”).

The methods for calculating each of the Firm’s risk-based capital ratios will change through January 1, 2022 as aspects of the
capital rules are phased in. These changes may result in differences in the Firm’s reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the next that are independent of changes to its capital base, asset composition,

off-balance

sheet exposures or risk profile.

intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, certain investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions and other adjustments.

U.S. Bank Subsidiaries’ Regulatory Capital and Capital Ratios

The Firm’s U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are subject to similar regulatory capital requirements as the Firm. Failure to meet minimum capital
requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries’ financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the
regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, each of the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain

off-balance

sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.

Each U.S. depository institution subsidiary of the Firm must be
well-capitalized in order for the Firm to continue to

qualify as a financial holding company and to continue to engage in the broadest range of financial activities permitted for financial holding companies. Under regulatory capital
requirements adopted by the U.S. federal banking agencies, U.S. depository institutions must maintain certain minimum capital ratios in order to be considered well-capitalized. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Firm’s
U.S. Bank Subsidiaries maintained capital at levels sufficiently in excess of the universally mandated well-capitalized requirements to address any additional capital needs and requirements identified by the U.S. federal banking regulators.

At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries’ binding ratios are based on the Standardized
Approach transitional rules.

Dividends and Share Repurchases

The Firm repurchased approximately $3,500 million of its outstanding common stock as part of its share repurchase program during 2016,
and the Firm repurchased approximately $2,125 million during 2015.

In June 2016, the Firm received a conditional

non-objection

from the Federal Reserve to its 2016 capital plan. The capital plan included a share repurchase of up to $3.5 billion of the Firm’s outstanding common stock during the period beginning
July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017. Additionally, the capital plan included an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.20 per share from $0.15 per share during the period beginning with the dividend declared on July 20,
2016.

Pursuant to the share repurchase program, the Firm considers, among other things, business segment capital needs as well as
stock-based compensation and benefit plan requirements. Share repurchases under the program will be exercised from time to time at prices the Firm deems appropriate subject to various factors, including the Firm’s capital position and market
conditions. The share repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule

10b5-1

plans, and may be suspended at any time. Share repurchases by
the Firm are subject to regulatory approval.

Employee Stock Trusts

The Firm has established Employee stock trusts to provide common stock voting rights to certain employees who hold outstanding RSUs. The
assets of the Employee stock trusts are consolidated with those of the Firm, and the value of the stock held in the Employee stock trusts is classified in Morgan Stanley shareholders’ equity and generally accounted for in a manner similar to
treasury stock.

Preferred Stock

Dividends declared on the Firm’s outstanding preferred stock were $468 million, $452 million and $311 million in 2016,
2015 and 2014, respectively. On December 15, 2016, the Firm announced that the Board declared quarterly dividends for preferred stock shareholders of record on December 30, 2016 that were paid on January 17, 2017. The Firm is
authorized to issue 30 million shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock has a preference over the common stock upon liquidation. The Firm’s preferred stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital in accordance with regulatory capital
requirements (see Note 14).

Series K Preferred Stock.

In January 2017, the Firm issued 40,000,000 Depositary Shares, for an
aggregate price of $1,000 million. Each Depositary Share represents a 1/1,000th interest in a share of

Fixed-to-Floating

Rate

Non-Cumulative

Preferred Stock, Series K, $0.01 par value (“Series K Preferred Stock”). The Series K Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Firm’s option, (i) in whole or in part, from time
to time, on any dividend payment date on or after April 15, 2027 or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time

within 90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event (as described in the terms of that series), in each case at a redemption price of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per Depositary
Share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. The Series K Preferred Stock also has a preference over the Firm’s common stock upon liquidation.
The Series K Preferred Stock offering (net of related issuance costs) resulted in proceeds of approximately $969 million.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments

Cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments include gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements
from their respective functional currencies to U.S. dollars, net of hedge gains or losses and related tax effects. The Firm uses foreign currency contracts to manage the currency exposure relating to its net investments in

non-U.S.

dollar functional currency subsidiaries. Increases or decreases in the value of net foreign investments generally are tax deferred for U.S. purposes, but the related hedge gains and losses are taxable
currently. The Firm may elect not to hedge its net investments in certain foreign operations due to market conditions or other reasons, including the availability of various currency contracts at acceptable costs. Information at December 31,
2016 and December 31, 2015 relating to the effects on cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments that resulted from the translation of foreign currency financial statements and from gains and losses from hedges of the Firm’s net
investments in

non-U.S.

dollar functional currency subsidiaries is summarized in the following table.

Interests

Noncontrolling interests were $1,127 million and $1,002 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively. The increase in noncontrolling interests was primarily due to the consolidation of certain investment management funds sponsored by the Firm and the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 for

December 2016 Form 10-K


Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $381 million,
$369 million and $404 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

At December 31, 2016, the Firm had $619 million
of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards. Absent forfeitures or cancellations, this amount of unrecognized compensation cost will be recognized as $415 million in 2017, $175 million in 2018 and
$29 million thereafter. These amounts do not include 2016 performance year awards granted in January 2017, which will begin to be amortized in 2017 (see “2016 Performance Year Deferred Compensation Awards” herein).

In connection with awards under its stock-based compensation plans, the Firm is authorized to issue shares of its common stock held in
treasury or newly issued shares. At December 31, 2016, approximately 103 million shares were available for future grants under these plans.

The Firm generally uses treasury shares, if available, to deliver shares to employees and has an ongoing repurchase authorization that
includes repurchases in connection with awards granted under its stock-based compensation plans. Share repurchases by the Firm are subject to regulatory approval. See Note 15 for additional information on the Firm’s share repurchase program.

Restricted Stock Units

RSUs are
generally subject to vesting over time, generally three years from the date of grant, contingent upon continued employment and subject to restrictions on sale, transfer or assignment until conversion to common stock. All or a portion of an award may
be canceled if employment is terminated before the end of the relevant vesting period and after the relevant vesting period in certain situations. Recipients of RSUs may have voting rights, at the Firm’s discretion, and generally receive
dividend equivalents.

The aggregate fair value of awards that vested during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $1,088 million, $1,693 million and
$1,517 million, respectively.

Stock Options

Stock options generally have an exercise price not less than the fair value of the Firm’s common stock on the date of grant, vest and
become exercisable over a three-year period and expire five to 10 years from the date of grant, subject to accelerated expiration upon certain terminations of employment. Stock options have vesting, restriction and cancellation provisions that are
generally similar to those of RSUs.

No stock options were granted during 2016, 2015 or 2014.

The Firm’s expected option life has been determined based upon historical experience. The expected stock price volatility assumption was
determined using the implied volatility of exchange-traded options, in accordance with accounting guidance for share-based payments. The risk-free interest rate was determined based on the yields available on U.S. Treasury

zero-coupon

issues.

Performance-Based Stock Units

PSUs will vest and convert to shares of common stock at the end of the performance period only if the Firm satisfies predetermined performance
and market-based conditions over the three-year performance period that began on January 1 of the grant year and ends three years later on December 31. Under the terms of the award, the number of PSUs that will actually vest and convert to
shares will be based on the extent to which the Firm achieves the specified performance goals during the performance period. PSUs have vesting, restriction and cancellation provisions that are generally similar to those of RSUs.

One-half

of the award will be earned based on the Firm’s average return on equity, excluding the
impact of DVA, certain gains or losses associated with the sale of specified businesses, specified goodwill impairments, certain gains or losses associated with specified legal settlements related to business activities conducted prior to
January 1, 2011 and specified cumulative

catch-up

adjustments resulting from

changes in an existing, or application of a new accounting principle that are not applied on a fully retrospective basis (“MS Adjusted Average ROE”). The number of PSUs ultimately

19. Employee Benefit Plans

The Firm sponsors various retirement plans for the majority of its U.S. and

non-U.S.

employees. The
Firm provides certain other postretirement benefits, primarily health care and life insurance, to eligible U.S. employees.

Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans

Substantially all of the U.S. employees of the Firm and its U.S. affiliates who were hired before July 1,
2007 are covered by the U.S. pension plan, a

non-contributory,

defined benefit pension plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “U.S. Qualified Plan”). The
U.S. Qualified Plan has ceased future benefit accruals.

Unfunded supplementary plans (the “Supplemental Plans”) cover certain
executives. Liabilities for benefits payable under the Supplemental Plans are accrued by the Firm and are funded when paid. The Morgan Stanley Supplemental Executive Retirement and Excess Plan (the “SEREP”), a

non-contributory

defined benefit plan that is not qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, ceased future benefit accruals after September 30, 2014. Any benefits earned under the SEREP prior
to October 1, 2014 will be payable in the future based on the SEREP’s provisions. The amendment did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Certain of the Firm’s

non-U.S.

subsidiaries also have defined benefit pension plans covering
substantially all of their employees.

The Firm’s pension plans generally provide pension benefits that are based on each
employee’s years of credited service and on compensation levels specified in the plans.

The Firm has an unfunded postretirement
benefit plan that provides medical and life insurance for eligible U.S. retirees and medical insurance for their dependents. The Morgan Stanley Medical Plan was amended to change the health care plans offered after December 31, 2014 for retirees who
are Medicare-eligible and age 65 or older. The amendment did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

The Firm generally amortizes into net periodic benefit expense (income) the unrecognized net
gains and losses exceeding 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. The amortization of the unrecognized net gains and losses is generally over the future service of active participants. The
U.S. Qualified Plan and, effective October 1, 2014, the SEREP amortize the unrecognized net gains and losses over the average life expectancy of participants.

The accounting for pension and postretirement plans involves certain assumptions and estimates. The expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets is a long-term assumption that generally is expected to remain the same from one year to the next unless there is a significant change in the target asset allocation, the fees and expenses paid by the plan or
market conditions. The expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. Qualified Plan was estimated by computing a weighted average of the underlying long-term expected returns based on the investment managers’ target allocations. The U.S.
Qualified Plan is primarily invested in fixed income securities and related derivative instruments, including interest rate swap contracts. This asset allocation is expected to help protect the plan’s funded status and limit volatility of the
Firm’s contributions. Total U.S. Qualified Plan investment portfolio performance is assessed by comparing actual investment performance to changes in the estimated present value of the U.S. Qualified Plan’s benefit obligation.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all
defined benefit pension plans was $3,696 million and $3,592 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

The discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans were selected by the Firm, in
consultation with its independent actuaries, using a pension discount yield curve based on the characteristics of the plans, each determined independently. The pension discount yield curve represents spot discount yields based on duration implicit
in a representative broad-based Aa rated corporate bond universe of high-quality fixed income investments. For all

non-U.S.

pension plans, the Firm set the assumed discount rates based on the nature of
liabilities, local economic environments and available bond indices.

Meaningful

Plan Assets

The U.S. Qualified Plan
assets represent 88% of the Firm’s total pension plan assets. The U.S. Qualified Plan uses a combination of active and risk-controlled fixed income investment strategies. The fixed income asset allocation consists primarily of fixed income
securities and related derivative instruments designed to approximate the expected cash flows of the plan’s liabilities in order to help reduce plan exposure to interest rate variation and to better align assets with the obligation. The
longer-duration fixed income allocation is expected to help protect the plan’s funded status and maintain the stability of plan contributions over the long run.

Derivative instruments are permitted in the U.S. Qualified Plan’s investment portfolio only to the extent that they comply with all of
the plan’s investment policy guidelines and are consistent with the plan’s risk and return objectives. In addition, any investment in derivatives must meet the following conditions:

•

May be used only if derivative instruments are deemed by the investment manager to be more attractive than a
similar direct investment in the underlying cash market or if the vehicle is being used to manage risk of the portfolio.

•

May not be used in a speculative manner or to leverage the portfolio under any circumstances.

•

May not be used as short-term trading vehicles. The investment philosophy of the U.S. Qualified Plan is that
investment activity is undertaken for long-term investment rather than short-term trading.

•

May be used in the management of the U.S. Qualified Plan’s portfolio only when the derivative
instruments’ possible effects can be quantified, shown to enhance the risk-return profile of the portfolio, and reported in a meaningful and understandable manner.


December 2016 Form 10-K


Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

As a fundamental operating principle, any restrictions on the underlying assets apply to a
respective derivative product. This includes percentage allocations and credit quality. Derivatives are used solely for the purpose of enhancing investment in the underlying assets and not to circumvent portfolio restrictions.

Plan assets are measured at fair value using valuation techniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques applied to the Firm’s
major categories of assets and liabilities as described in Notes 2 and 3. OTC derivative contracts consist of investments in interest rate swaps.

Other investments consist of pledged insurance annuity contracts held by non-U.S.-based plans. The pledged insurance annuity contracts are
valued based on the premium reserve of the insurer for a guarantee that the insurer has given to the employee benefit plan that approximates fair value. The pledged insurance annuity contracts are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Commingled trust funds are privately offered funds that are regulated, supervised and subject to periodic examination by a U.S. federal
or state agency and available to institutional clients. The trust must be maintained for the collective investment or reinvestment of assets contributed to it from U.S.

tax-qualified

employee benefit plans maintained by more than one employer or controlled group of corporations. The sponsor of the commingled trust funds
values the funds based on the fair value of the underlying securities. The underlying securities of the commingled trust funds held by the U.S. Qualified Plan consist mainly of long-duration fixed income instruments. Commingled trust funds are
redeemable at NAV at the measurement date or in the near future.

Some

non-U.S.-based

plans hold
foreign funds that consist of investments in fixed income funds, target cash flow funds and liquidity funds. Fixed income funds invest in individual securities quoted on a recognized stock exchange or traded in a regulated market. Certain fixed
income funds aim to produce returns consistent with certain Financial Times Stock Exchange indexes. Target cash flow funds are designed to provide a series of fixed annual cash flows achieved by investing in government bonds and derivatives.
Liquidity funds place a high priority on capital preservation, stable value and a high liquidity of assets. Foreign funds are readily redeemable at NAV.

The Firm generally considers the NAV of commingled trust funds and foreign funds provided by the fund manager to be the best estimate of fair
value.

Morgan Stanley 401(k) Plan

U.S. employees meeting certain eligibility requirements may participate in the Morgan Stanley 401(k) Plan. Eligible U.S. employees receive
discretionary 401(k) matching cash contributions as determined annually by the Firm. For 2016 and 2015, the Firm made a $1 for $1 Firm match up to 4% of eligible pay, up to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) limit. Matching contributions
for 2016 and 2015 were invested according to each participant’s investment direction. Eligible U.S. employees with eligible pay less than or equal to $100,000 also received a fixed contribution under the 401(k) Plan that equaled 2% of eligible
pay. Transition contributions are allocated to certain eligible employees. The Firm match, fixed contribution and transition contribution are included in the Firm’s 401(k) expense. The Firm’s 401(k) expense for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was
$250 million, $255 million and $256 million, respectively.

Defined Contribution Pension Plans

The Firm maintains separate defined contribution pension plans that cover substantially all employees of certain

non-U.S.

subsidiaries. Under such plans, benefits are determined based on a fixed rate of base salary with certain vesting requirements. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Firm’s expense related to these plans was
$101 million, $111 million and $117 million, respectively.

The Firm’s effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2016 included net discrete tax benefits of
$68 million. These net discrete tax benefits were primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination, partially offset by adjustments for
other tax matters. Excluding these net discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2016 would have been 31.6%.

The Firm’s effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2015 included net discrete tax benefits of $564 million. These net
discrete tax benefits were primarily associated with the repatriation of

non-U.S.

earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated due to an internal restructuring to simplify the Firm’s legal entity
organization in the U.K. Excluding these net discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2015 would have been 32.5%.

The Firm’s effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2014 included net discrete tax benefits of $2,226 million. These net
discrete tax benefits consisted of: $1,380 million primarily due to the release of a deferred tax liability, previously established as part of the acquisition of Smith Barney in 2009 through a charge to Additional

paid-in

capital, as a result of the legal entity restructuring that included a change in tax status of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Holdings LLC from a partnership to a corporation; $609 million
principally associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination; and $237 million primarily associated with the repatriation of

non-U.S.

earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated. Excluding these net discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2014 would have been 59.5%,

which is primarily attributable to approximately $900 million of tax provision from

non-deductible

expenses for litigation and regulatory matters.

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse.

The Firm had tax credit carryforwards for which a related deferred tax asset of $465 million and
$1,647 million was recorded at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These carryforwards are subject to annual limitations on utilization, with the earliest expiration beginning in 2030, if not utilized.

The Firm believes the recognized net deferred tax asset (after valuation allowance) of $4,767 million at December 31, 2016 is more
likely than not to be realized based on expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which it operates.

The Firm had
$12,006 million and $10,209 million of cumulative earnings at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, attributable to foreign subsidiaries for which no U.S. provision has been recorded for income tax


December 2016 Form 10-K


Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

that could occur upon repatriation. Accordingly, $1,111 million and $893 million of deferred tax liabilities were not recorded with respect to these earnings at December 31, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively. The increase in indefinitely reinvested earnings is attributable to regulatory and other capital requirements in foreign jurisdictions.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

The total
amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $1.9 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Of this total, approximately
$1.1 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively (net of federal benefit of state issues, competent authority and foreign tax credit offsets), represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would
favorably affect the effective tax rate in future periods.

Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as
provision for income taxes. The Firm recognized $28 million, $18 million and $(35) million of interest expense (benefit) (net of federal and state income tax benefits) in the consolidated income statements for 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. Interest expense accrued at December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was approximately $150 million, $122 million and $258 million, respectively, net of federal and state income tax
benefits. Penalties

related to unrecognized tax benefits for the years mentioned above were immaterial.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Tax Authority Examinations

The Firm is under continuous examination by the IRS and other tax authorities in certain countries, such as Japan and the U.K., and in states
in which it has significant business operations, such as New York. The Firm is currently at various levels of field examination with respect to audits by the IRS, as well as New York State and New York City, for tax years 2009-2012 and 2007-2013,
respectively. The Firm believes that the resolution of these tax matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated balance sheets, although a resolution could have a material impact on the consolidated income statements for a particular
future period and the effective tax rate for any period in which such resolution occurs.

In April 2016, the Firm received a notification
from the IRS that the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation approved the final report of an Appeals Office review of matters from tax years 1999-2005, and the Revenue Agent’s Report reflecting agreed closure of the 2006-2008 tax years. The
Firm has reserved the right to contest certain items, associated with tax years 1999-2005, the resolution of which is not expected to have a material impact on the effective tax rate or the consolidated financial statements.

During 2017, the Firm expects to reach a conclusion with the U.K. tax authorities on substantially all issues through tax year 2010, the
resolution of which is not expected to have a material impact on the effective tax rate or the consolidated financial statements.

The
Firm has established a liability for unrecognized tax benefits that it believes is adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, the Firm adjusts liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits only when new
information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change.

The Firm periodically evaluates the likelihood of assessments in
each taxing jurisdiction resulting from the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations or new information regarding the status of current and subsequent years’ examinations. As part of the Firm’s periodic review, federal and state
unrecognized tax benefits were released or remeasured.

It is reasonably possible that significant changes in the balance of unrecognized
tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months related to certain tax authority examinations referred to herein. At this time, however, it is not possible to

reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the impact on the Firm’s effective tax rate over the next 12 months.

Segment Information

The Firm structures
its segments primarily based upon the nature of the financial products and services provided to customers and its management organization. The Firm provides a wide range of financial products and services to its customers in each of the business
segments: Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management. For a further discussion of the business segments, see Note 1.

Revenues and expenses directly associated with each respective business segment are included in determining its operating results. Other
revenues and expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular business segment are allocated based upon the Firm’s allocation methodologies, generally based on each business segment’s respective net revenues,

non-interest

expenses or other relevant measures.

As a result of revenues and expenses from
transactions with other operating segments being treated as transactions with external parties, the Firm includes an Intersegment Eliminations category to reconcile the business segment results to the consolidated results.

Guarantees

In the normal course of its business, the Parent Company guarantees certain of its subsidiaries’ obligations under derivative and other
financial arrangements. The Parent Company records Trading assets and Trading liabilities, which include derivative contracts, at fair value on its condensed balance sheets.

The Parent Company also, in the normal course of its business, provides standard indemnities to counterparties on behalf of its subsidiaries
for taxes, including U.S. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest and other payments made on derivatives, securities and stock lending transactions, and certain annuity products. These indemnity payments could be required based on a change in the
tax laws or change in interpretation of applicable tax rulings. Certain contracts contain provisions that enable the Parent Company to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of such events. The maximum

potential amount of future payments that the Parent Company could be required to make under these indemnifications cannot be estimated. The Parent Company has not recorded any contingent
liability in its condensed financial statements for these indemnifications and believes that the occurrence of any events that would trigger payments under these contracts is remote.

The Parent Company has issued guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries to various U.S. and

non-U.S.

exchanges and clearinghouses that trade and clear securities and/or futures contracts. Under these guarantee arrangements, the Parent Company may be required to pay the financial obligations of its subsidiaries related to business transacted on or
with the exchanges and clearinghouses in the event of a subsidiary’s default on its obligations to the exchange or the clearinghouse. The Parent Company has not recorded any contingent liability in its condensed financial statements for these
arrangements and believes that any potential requirements to make payments under these arrangements are remote.

The Parent Company
guarantees certain debt instruments and warrants issued by subsidiaries. The debt instruments and warrants totaled $11.5 billion and $9.1 billion at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In connection with
subsidiary lease obligations, the Parent Company has issued guarantees to various lessors. The Parent Company had $1.1 billion of guarantees outstanding under subsidiary lease obligations, primarily in the U.K. at both December 31, 2016
and December 31, 2015.

Finance Subsidiary

In 2016, in accordance with the early adoption of a provision of the accounting update

Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

, unrealized DVA gains (losses) are recorded within OCI and, when realized, in Trading revenues. In 2015, the realized and unrealized DVA gains (losses) were recorded in Trading revenues.

2.

The fourth quarter of 2016 included net discrete tax benefits of $135 million, primarily related to the
remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination (see Note 20).

3.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, net revenues included losses of approximately $60 million on sales and
markdowns of legacy limited partnership investments in third-party-sponsored funds within the Investment Management business segment. The fourth quarter of 2016 also included a $70 million provision within the Wealth Management business segment
related to certain brokerage service reporting activities.

4.

The first quarter of 2015 included net discrete tax benefits of $564 million, primarily associated with the
repatriation of

non-U.S.

earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated due to an internal restructuring to simplify the Firm’s legal entity organization in the U.K. (see Note 20).

5.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Firm incurred specific severance costs of approximately $155 million, which
is included in Compensation and benefits expenses in the consolidated income statements, associated with the Firm’s restructuring actions, which were recorded in the business segments, approximately, as follows: Institutional Securities:
$125 million, Wealth Management: $20 million and Investment Management: $10 million.

6.

Summation of the quarters’ earnings per common share may not equal the annual amounts due to the averaging effect
of the number of shares and share equivalents throughout the year.

7.

Beginning with the dividend declared on July 20, 2016, the Firm increased the quarterly common stock dividend to
$0.20 per share from $0.15 per share.

2.

At December 31, 2016, the differences between period end balances and average balances were not significant.

3.

The weighted average interest rate was calculated using (a) interest expense incurred on all securities sold under
agreements to repurchase and securities loaned transactions, whether or not such transactions were reported in the consolidated balance sheets and (b) net average or period-end balances when applicable. In addition, off-balance sheet

securities-for-securities

transactions were not included in the average or period-end balances.

Cross-Border Outstandings

Cross-border
outstandings are based upon the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s (“FFIEC”) regulatory guidelines for reporting cross-border risk. Claims include cash, customer and other receivables, securities purchased under
agreements to resell, securities borrowed and cash trading instruments, but exclude commitments. Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed are presented based on the domicile of the counterparty, without reduction for
related securities collateral held. For information regarding the Firm’s country risk exposure, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management—Credit Risk—Country Risk Exposure” in Part
II, Item 7A.

The following tables set forth cross-border outstandings for each country, excluding derivative exposure, in which
cross-border outstandings exceed 1% of the Firm’s consolidated assets or 20% of the Firm’s total capital, whichever is less, at December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, in accordance with the

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we
conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule

13a-15(e).

Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Firm’s internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Firm;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Firm’s management and directors; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of
the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework (2013).

Based on management’s assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Firm maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.

The Firm’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited and issued a report on the Firm’s internal control over
financial reporting, which appears below.


December 2016 Form 10-K


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Morgan Stanley:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Morgan Stanley and subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of
December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Firm’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of
directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally

accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Firm maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2016, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
financial statements of the Firm as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 and our report dated February 27, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
