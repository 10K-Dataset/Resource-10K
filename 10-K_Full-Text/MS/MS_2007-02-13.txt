competitive position depends on innovation, execution capability and relative pricing. Morgan Stanley competes directly in the U.S. and globally with other securities and financial services firms and broker-dealers, and with others on a regional or
product basis. Morgan Stanley competes with commercial banks,



insurance companies, sponsors of mutual funds, hedge funds, energy companies and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and
through the internet.

Morgan Stanley’s ability to access capital at
competitive rates (which is generally dependent on Morgan Stanley’s credit ratings) and to commit capital efficiently, particularly in its capital-intensive underwriting and sales, trading, financing and market-making activities, also affects
its competitive position. Corporate clients continue to request that Morgan Stanley provide loans or lending commitments in connection with certain investment banking activities.

Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as financial institutions involved in a broad
range of financial services industries have been acquired by or merged into other firms. This convergence could result in Morgan Stanley’s competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services
and geographic diversity. It is possible that competition may become even more intense as Morgan Stanley continues to compete with financial institutions that may be larger, or better capitalized, or may have a stronger local presence and longer
operating history in certain areas. Many of these firms have greater capital than Morgan Stanley and have the ability to offer a wide range of products that may enhance their competitive position and could result in pricing pressure in our
businesses. The complementary trends in the financial services industry of consolidation and globalization present, among other things, technological, risk management, regulatory and other infrastructure challenges that require effective resource
allocation in order for Morgan Stanley to remain competitive.

Morgan Stanley
has experienced intense price competition in some of its businesses in recent years. In particular, the ability to execute trades electronically through the internet and other alternative trading systems has increased the pressure on trading
commissions. The trend toward the use of alternative trading systems will likely continue. It is possible that Morgan Stanley will experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of its competitors may seek to obtain
market share by reducing prices.

Asset Management.

Competition in the asset management industry is affected by several factors, including
Morgan Stanley’s reputation, investment objectives, quality of investment professionals, performance of investment products relative to peers and an appropriate benchmark index, advertising and sales promotion efforts, fee levels, the
effectiveness of and access to distribution channels, and the types and quality of products offered. Morgan Stanley’s products compete with the funds and separately managed account products of other asset management firms and other investment
alternatives.

Discover.

Credit cards issued by Discover compete directly with other bank-issued credit cards (the
vast majority of which bear the MasterCard or Visa servicemark), charge cards, credit cards issued by travel, entertainment and financial advisory companies and debit cards. Credit cards issued on the Discover Network by third parties may also
compete with credit cards offered by Discover. Competition centers on merchant acceptance of credit and debit cards (either directly or through merchant acquirers), account acquisition and customer utilization of credit and debit cards. Merchant
acceptance is based on, among other factors, competitive transaction pricing and the volume and usage of cards in circulation. Credit card account acquisition and customer utilization are driven by competitive and appealing credit card features,
such as fee levels, interest rates and other customized features targeting specific consumer groups. Credit card industry participants have increasingly used advertising, targeted marketing, account acquisitions and pricing competition in interest
rates, annual fees, reward programs and low-priced balance transfer programs to compete and grow.

The Discover Network competes with other card networks, including among others, MasterCard, Visa and American Express. The principal competitive factors that affect the network business include the number of merchants
that accept cards, the number of cards in force and the amount of spending on these cards, the quantity



and quality of places where cards can be used, the economic attractiveness to card issuers and merchants participating in the network, reputation and brand
recognition, innovation in systems, technology and product offerings, and quality of customer service.

Regulation.

Most aspects of Morgan Stanley’s
business are subject to stringent regulation by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and securities exchanges and by non-U.S. government agencies or regulatory bodies and securities exchanges. Aspects of Morgan Stanley’s public
disclosure, corporate governance principles, internal control environment and the roles of auditors and counsel are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations and rules of the SEC and the NYSE.

New laws or regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations (including changes in the
interpretation or enforcement thereof) either in the U.S. or elsewhere could materially adversely affect Morgan Stanley’s financial condition or results of operations. As a global financial institution, to the extent that different regulatory
regimes impose inconsistent or iterative requirements on the conduct of its business, Morgan Stanley faces complexity and additional costs in its compliance efforts.

Consolidated Supervision and Revised Capital Standards.

Effective December 1, 2005, Morgan Stanley became a consolidated supervised entity (“CSE”) as defined by the SEC. As such,
Morgan Stanley is subject to group-wide supervision and examination by the SEC and to minimum capital requirements on a consolidated basis. Morgan Stanley continues to work with its regulators on the implementation of the CSE rules and Basel II
capital standards. As rules related to Basel II are released, Morgan Stanley will consult with regulators on the new requirements. Compliance with EU requirements (capital, oversight and reporting) will be a focus item through 2008.

Anti-Money Laundering.

Morgan Stanley’s Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) program is coordinated and implemented on an enterprise-wide basis. In the
U.S., for example, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “PATRIOT Act”) imposes significant obligations to detect and deter money laundering and terrorist financing activity, including requiring banks, broker-dealers and mutual funds to
identify and verify customers that maintain accounts. The PATRIOT Act also mandates that certain types of financial institutions report suspicious activity to appropriate law enforcement or regulatory authorities. An institution subject to the
PATRIOT Act also must provide employees with AML training, designate an AML compliance officer and undergo an annual, independent audit to assess the effectiveness of its AML program. Outside the U.S., applicable laws and regulations subject
designated types of financial institutions to similar AML requirements. Morgan Stanley has established policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with these AML requirements.

Protection of Client Information.

Many aspects of Morgan Stanley’s business are subject to increasingly comprehensive
legal requirements concerning the use and protection of certain client information including those adopted pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 in the U.S., the European Union Data
Protection Directive in the EU and various laws in Asia, including the Japanese Personal Information (Protection) Law, the Hong Kong Personal Data (Protection) Ordinance and the Australian Privacy Act. Morgan Stanley has adopted measures in response
to such requirements.

Institutional Securities and Global Wealth Management
Group.

Broker-Dealer
Regulation.

MS&Co. and MSDWI are registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and are members of self-regulatory organizations,
including the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the “NASD”) and securities exchanges, including the NYSE. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales
and trading practices, securities offerings, publication of research reports, use



of customers’ funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping and retention and the conduct of their directors, officers, employees and other
associated persons. Broker-dealers are also regulated by securities administrators in those states where they do business. Violations of the laws and regulations governing a broker-dealer’s actions could result in censures, fines, the issuance
of cease-and-desist orders, revocation of licenses or registrations, the suspension or expulsion from the securities industry of such broker-dealer or its officers or employees, or other similar consequences by both federal and state securities
administrators.

Margin lending by broker-dealer subsidiaries is regulated by
the Federal Reserve Board’s restrictions on lending in connection with customer and proprietary purchases and short sales of securities, as well as securities borrowing and lending activities. Such subsidiaries are also required by NASD and
NYSE rules to impose maintenance requirements on the value of securities contained in margin accounts. In many cases, Morgan Stanley’s margin policies are more stringent than these rules.

Morgan Stanley conducts some of its government securities activities through Morgan Stanley
Market Products Inc., a NASD member registered as a government securities broker-dealer with the SEC and in certain states. The Department of Treasury has promulgated regulations concerning, among other things, capital adequacy, custody and use of
government securities and transfers and control of government securities subject to repurchase transactions. The rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which are enforced by the NASD, govern the municipal securities activities of Morgan
Stanley.

As registered U.S. broker-dealers, certain subsidiaries of Morgan
Stanley, including MS&Co. and MSDWI, are subject to the SEC’s net capital rule and the net capital requirements of various securities exchanges. Many non-U.S. securities exchanges and regulatory authorities either have imposed or are
proposing rules relating to capital requirements applicable to Morgan Stanley’s non-U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries. These rules, which specify minimum capital requirements, are generally designed to measure general financial integrity and
liquidity and require that at least a minimum amount of net assets be kept in relatively liquid form. See also “Consolidated Supervision and Revised Capital Standards” above and Note 13 in “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” in Part II, Item 8. Rules of the NASD, NYSE, Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade also impose limitations on the transfer of a broker-dealer’s assets.

Compliance with the capital requirements may limit Morgan Stanley’s operations requiring
the intensive use of capital. Such requirements restrict Morgan Stanley’s ability to withdraw capital from its broker-dealer subsidiaries, which in turn may limit its ability to pay dividends, repay debt or redeem or purchase shares of its own
outstanding stock. Any change in such rules or the imposition of new rules affecting the scope, coverage, calculation or amount of capital requirements, or a significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against capital, could adversely
affect Morgan Stanley’s ability to pay dividends or to expand or maintain present business levels. In addition, such rules may require Morgan Stanley to make substantial capital infusions into one or more of its broker-dealer subsidiaries in
order for such subsidiaries to comply with such rules, either in the form of cash or subordinated loans made in accordance with the requirements of the SEC’s net capital rule.

Regulation of Certain Commodities Activities.

In connection with the commodities activities in the
Institutional Securities business, Morgan Stanley engages in the production, storage, transportation, marketing and trading of several commodities, including metals (base and precious), crude oil, oil products, natural gas, electric power, emission
credits, coal and related products. Morgan Stanley also conducts certain power generation and energy trading activities through Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. and/or entities in which Morgan Stanley is the sole or majority shareholder. These
activities are subject to extensive and evolving energy, environmental and other governmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad. In the past several years, intensified scrutiny of the energy markets by U.S. federal, state and local
authorities in the U.S. and abroad and the public has resulted in increased regulatory and legal enforcement and remedial proceedings involving energy companies, including those engaged in power generation and liquid hydrocarbons trading. The EU has
increased its focus on the energy markets which has resulted in increased regulation of companies participating in the energy markets, including those engaged in power generation and liquid hydrocarbons trading.



Terminal facilities and other assets relating to Morgan Stanley’s commodities activities are also subject to
environmental laws both in the U.S. and abroad, including the U.S. Clean Air Act, which imposes obligations related to air emissions, and the U.S. Water Pollution Control Act, which regulates the discharge of wastewaters. In addition, pipeline,
transport and terminal operations are also subject to the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or the Superfund law, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and analogous state laws in connection with the
cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent wastes for disposal.

The workplaces associated with the transport, processing and storage facilities and pipelines Morgan Stanley or its subsidiaries own or
operate are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, other federal statutes and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of terminal and marine workers. In
addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires the maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information is provided to Morgan Stanley’s employees, state and local government
authorities and local residents. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances, could result in significant fines or
additional compliance costs.

Additional Regulation of U.S.
Entities.

As registered futures commission merchants, MS&Co. and MSDWI are subject to the net capital requirements of, and their activities are regulated by, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the
“CFTC”) and various commodity exchanges. Certain subsidiaries of Morgan Stanley are registered with the CFTC as commodity trading advisors and/or commodity pool operators. Morgan Stanley’s futures and options-on-futures businesses are
also regulated by the National Futures Association (the “NFA”), a registered futures association, of which MS&Co. and MSDWI and certain of their affiliates are members. Violations of the rules of the CFTC, the NFA or the commodity
exchanges could result in remedial actions including fines, registration restrictions or terminations, trading prohibitions or revocations of commodity exchange memberships.

Morgan Stanley Bank, through which Morgan Stanley conducts certain financing and lending activities, is an industrial bank chartered under
the laws of the State of Utah. It has deposits that are eligible for insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) in accordance with FDIC rules and is subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the
Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC. Morgan Stanley Bank is not considered a “bank” under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”). See also “Discover” below.

Morgan Stanley Trust National Association, a wholly-owned subsidiary, is a federally
chartered national bank whose activities are limited to fiduciary activities, primarily personal trust services. It is subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Morgan Stanley
Trust National Association is not FDIC-insured and is not considered a “bank” for purposes of the BHCA.

Non-U.S. Regulation.

Morgan Stanley’s businesses are also regulated extensively by non-U.S. regulators, including governments,
securities exchanges, commodity exchanges, self-regulatory organizations, central banks and regulatory bodies, especially in those jurisdictions in which Morgan Stanley maintains an office. As Morgan Stanley continues to expand its business
internationally, including in such countries as China, Dubai, Italy, Korea, Russia, Turkey and Qatar, it will become subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which it conducts business. Certain Morgan Stanley subsidiaries are regulated as
broker-dealers under the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Subsidiaries engaged in banking and trust activities outside the U.S. are regulated by various government agencies in the particular jurisdiction where they are chartered,
incorporated and/or conduct their business activity. For instance, the Financial Services Authority, the London Stock Exchange and Euronext.liffe regulate the Company’s activities in the U.K.; the Deutsche Borse AG and the Bundesanstalt
für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority) regulate its activities in the Federal Republic of Germany; the Swiss Federal Banking Commission regulates its activities in Switzerland; the Comisión
Nacional del Mercado del Valores (C.N.M.V.) regulates its activities in Spain; the Financial Services Agency, the Bank of Japan, the Japanese Securities Dealers Association and several Japanese securities and futures exchanges, including the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, the Osaka Securities Exchange and the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange, regulate its



activities in Japan; the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited and the Hong Kong Futures Exchange Limited
regulate its operations in Hong Kong; and the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited regulate its business in Singapore.

The EU’s European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Directive 2004/39/EC, the “Directive”) will affect several of
Morgan Stanley’s European subsidiaries by imposing detailed pan-European requirements in areas such as internal organization (including conflict management), best execution, real-time disclosure of completed transactions in shares, quoting
obligations for internalized client orders in shares, transaction reporting to regulators, client documentation and regulation of investment services related to commodity derivatives. The practical consequences of some of these changes on the
European markets are becoming clearer as the Directive is implemented into the national legislation.

Research.

Both U.S. and non-U.S. regulators continue to focus on research conflicts of interest. Research-related regulations have been implemented in many jurisdictions and are
proposed or under consideration in other jurisdictions. New and revised requirements resulting from these regulations and the global research settlement with U.S. Federal and state regulators (to which Morgan Stanley is a party) have necessitated
the development or enhancement of corresponding policies and procedures.

Asset Management.

The majority of subsidiaries related to
Morgan Stanley’s asset management activities and others, including MS&Co. and MSDWI, are registered as investment advisers with the SEC, and, in certain states, some employees or representatives of subsidiaries are registered as investment
adviser representatives. Many aspects of Morgan Stanley’s asset management activities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations primarily intended to benefit the investor or client. These laws and regulations generally grant
supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict Morgan Stanley from carrying on its asset management activities in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Sanctions that
may be imposed for such failure include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on Morgan Stanley engaging in various asset management activities for specified periods of time, the revocation of registrations, other censures and fines.

Morgan Stanley’s Asset Management business is also regulated outside the
U.S. For example, the Financial Services Authority regulates Morgan Stanley’s business in the U.K.; the Financial Services Agency regulates Morgan Stanley’s business in Japan; the Securities and Exchange Board of India regulates Morgan
Stanley’s business in India; and the Monetary Authority of Singapore regulates Morgan Stanley’s business in Singapore.

Morgan Stanley Trust, a wholly-owned subsidiary, is a federally chartered savings bank subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the Office of
Thrift Supervision (“OTS”). As a result of its ownership of Morgan Stanley Trust, Morgan Stanley is registered with the OTS as a unitary savings and loan holding company (“SLHC”) and subject to regulation and examination by the
OTS as a SLHC. Subsidiaries of Morgan Stanley, including Morgan Stanley Trust, are registered transfer agents subject to regulation and examination by the SEC.

Discover.

Morgan Stanley conducts substantial portions of its Discover business in the U.S. through its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Discover Bank, a Delaware chartered state bank. Discover Bank’s deposits are
eligible for insurance by the FDIC in accordance with FDIC rules and Discover Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the Office of the Delaware Bank Commissioner and by the FDIC.

Generally, a company that controls a “bank,” as defined in the BHCA, is required to
register as a bank holding company and is regulated as a bank holding company by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Discover Bank is considered a “bank” under the BHCA; however, under the BHCA, Morgan Stanley’s
control of Discover Bank is grandfathered and Morgan Stanley is generally not treated as a bank holding company for purposes of the BHCA as long as Discover Bank refrains from either engaging in commercial lending or taking demand deposits.



Federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations regulate extensively the relationships among cardholders and
credit card issuers. Under federal law, Discover Bank may charge interest at the rate allowed by Delaware law, the state in which it is located, and export such interest rate to all other states. Delaware law does not limit the amount of interest
that may be charged on loans of the type offered by Discover Bank. Federal and state bankruptcy laws, debtor relief laws and bank regulatory guidance may have a financial impact on Discover to the extent such laws or guidance result in any loans
being charged off as uncollectible.

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), the federal bank regulatory agencies are required to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements, and certain restrictions are
imposed upon banks that meet certain capital requirements but are not “well capitalized” for purposes of FDICIA. A bank that is not well capitalized, as defined for purposes of FDICIA, is, among other consequences, generally prohibited
from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited). Discover Bank and Morgan Stanley
Bank currently use brokered deposits as a funding source and, if they were not able to do so, their funding costs could be impacted.

Discover conducts its U.K. credit card business through Morgan Stanley Bank International Limited, Morgan Stanley’s chartered bank in the U.K., which is subject to
regulation related to capital adequacy, consumer protection and deposit protection. The bank is governed primarily by the U.K.’s Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and its activities are supervised by the Financial Services Authority and
by the Office of Fair Trading in relation to its consumer credit activities.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors.

Liquidity Risk.

Liquidity and funding risk refers to the risk
that Morgan Stanley will be unable to finance its operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or difficulty in liquidating its assets. Liquidity and funding risk also encompasses the ability of Morgan Stanley to meet its financial
obligations without experiencing significant business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten its viability as a going concern. For more information on how we monitor and manage liquidity and funding risk, see “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7 below.

Liquidity is essential to our businesses and we rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our operations.

Liquidity is essential to our businesses. Our liquidity could be substantially negatively
affected by an inability to raise funding in the long-term or short-term debt capital markets or an inability to access the secured lending markets. Factors that we cannot control, such as disruption of the financial markets or negative views about
the financial services industry generally, could impair our ability to raise funding. In addition, our ability to raise funding could be impaired if lenders develop a negative perception of our long-term or short-term financial prospects. Such
negative perceptions could be developed if we incur large trading losses, we are downgraded or put on negative watch by the rating agencies, we suffer a decline in the level of our business activity, regulatory authorities take significant action
against us, or we discover serious employee misconduct or illegal activity, among other reasons. If we are unable to raise funding using the methods described above, we would likely need to liquidate unencumbered assets, such as our investment and
trading portfolios, to meet maturing liabilities. We may be unable to sell some of our assets, or we may have to sell assets at a discount from market value, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Our borrowing costs and access to the debt capital markets depend significantly on our
credit ratings.

The cost and availability of unsecured financing
generally are dependent on our short-term and long-term credit ratings. Factors that are significant to the determination of our credit ratings or otherwise affect our ability to raise short-term and long-term financing include the level and
volatility of our earnings; our relative competitive position in the markets in which we operate; our geographic and product diversification; our ability to retain key personnel; our risk profile; our risk management policies; our cash liquidity;
our capital adequacy; our corporate lending credit risk; and legal and regulatory developments. A deterioration in any of these factors or combination of these factors may lead rating agencies to downgrade our credit ratings, thereby increasing our
cost of obtaining unsecured funding.

Our debt ratings also can have a
significant impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is critical, such as OTC derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. In connection with
certain OTC trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with the Institutional Securities business, we would be required to provide additional collateral to certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade by either Moody’s
Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s.

We are a holding
company and depend on payments from our subsidiaries.

We depend on
dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund all payments on our obligations, including debt obligations. Regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds
freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. In particular, many of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws and regulations that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to the parent
holding company, or that prohibit such transfers altogether in certain circumstances. These laws and regulations may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to make payments on our obligations.



If our liquidity and funding policies are not adequate, we may be unable to access sufficient
financing.

Our liquidity and funding policies have been designed to
ensure that we maintain sufficient liquid financial resources to continue to conduct our business for an extended period in a stressed liquidity environment. If our liquidity and funding policies are not adequate or we do not adhere to the policies,
we may be unable to access sufficient financing to service our financial obligations when they come due, which could have a material adverse franchise or business impact.

Market Risk.

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices of commodities or securities, rates, indices, implied volatilities (the price
volatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices), correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. For more information on how we monitor and manage market risk, see
“Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A below.

Our results of
operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by economic and other factors.

The amount, duration and range of our market risk exposures have been increasing over the past several years, and may continue to do so. Our results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations due
to economic factors. Results of operations in the past have been, and in the future may continue to be, materially affected by many factors of a global nature, including political, economic and market conditions; the availability and cost of
capital; the liquidity of global markets; the level and volatility of equity prices, commodity prices and interest rates; currency values and other market indices; technological changes and events; the availability and cost of credit; inflation; and
investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets. In addition, there have been legislative, legal and regulatory developments related to our businesses that potentially could increase costs, thereby affecting future results of operations.
These factors also may have an impact on our ability to achieve our strategic objectives.

The results of our Institutional Securities business, particularly results relating to our involvement in primary and secondary markets for all types of financial products, are subject to substantial fluctuations due
to a variety of factors, such as those enumerated above that we cannot control or predict with great certainty. These fluctuations impact results by causing variations in new business flows and in the fair value of securities and other financial
products. Fluctuations also occur due to the level of global market activity, which, among other things, affects the size, number and timing of investment banking client assignments and transactions and the realization of returns from our principal
investments.

During periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions, the
level of individual investor participation in the global markets may also decrease, which would negatively impact the results of our Global Wealth Management Group business. In addition, fluctuations in global market activity could impact the flow
of investment capital into or from assets under management or supervision and the way customers allocate capital among money market, equity, fixed income or other investment alternatives, which could negatively impact our Asset Management business.
Furthermore, changes in economic variables, such as the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings, the rate of unemployment and the level of consumer confidence and consumer debt, may substantially affect consumer loan levels and credit
quality, which, in turn, could impact the results of our Discover business.

Holding large and concentrated positions may expose us to losses.

Concentration of risk may reduce revenues or result in losses in our market-making, proprietary trading, investing, block trading, underwriting and lending businesses in the event of unfavorable market movements. We
have committed substantial amounts of capital to these businesses, which often require us to take large positions in the securities of, or make large loans to, a particular issuer or issuers in a particular industry, country or region. Moreover, the
trend in all major capital markets is towards larger and more frequent commitments of capital in many of these activities, and we expect this trend to continue.



The profitability of certain of our commodities marketing activities depends on the availability of supplies of
petroleum products. A significant decrease in available supplies for any reason could adversely affect the sales and results of operations of certain businesses within our commodities activities.

The success of our marketing and distribution in our commodities business depends on our
ability to generate positive margins on sales of refined petroleum products. In addition, our terminal, tug and barge business depends on an active market for refined petroleum products to create demand for terminal services. The availability of
supplies of refined petroleum products is essential to our pipeline, transport and terminal operations. A material disruption in the flow of refined petroleum product supplies could adversely affect our revenues from rack spot and contract sales, as
well as throughput and storage fees. Among such risks are “force majeure” conditions caused by natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control. These conditions also may adversely affect
the pipeline and marine operations as well as the shipping and terminaling operations in our commodities business.

We may incur significant losses in the real estate sector.

We finance and acquire principal positions in a number of real estate and real estate-related products for our own account, for investment vehicles managed by affiliates
in which we also may have a significant investment, for separate accounts managed by affiliates and for major participants in the commercial and residential real estate markets, and originate loans secured by commercial and residential properties.
We also securitize and trade in a wide range of commercial and residential real estate and real estate-related whole loans, mortgages and other real estate and commercial assets and products, including residential and commercial mortgage-backed
securities. These businesses could be adversely affected by a downturn in the real estate sector.

Credit Risk.

Credit risk refers to the
risk of loss arising from the default by a borrower, counterparty or other obligor when it is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations to us. We are exposed to three distinct types of credit risk in our businesses. For more information on how we
monitor and manage credit risk, see “Credit Risk” in Part II, Item 7A below.

We are exposed to the risk that third parties that are indebted to us will not perform their obligations.

We incur significant, “single-name” credit risk exposure through the Institutional Securities business. This risk may arise, for example, from entering into
swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties have long-term obligations to make payments to us and by extending credit to our clients through various credit arrangements. We incur “individual consumer” credit risk in the
Global Wealth Management Group business through margin loans to individual investors and loans to small businesses, both of which are generally collateralized. We incur “consumer portfolio” credit risk in the Discover business primarily
through cardholder receivables. Credit risk in a pool of cardholder receivables is generally highly diversified, without significant individual exposures, and, accordingly, is managed on a portfolio and not a single-name basis.

The amount, duration and range of our credit exposures have been increasing over the past
several years, and may continue to do so. In recent years, we have significantly expanded our use of swaps and other derivatives and we may continue to do so. Corporate clients are increasingly seeking loans or lending commitments from us in
connection with investment banking and other assignments. In addition, we have experienced, due to competitive factors, increased pressure to assume longer-term credit risk, to extend credit against less liquid collateral and to price derivatives
instruments more aggressively based on the credit risks that we take. As a clearing member firm, we finance our customer positions and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our customers. Although we regularly review our
credit exposures, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.

Defaults by another larger financial institution could adversely affect financial markets generally.

The commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships between the
institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened



default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to
as “systemic risk” and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which we interact on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect Morgan
Stanley.

Operational Risk.

Operational risk refers to the risk of financial or other loss, or potential damage to a
firm’s reputation, arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, resources and systems or from external events (e.g. external or internal fraud, legal and compliance risks, damage to physical assets, etc.). Morgan Stanley may
incur operational risk across its full scope of business activities, including revenue generating activities (e.g. sales and trading) and support functions (e.g. information technology and facilities management). As such, Morgan Stanley may incur
operational risk in each of its businesses, as well as within the control groups. For more information on how we monitor and manage operational risk, see “Operational Risk” in Part II, Item 7A below.

We are subject to operational risk and an operational event could adversely affect our
businesses.

Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to
process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. In general, the transactions we process are increasingly complex. We perform the functions required to operate our different businesses
either by ourselves or through agreements with third parties. We rely on the ability of our employees, our internal systems and systems at technology centers operated by third parties to process a high volume of transactions. We also face the risk
of operational failure or termination of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions. In the event of a breakdown or improper operation of our or third
party’s systems or improper action by third parties or employees, we could suffer financial loss, an impairment to our liquidity, a disruption of our businesses, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation.

Despite the business contingency plans we have in place, our ability to conduct business may
be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located. This may include a disruption involving physical site access, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, electrical,
communications or other services used by Morgan Stanley, its employees or third parties with whom we conduct business.

Legal Risk.

Legal risk refers to the risk of non-compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and standards. Legal risk also includes contractual and commercial risk such as the risk that a counterparty’s
performance obligations will be unenforceable. For more information on how we monitor and manage legal risk, see “Legal Risk” in Part II, Item 7A below.

The financial services industry faces substantial litigation and regulatory risks, and we may face damage to our reputation and legal
liability.

We have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in
various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation, arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims
for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the issuers that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress.

We are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings
(both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business, including, among other things, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties,
injunctions or other relief. The number of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry, including us. Like any large corporation, we are also subject to risk from
potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure



of confidential information. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations or cause us significant reputational harm, which could seriously harm our business. For more information regarding legal proceedings in which we are involved and in particular, the

Coleman
Litigation

, see “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 below.

We are subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses.

We are subject to extensive regulation globally and face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our
businesses. Among other things, we could be fined, prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities or subject to limitations or conditions on our business activities. Significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse
financial effects, cause significant reputational harm to us, or harm our business prospects. New laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our clients may also adversely affect our business. For
more information regarding the regulatory environment in which we operate, see “Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 above.

Our commodities activities subject us to extensive regulation, potential catastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose us to
significant costs and liabilities.

In connection with the commodities
activities in our Institutional Securities business, we engage in the production, storage, transportation, marketing and trading of several commodities, including metals (base and precious), crude oil, oil products, natural gas, electric power,
emission credits, coal and related products. In addition, we own three exempt wholesale generators in the U.S. and one electric generation facility in the Netherlands. As a result of these activities, we are subject to extensive and evolving energy,
environmental, safety and other governmental laws and regulations. Our commodities business also exposes us to the risk of unforeseen and catastrophic events, including leaks, spills and terrorist attacks.

Although we have attempted to mitigate our pollution and other environmental risks, including
those discussed below, by, among other measures, adopting appropriate policies and procedures for power plant operations, monitoring the quality of petroleum storage facilities and transport vessels and implementing emergency response programs,
these actions may not prove adequate to address every contingency. In addition, insurance covering some of these risks may not be available, and the proceeds, if any, from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to
particular incidents. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by these events.

We also expect the other laws and regulations affecting our energy business to increase in both scope and complexity. During the past several years, intensified scrutiny
of the energy markets by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and abroad and the public has resulted in increased regulatory and legal enforcement, litigation and remedial proceedings involving companies engaged in the activities in
which we are engaged. We may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations and our overall businesses and reputation may be adversely affected by the current legal environment.

Pipeline, Marine Transport and Terminal Operations.

The risk of
substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in pipeline, marine transport and terminal operations. As is the case with respect to our other commodities activities, both U.S. and international environmental laws are or may be
applicable, including U.S. and foreign oil spill anti-pollution statutes. Liability may be incurred without regard to fault under federal laws and regulations and analogous state laws for the remediation of contaminated areas.

Prior owners, tenants or users of properties now owned by us or our subsidiaries may have
disposed of or released hydrocarbons or solid wastes on or under such assets. Additionally, the acquired pipeline, transport and terminal operations are located near current or former refining and terminal operations. There is a risk that
contamination, if ever present, has migrated or could migrate from those properties. Increasingly strict environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies and claims for damages and other similar developments could result in substantial costs
and liabilities.



Certain operations in our commodities business are subject to the hazards inherent in the transportation and storage of
volatile and sometimes toxic petroleum products, including explosions, the release of toxic substances, fires and accidents on land and at sea that could result in personal injuries, loss of life and suspension of operations. These operations also
are subject to risks associated with natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain substantial insurance coverage, catastrophic events of this kind could exceed such
coverage.

Power Generation Facilities.

The power
generation facilities we own are subject to wide-ranging U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad relating to air quality, water quality and hazardous and solid waste management. They also are regulated
under U.S. health and safety regulations. These laws may require capital expenditures as well as remediation where the facility has failed to comply with environmental, health or safety rules or has released pollutants into the environment.
Additionally, the owners of such facilities may be subject to fines or penalties for failure to comply with environmental, health or safety rules.

Oil Trading Activities.

The U.S. and foreign water pollution laws and numerous specific oil spill anti-pollution statutes apply to our oil
trading activities to the extent we own petroleum in storage or during waterborne or overland transit or we arrange for transportation or storage. In the event of an oil spill, one or more entities we own could be held responsible for remediation as
well as property and natural resource damages. Other U.S. federal and state laws apply to the specifications of the gasoline and diesel fuel that we blend and import and provide for substantial penalties in the event of non-compliance. Oil pollution
laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions also apply to us in certain instances when we trade petroleum internationally and/or charter vessels. Like the U.S. statutes, these laws often provide for penalties and damage assessments should a spill event occur.

Conflicts of interest are increasing and a failure to appropriately deal
with conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.

Our
reputation is one of our most important assets. As we have expanded the scope of our businesses and our client base, we increasingly have to address potential conflicts of interest, including those relating to our proprietary activities. For
example, conflicts may arise between our position as a financial advisor in a merger transaction and a principal investment we hold in one of the parties to the transaction. In addition, hedge funds and private equity funds are an increasingly
important portion of our client base, and also compete with us in a number of our businesses. We have procedures and controls that are designed to address conflicts of interest. However, appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex
and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, the SEC and other federal and state regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of
interest. It is possible that potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions. It is possible that the regulatory scrutiny of, and litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest will make our clients less
willing to enter into transactions in which such a conflict may occur, and will adversely affect our businesses.

We are subject to tax contingencies that could adversely affect results.

We are subject to the income and indirect tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in
which we have significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of
these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes
over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit.



Competitive Environment.

We face strong competition from other financial services firms, which could lead to pricing pressures that could materially adversely affect our revenue and
profitability.

The financial services industry, and all of our
businesses, are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete with commercial banks, insurance companies, sponsors of mutual funds, hedge funds, energy companies and other companies offering financial services in the U.S.,
globally and through the internet. We compete on the basis of several factors, including transaction execution, capital or access to capital, products and services, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial
services industry have become considerably more concentrated, as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. This convergence could result in our competitors gaining
greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. We may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing
prices. For more information regarding the competitive environment in which we operate, see “Competition” in Part I, Item 1 above.

Our ability to retain and attract qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our
performance.

Our people are our most important resource and
competition for qualified employees is intense. In order to attract and retain qualified employees, we must compensate such employees at market levels. Typically, those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense as
compensation is highly variable and moves with performance. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain our competitive position, or if compensation costs required to attract and
retain employees become more expensive, our performance, including our competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.

International Risk.

We are subject to numerous political, economic, legal, operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could adversely impact our businesses in many ways.

We are subject to political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that are inherent
in operating in many countries, including risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities. In many countries,
the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market. Our inability to remain in
compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally. We are also subject to the enhanced risk that transactions we structure
might not be legally enforceable in all cases.

We have expanded, and continue
to look at opportunities to expand, in the emerging markets. In the last several years, various emerging market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies, capital and
currency exchange controls and low or negative growth rates in their economies. These conditions could adversely impact our businesses and increase volatility in financial markets generally.

The emergence of a pandemic or other widespread health emergency, or concerns over the
possibility of such an emergency, could create economic and financial disruptions in emerging markets and other areas throughout the world, and could lead to operational difficulties (including travel limitations) that could impair our ability to
manage our businesses around the world.



Acquisition Risk.

We may be unable to fully capture the expected value from future acquisitions, joint ventures and minority stakes.

We expect to grow in part through acquisitions, joint ventures and minority stakes. To the
extent we make acquisitions or enter into combinations or joint ventures, we face numerous risks and uncertainties combining or integrating the relevant businesses and systems, including the need to combine accounting and data processing systems and
management controls and to integrate relationships with clients and business partners. In the case of joint ventures and minority stakes, we are subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon, and subject to
liability, losses or reputational damage relating to, systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control. In addition, conflicts or disagreements between us and our joint venture partners may negatively impact the benefits to be achieved
by the joint venture. There is no assurance that our recent acquisitions or any business we acquire in the future will be successfully integrated and result in all of the positive benefits anticipated. If we are not able to integrate successfully
our past and future acquisitions, there is a risk that our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

Credit Card Risk.

Our Discover business subjects us to risks that impact the credit card industry.

The performance of our Discover business is subject to numerous risks that impact the credit card industry, including rising cost of funds pressuring spreads; slow
industry growth with rising payment rates; future loan loss rate uncertainty, especially given bankruptcy reform and changing minimum payment requirements; and a consolidating industry with competitive pressures and increasing marketing constraints.
Changes in economic variables, such as the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings, the rate of unemployment and the level of consumer confidence, consumer spending and consumer debt may substantially affect consumer loan levels and credit
quality. Our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by these factors.

Risk Management.

Our hedging
strategies and other risk management techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk.

We have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future.
Nonetheless, our hedging strategies and other risk management techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated. Some
of our methods of managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior. As a result, these methods may not predict future risk exposures, which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate. Management
of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. For more
information on how we monitor and manage market risk, see “Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A below.

Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments.

Morgan Stanley, like other well-known seasoned issuers, from time to time receives written comments from the staff of the SEC regarding its periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act. There are no
comments that remain unresolved that Morgan Stanley received not less than 180 days before the end of its fiscal year to which this report relates that Morgan Stanley believes are material.



Item 2.    Properties.

Morgan Stanley has offices, operations and processing centers and warehouse facilities located throughout the U.S., and certain subsidiaries maintain offices and other facilities in international locations. Morgan Stanley’s properties
that are not owned are leased on terms and for durations that are reflective of commercial standards in the communities where these properties are located. Morgan Stanley believes the facilities it owns or occupies are adequate for the purposes for
which they are currently used and are well maintained. Our principal offices consist of the following properties:

*

The indicated total aggregate square footage leased does not include space occupied by Morgan Stanley securities branch offices.

**

The landlord of this location is a joint venture in which Morgan Stanley has a majority interest. Morgan Stanley has the right to purchase the remainder of the interest in the joint
venture in fiscal 2007.

***

Morgan Stanley holds the freehold interest in the land and building.



Item 3.    Legal Proceedings.

In addition to the matters described below, in the normal course of business, Morgan Stanley has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in
connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of
damages. In some cases, the issuers that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress.

Morgan Stanley is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory
agencies regarding Morgan Stanley’s business, including, among other matters, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. The number of these
reviews, investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry, including Morgan Stanley.

Morgan Stanley contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such
matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, Morgan Stanley cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such
matters, how or if such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be. Subject to the foregoing, and except for the

Coleman Litigation

(see
also Note 9 in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Part II, Item 8), Morgan Stanley believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of all other pending matters will not have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of Morgan Stanley, although the outcome of such matters could be material to Morgan Stanley’s operating results for a particular future period, depending on, among other things,
the level of Morgan Stanley’s revenues or income for such period.

Coleman Litigation.

On May 8, 2003, Coleman (Parent)
Holdings Inc. (“CPH”) filed a complaint against Morgan Stanley in the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit for Palm Beach County, Florida. The complaint relates to the 1998 merger between The Coleman Company, Inc.
(“Coleman”) and Sunbeam, Inc. (“Sunbeam”). The complaint, as amended, alleges that CPH was induced to agree to the transaction with Sunbeam based on certain financial misrepresentations, and it asserts claims against Morgan
Stanley for aiding and abetting fraud, conspiracy and punitive damages. Shortly before trial, which commenced in April 2005, the trial court granted, in part, a motion for entry of a default judgment against Morgan Stanley and ordered that portions
of CPH’s complaint, including those setting forth CPH’s primary allegations against Morgan Stanley, be read to the jury and deemed established for all purposes in the action. In May 2005, the jury returned a verdict in favor of CPH and
awarded CPH $604 million in compensatory damages and $850 million in punitive damages. On June 23, 2005, the trial court issued a final judgment in favor of CPH in the amount of $1,578 million, which includes prejudgment interest and excludes
certain payments received by CPH in settlement of related claims against others.

On June 27, 2005, Morgan Stanley filed a notice of appeal with the District Court of Appeal for the Fourth District of Florida (the “Court of Appeal”) and posted a supersedeas bond, which automatically stayed execution of the
judgment pending appeal. Morgan Stanley filed its initial brief in support of its appeal on December 7, 2005 and, on June 28, 2006, the Court of Appeal heard oral argument. Morgan Stanley’s appeal seeks to reverse the judgment of the
trial court on several grounds and asks that the case be remanded for entry of a judgment in favor of Morgan Stanley or, in the alternative, for a new trial.

IPO Fee Litigation.

Starting in late 1998, purported class actions, later captioned

In re Public Offering Fee Antitrust Litigation

(the “purchaser actions”) and

In re Issuer Plaintiff Initial Public Offering Fee
Antitrust Litigation

(the “issuer



actions”), were initiated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “SDNY”) against Morgan Stanley and numerous
other underwriters. The consolidated proceedings, one on behalf of purchasers and the other on behalf of issuers of certain shares in initial public offerings (“IPOs”), allege that defendants conspired to fix the underwriters’ spread
at 7% in IPOs of U.S. companies in the $20 million to $80 million range in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The complaints seek treble damages and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs’ claims for damages in the purchaser actions have
been dismissed, but the claims for injunctive relief remain. Plaintiffs’ claims for damages and injunctive relief remain in the issuer actions. Plaintiffs moved for class certification in both actions, and defendants opposed that motion on
May 25, 2005. On October 25, 2005, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment, which defendants opposed. On April 18, 2006, the court denied plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in the issuer actions. On May 1, 2006,
plaintiffs filed a petition pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) for leave to appeal the denial of class certification, and on August 1, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the “Second Circuit”)
granted plaintiffs’ petition. The case is otherwise stayed pending the appeal on class certification.

IPO Allocation Matters.

In March 2001,
a purported class action, now captioned

In re Initial Public Offering Antitrust Litigation

, was initiated in the SDNY against Morgan Stanley and numerous other underwriters of various IPOs. The consolidated amended complaint alleges that
defendants required customers who wanted allocations of “hot” IPO securities to pay undisclosed and excessive underwriters’ compensation in the form of increased brokerage commissions and to buy shares of securities offered in the
IPOs after the IPOs were completed (“tie-in purchases”) at escalating price levels higher than the IPO price (a practice plaintiffs refer to as “laddering”). The complaint alleges violations of federal and/or state antitrust
laws, including Section 1 of the Sherman Act. On September 28, 2005, the Second Circuit reversed the district court’s dismissal of this matter. On January 12, 2006, the Second Circuit denied defendants’ petition for
rehearing

en banc

. On March 8, 2006, defendants filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court for writ of certiorari, which was granted on December 7, 2006.

Also beginning in March 2001, numerous purported class actions, now captioned

In re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation

,
were filed in the SDNY against certain issuers of IPO securities, certain individual officers of those issuers, Morgan Stanley and other underwriters of those IPOs, purportedly on behalf of purchasers of stock in the IPOs or the aftermarket. These
complaints make factual allegations similar to the complaint in the antitrust action described above, but claim violations of the federal securities laws, including Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities
Act”) and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege that continuous “buy” recommendations by the defendants’ research analysts improperly increased or sustained the prices at which the securities
traded after the IPOs. On February 19, 2003, the underwriter defendants’ joint motion to dismiss was denied, except as to certain specified offerings. On December 5, 2006, the Second Circuit reversed the SDNY’s grant of class
certification, and ruled that these cases could not be certified for class treatment. On January 5, 2007, plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing

en banc

.

On June 10, 2004, plaintiffs and issuer defendants entered into a definitive settlement agreement under which insurers of the issuers
would guarantee recovery of at least $1 billion by class members. As part of the settlement, the settling issuer defendants agreed to assign to class members certain claims they had against the underwriters. Starting in late 2004, purported
assignees of certain issuers filed suits in the SDNY against several underwriter defendants, including Morgan Stanley, on the ground that underwriters breached the underwriting agreement and related duties by allocating shares in each company’s
IPO to customers who allegedly paid the underwriters “excess compensation.” On October 11, 2005, the SDNY dismissed the complaint with leave to replead. Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, which was dismissed with prejudice
on February 24, 2006. Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on May 31, 2006.

On April 2, 2002, a purported class action complaint, captioned

Breakaway Solutions, Inc. v. Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, et al.

, was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Morgan Stanley and two other



underwriters. The complaint was brought on behalf of a class of issuers that issued IPO securities from January 1, 1998 to October 31, 2000
pursuant to underwriting agreements with defendants and whose securities increased in value by 15 percent or more within 30 days following the IPO. The complaint alleges that defendants allocated underpriced stock to certain of defendants’
favored clients and, directly or indirectly, shared in portions of the profits of such favored clients pursuant to side agreements or understandings, with the alleged effect of depriving issuers of millions of dollars in IPO proceeds. The complaint
alleges breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith, breach of fiduciary duty, indemnification or contribution and unjust enrichment and restitution. The court dismissed plaintiffs’ claims except for its breach of fiduciary duty claim.

On September 30, 2005, Breakaway Solutions, Inc. (“Breakaway”)
filed another complaint in an individual action against Morgan Stanley and two other underwriters in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The complaint alleges that defendants underpriced Breakaway’s IPO stock, allocated this underpriced
stock to favored clients pursuant to a profit sharing arrangement, and that Morgan Stanley improperly sold Breakaway shares before expiration of the lock-up period. The complaint alleges breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the covenant of good
faith against all the defendants and fraud and unjust enrichment against Morgan Stanley. This action has been stayed by agreement of the parties.

Global Wealth Management Group Employment Matters.

Wage and Hour Matters.

Complaints raising allegations of unpaid overtime and unlawful wage deductions against Morgan Stanley have
been filed in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Texas, Florida, Illinois and California seeking damages on behalf of certain current and former employees. In New Jersey, a purported class action, captioned

Steinberg v. Morgan Stanley &
Co., Inc. and Morgan Stanley DW Inc.

, was filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Bergen County (“New Jersey Superior Court”) on September 1, 2005 and was removed to the U.S. District Court for the District of New
Jersey (the “New Jersey District Court”) on October 7, 2005. A second purported class action, captioned

Robert Adler et al. v. Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc

.

and Morgan Stanley DW Inc

., was filed in New Jersey
Superior Court on May 22, 2006. On September 25, 2006, a third purported New Jersey class action, captioned

On May 22, 2006, a purported class action, captioned

Janemarie Lenihan v. Morgan
Stanley & Co., Inc. and Morgan Stanley DW Inc.

, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut. On June 23, 2006, a purported class action, captioned

Kyle R. Armitage v. Morgan Stanley & Co.,
Inc.

, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. On September 15, 2006, Morgan Stanley filed its answer and affirmative defenses to the

Armitage

complaint. On June 26, 2006, a purported class action,
captioned

Jennifer Taub v. Morgan Stanley DW Inc.

, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. On August 24, 2006, a purported class action, captioned

Joseph Stowell, Jr., v. Morgan Stanley DW Inc.

,
was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois. On September 8, 2006, plaintiffs in the

Armitage

and

Stowell

matters moved before the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation (the “Judicial
Panel”) to coordinate the various pending matters in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the “Northern District of Illinois”).

On October 18, 2006, a purported class action, captioned

Vernon Brown v. Morgan Stanley

was filed in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of California (the “Southern District of California”).

On October 9, 2006, Morgan Stanley reached an agreement to resolve the wage and hour claims filed by the

Steinberg

,

Adler

,

Gasman

,

Roles, Lenihan

and

Brown

plaintiffs

.

The agreement, which is
subject to, among other things, court approval, will resolve all claims brought by plaintiffs in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and



California as well as those of all other potential class members nationwide. On November 29, 2006, for purposes of executing the settlement, a
consolidated amended complaint, captioned

Steinberg, et al. v. Morgan Stanley

(“

Steinberg II

”), was filed in the Southern District of California.

On November 21, 2006, the

Taub

matter was dismissed with prejudice.

On November 30, 2006, a hearing was held in St. Louis, Missouri before the Judicial
Panel on the

Armitage

and

Stowell

plaintiffs’ motion for consolidation in the Northern District of Illinois. On December 27, 2006, the Panel issued an order centralizing the

Gasman

,

Roles

,

Steinberg

,

Lenihan

,

Armitage

and

Stowell

matters in the Southern District of California. The Judicial Panel also treated the

Quinn

,

Brown

and

Steinberg II

matters as potential “tag along” cases and issued a
conditional transfer order transferring those cases to the Southern District of California as well.

Gender Matters.

Morgan Stanley has also been named in two purported class actions alleging gender discrimination under state and federal law. On June 22, 2006, a
purported class action, captioned

Joanne Augst-Johnson et al. v. Morgan Stanley DW Inc.

, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. On June 22, 2006, a second purported class action, captioned

Daisy Jaffe v.
Morgan Stanley DW Inc.

, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Plaintiffs seek damages in law and in equity.

On October 12, 2006, a first amended complaint adding an additional named plaintiff, Denise Williams, was filed in the

Jaffe

matter. On October 30, 2006,
Morgan Stanley filed a motion to stay the class claims and a motion to dismiss certain of plaintiff Williams’ claims. On November 13, 2006, plaintiffs agreed to voluntarily dismiss without prejudice the claims which were the subject of
Morgan Stanley’s motion to dismiss. On January 19, 2007, the court granted Morgan Stanley’s motion to stay the class-wide allegations until March 15, 2007.

Late Trading and Market Timing

.

Starting in July 2003, Morgan Stanley received subpoenas and requests for information from various regulatory and governmental agencies,
including the SEC, the NYSE and various states, in connection with industry-wide investigations of broker-dealers and mutual fund complexes relating to possible late trading and market timing of mutual funds. Morgan Stanley continues to cooperate
with and provide information to regulators in connection with their inquiries.

AOL Time Warner Litigation.

Since 2003, Morgan Stanley has
been named as a defendant in a number of state court actions involving AOL Time Warner, including cases in California, Ohio and West Virginia. All of these cases also name as defendants AOL Time Warner, numerous individual defendants, AOL Time
Warner’s auditors and other investment banking defendants. The complaints allege that AOL Time Warner issued false and misleading financial statements by, among other things, inflating advertising revenues. These complaints name Morgan Stanley
in its capacity as financial advisor to Time Warner in the merger of America Online and Time Warner and/or as underwriter of bond offerings completed in 2001 and 2002. The complaints allege violations of Section 11 of the Securities Act and
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act (and Rule 14a-9 thereunder) in connection with the merger registration statement, as well as various state and common laws and violations of Section 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act in connection with
the bond registration statements.

In the coordinated California proceedings,
claims based on California common law fraud and Sections 25400 and 25500 of the California Corporations Code remain against Morgan Stanley. In the Ohio action, state securities law claims remain against Morgan Stanley. Motions to dismiss are pending
in the West Virginia action.

On January 30, 2006, numerous new individual
actions were filed against Morgan Stanley and other defendants by plaintiffs opting out of the class settlement of a previously filed federal class action. The claims against



Morgan Stanley in that class action had been dismissed by the SDNY. The new complaints contain similar factual allegations against Morgan Stanley and assert
similar claims, but also include a claim for violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act. These actions were transferred to the SDNY and consolidated. Plaintiffs have filed amended complaints in these actions. On June 30, 2006,
defendants filed motions to dismiss the claims common to all complaints.

Global Wealth Management Group NASD Email Matter.

On
December 19, 2006, the NASD commenced a disciplinary proceeding against MSDWI, alleging that it provided false information regarding the existence of emails and failed to provide such emails to arbitration claimants and
regulators in response to discovery obligations and regulatory inquiries, failed to preserve books and records and failed to establish and maintain systems and written procedures reasonably designed to preserve required records and to ensure that it
conducted adequate searches in response to regulatory inquiries and discovery requests for email, in violation of section 17(a) of the Exchange Act, Rule 17a-4 thereunder, NASD Conduct Rules 2110, 3010 (a) and (b) and 3110, NASD Procedural
Rule 8210 and Interpretative Material 10100 under NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure.

Shareholder Derivative Matters.

Beginning on July 19,
2005, shareholder plaintiffs filed purported derivative actions on behalf of Morgan Stanley against certain present and former directors and its former chief legal officer based on, among other things, agreements to pay the former CEO and
co-President of Morgan Stanley and the handling of a lawsuit resulting in an adverse judgment against Morgan Stanley. Four lawsuits filed in the SDNY have been consolidated, under the heading

In re Morgan Stanley Derivative Litigation

, and on
January 23, 2006, plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint that includes claims for, among other things, violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and breach of fiduciary duties and seeks, among other things,
rescission of the severance and compensation agreements and damages. On March 9, 2006, defendants moved to dismiss.

On July 19, 2005, a derivative lawsuit was filed in a New York state court challenging the agreement to pay the former co-President of Morgan Stanley and seeking an
accounting for losses as a result thereof. This matter has been stayed by agreement of the parties.

Indonesian Litigation.

In November
2003, two proceedings were initiated in the Indonesian District Courts by two members of the Asia Pulp & Paper Group (PT Indah Kiat Pulp & Paper Tbk and PT Lontar Papyrus Pulp & Paper Industry, respectively) against Morgan
Stanley and 13 other defendants with respect to two bond issues in 1994 and 1995 that were guaranteed by plaintiffs and in which Morgan Stanley acted as underwriter. The claims alleged that the bond issues were invalid and contrary to Indonesian
law, and alleged damages in the amount of all principal and interest paid under the bonds as well as other amounts. In November 2006 the Indonesian Supreme Court upheld the decisions at first instance and on appeal in favor of the plaintiff and
declared the bond issues to be illegal and void, holding that defendants (including Morgan Stanley) had committed unspecified tortious acts, but awarding no damages.

In April 2004, another proceeding was filed in the Indonesian District Courts by PT Lontar Papyrus against Morgan Stanley and 28 other
defendants, alleging that the defendants violated injunctions issued by the Indonesian District Court in the first claim brought by PT Lontar Papyrus and conspired to cause the failure of plaintiff’s restructuring negotiations. Plaintiff seeks
damages in respect of losses allegedly suffered. On September 28, 2005, the Indonesian District Court rejected the plaintiff’s claim against Morgan Stanley. On September 13, 2006, Morgan Stanley filed its counter-arguments to the
plaintiff’s memorandum of appeal that was filed with the Indonesian High Court on April 19, 2006.

In October 2004, an additional proceeding was filed in the Indonesian District Courts by APP International Finance Company BV, a member of the Asia Pulp & Paper Group and the issuer of the 1995 bond issue,
against



Morgan Stanley and 18 other defendants, making allegations similar to those in the November 2003 claim brought by PT Lontar Papyrus. Plaintiff seeks damages
in respect of losses allegedly suffered. On December 28, 2006, the Indonesian District Court issued its judgment, declaring the bond issue to be illegal and void, holding that defendants (including Morgan Stanley) had committed unspecified
tortious acts, but awarding no damages. Morgan Stanley has appealed this decision to the Indonesian High Court.

In January 2005, an additional proceeding was filed in the Indonesian District Courts by Indah Kiat International Finance Company BV, a member of the Asia Pulp &
Paper Group and the issuer of the 1994 bond issue, against Morgan Stanley and other defendants, making allegations similar to those in the November 2003 claim brought by PT Indah Kiat. Plaintiff seeks damages in respect of losses allegedly suffered.
In October 2006, the Indonesian High Court upheld on appeal the decision of the Indonesian District Court in favor of the plaintiff, declaring the bond issue to be null and void, holding that defendants (including Morgan Stanley) had committed
unspecified tortious acts, but awarding no damages. Morgan Stanley has appealed this decision to the Indonesian Supreme Court in Jakarta.

The following matter was terminated during the quarter ended November 30, 2006:

General American Litigation.

On April 24, 2006, a Second Amended Petition, captioned

Finke, et al. v. Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, et al.

, was filed in the Missouri Circuit
Court, Twenty-Second Judicial Circuit (St. Louis City), by the Director of the Department of Insurance for the State of Missouri and the Special Deputy Liquidator for General American Mutual Holding Company against MS&Co., Morgan Stanley and a
former officer of General American. The amended petition, which updated a petition first filed on or about July 28, 2004, asserts several causes of action against the Morgan Stanley defendants, including claims for fraud, breach of fiduciary
duty and negligent misrepresentation. The case arises out of the firm’s investment banking work in connection with a potential demutualization and initial public offering of General American in 1998-1999. Plaintiffs sought compensatory damages
of over $1 billion and punitive damages of over $3 billion. On November 8, 2006, the court granted final approval of a settlement agreement between the parties to resolve the matter.

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Morgan Stanley’s common stock trades on the NYSE under the symbol “MS.” At
January 31, 2007, Morgan Stanley had approximately 101,062 holders of record; however, Morgan Stanley believes the number of beneficial owners of common stock exceeds this number.

The table below sets forth, for each of the last eight fiscal quarters, the low and high sales prices per share of Morgan Stanley’s
common stock as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets and the amount of any cash dividends declared per share of Morgan Stanley’s common stock.



The table below sets forth the information with respect to purchases made by or on behalf of Morgan Stanley of its common
stock during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended November 30, 2006.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

(A)

Morgan Stanley’s Board of Directors authorized this program to purchase common stock to offset the dilutive impact of grants and exercises of awards under Morgan Stanley’s
equity-based compensation and benefit plans. At the time the program was publicly announced on January 7, 1999, it had no set expiration or termination date. There is no maximum amount of shares that may be purchased under the program.

(B)

Morgan Stanley’s Board of Directors authorized this program to purchase common stock for capital management purposes. The program was publicly announced on February 12,
1998 at which time up to $3 billion of stock was authorized to be purchased. The program was subsequently increased by $1 billion on December 18, 1998, $1 billion on December 20, 1999 and $1.5 billion on June 20, 2000. This program
has a remaining capacity of $600 million at November 30, 2006 and has no set expiration or termination date.

(C)

Share purchases under publicly announced programs are made pursuant to open-market purchases, Rule 10b5-1 plans or privately negotiated transactions (including with employee benefit
plans) as market conditions warrant and at prices Morgan Stanley deems appropriate.

(D)

Includes: (1) shares delivered or attested to in satisfaction of the exercise price and/or tax withholding obligations by holders of employee stock options (granted under
employee stock compensation plans) who exercised options; (2) restricted shares withheld (under the terms of grants under employee stock compensation plans) to offset tax withholding obligations that occur upon vesting and release of restricted
shares; and (3) shares withheld (under the terms of grants under employee stock compensation plans) to offset tax withholding obligations that occur upon the delivery of outstanding shares underlying restricted stock units. Morgan
Stanley’s employee stock compensation plans provide that the value of the shares delivered or attested, or withheld, shall be valued using the fair market value of Morgan Stanley common stock on the date the relevant transaction occurs, using a
valuation methodology established by Morgan Stanley.

On
December 19, 2006, Morgan Stanley announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $6 billion of Morgan Stanley’s outstanding stock under a new share repurchase program. The new program replaces the Company’s
Equity Anti-dilution Program and Capital Management Program with one repurchase program for capital management purposes that will consider, among other things, business segment capital needs, as well as equity-based compensation and benefit plan
requirements. Morgan Stanley expects to exercise the authorization over the next 12-18 months at prices Morgan Stanley deems appropriate, subject to its surplus capital position, market conditions and regulatory considerations.

Information relating to compensation plans under which Morgan Stanley equity securities are
authorized for issuance is set forth in Morgan Stanley’s definitive proxy statement for its annual shareholders meeting to be held on April 10, 2007 (to be filed within 120 days after November 30, 2006) (“Morgan Stanley’s Proxy
Statement”) under the captions “Item 3—Company proposal to approve the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan” and “Equity Compensation Plan Information” and is incorporated by reference herein.

Results of Operations.

Executive Summary.

Financial Information.





(1)

Amounts represent income from continuing operations before losses from unconsolidated investees, income taxes, dividends on preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption and
cumulative effect of accounting change, net.

(2)

Earnings applicable to common shareholders are used to calculate earnings per share (“EPS”) information. Fiscal 2006 includes a preferred stock dividend of $19 million.

(3)

Book value per common share equals common shareholders’ equity of $34,264 million at November 30, 2006, $29,182 million at November 30, 2005 and $28,206 million at

(4)

The computation of average common equity for each segment is based upon an economic capital model that the Company uses to determine the amount of equity capital needed to support
the risk of its business activities and to ensure that the Company remains adequately capitalized. Economic capital is defined as the amount of capital needed to run the business through the business cycle and satisfy the requirements of regulators,
rating agencies and the market. The Company’s methodology is based on an approach that assigns economic capital to each segment based on regulatory capital usage plus additional capital for stress losses, goodwill and intangible assets, and
principal investment risk. The economic capital model and allocation methodology may be enhanced over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment. The effective tax rates used in the computation of segment return on
average common equity were determined on a separate entity basis.

Fiscal 2006 Performance.

Company Results

.

The Company recorded net income of $7,472 million in fiscal 2006,
a 51% increase from $4,939 million in the prior year. Net revenues (total revenues less interest expense and the provision for loan losses) rose 26% to a record $33,858 million in fiscal 2006, and non-interest expenses increased 18% to $22,858
million. Diluted earnings per share were $7.07 compared with $4.57 a year ago. Compensation and benefits expense increased 27%, primarily reflecting higher net revenues. Non-compensation expenses increased 5% as costs associated with higher levels
of business activity were partially offset by lower charges for legal and regulatory matters. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $7.09 compared with $4.81 last year. The return on average common equity in fiscal 2006 was
23.5% compared with 17.3% in the prior year. The return on average common equity from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was 23.6% compared with 19.0% last year.

Results for fiscal 2006 included non-cash incremental compensation expenses of approximately $270 million for stock-based awards granted to
retirement-eligible employees (see “Other Items—Stock-Based Compensation” herein). Results for fiscal 2005 included a charge of $509 million ($316 million after-tax) for discontinued operations related to the sale of the aircraft
leasing business (see “Other Items—Discontinued Operations” herein). In addition, pre-tax results for fiscal 2005 included a $360 million charge related to the

Coleman Litigation

, legal accruals of approximately $120 million
related to the Parmalat matter, a $109 million charge for the correction in the method of accounting for certain real estate leases, charges for senior management severance and new hires of approximately $311 million, and a gain of $251 million
related to an insurance settlement (see “Other Items” herein).

The
Company’s effective income tax rate was 30.4% in fiscal 2006 compared with 26.5% in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006’s income tax provision included an income tax benefit of $280 million resulting from the resolution of a federal tax audit, while
fiscal 2005’s income tax provision included an income tax benefit of $309 million related to the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (see “Other Items” herein). Excluding the benefits from the federal tax audit and the
American Jobs Creation Act, the Company’s effective income tax rates in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 would have been 33.0% and 30.8%, respectively. The increase primarily reflected lower estimated domestic tax credits and higher earnings, which
reduced the effect of permanent differences, partially offset by the effects of lower tax rates applicable to non-U.S. earnings.

At fiscal year-end, the Company had 55,310 employees worldwide compared with 53,218 at the prior year-end.

Institutional Securities.

Institutional Securities recorded income from continuing operations before
losses from unconsolidated investees, income taxes and net cumulative effect of accounting change of $8,160 million, a 72% increase from a year ago. Net revenues rose 38% to $21,562 million driven by record results in fixed income and equity sales
and trading and fixed income underwriting, along with strong results in advisory revenues. Non-interest expenses increased 23% to $13,402 million, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense resulting from higher net revenues.
Non-compensation expenses were relatively unchanged as higher costs associated with higher levels of business activity were offset by lower charges for legal and regulatory matters.

Investment banking revenues rose 24% from last year to $4,318 million. Underwriting revenues rose 24% from last year to $2,475 million.
Advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions were $1,843 million, an increase of 25% from fiscal 2005.

Fixed income sales and trading revenues were a record $9,577 million, up 41% from a year ago. The increase was driven by record results from commodities, credit products,
and interest rate and currency products. Commodities revenues reflected strong results from electricity, natural gas products and oil liquids. Credit product revenues benefited from significantly improved corporate credit trading and strength in
residential and commercial securitized products. Commodities and interest rate and currency products benefited from revenues recognized on structured transactions as a result of increased observability of market value (see “Other
Items—Accounting Developments—Fair Value Measurements” herein). Equity sales and trading revenues were a record $6,320 million, up 32% from a year ago. The increase was broad based and included higher revenues from derivatives and
equity cash products, financing products, prime brokerage and principal trading strategies.



Principal transaction net investment revenues increased 125% to $1,477 million in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2006’s results
primarily related to net gains associated with the Company’s investments, including both realized and unrealized gains from investments in the Company’s real estate funds, IntercontinentalExchange, Grifols S.A., the NYSE Group, Inc. (the
“NYSE”) and Wacker Chemie AG.

Global Wealth Management
Group.

Global Wealth Management Group recorded income before taxes and net cumulative effect of accounting change of $509 million, down 13% from the prior year. Fiscal 2005 included a benefit of $198 million resulting
from the insurance settlement related to the events of September 11, 2001 (see “Other Items—Insurance Settlement” herein), partially offset by a $29 million charge for the correction in the method of accounting for certain real
estate leases (see “Other Items—Lease Adjustment” herein). Net revenues were $5,505 million, a 10% increase over a year ago, primarily reflecting higher net interest revenue from the bank deposit program and an increase in revenues
from fee-based products. Total non-interest expenses were $4,996 million, a 13% increase from a year ago. Excluding the insurance settlement and the lease adjustment, total non-interest expenses increased 9%, primarily reflecting higher compensation
and benefits expense resulting from higher net revenues, partially offset by lower non-compensation expenses due to lower charges for legal and regulatory costs. Total client assets increased to $686 billion, up 11% from the prior fiscal year-end.
In addition, client assets in fee-based accounts increased 19% from a year ago to a record $206 billion and increased as a percentage of total client assets to 30% from last year’s 28%. At fiscal year-end, the number of global representatives
was 8,030, a decline of 1,496 from a year ago, resulting largely from planned sales force reductions completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and attrition.

Asset Management

.

Asset Management recorded income before taxes and net cumulative
effect of accounting change of $711 million, a 29% decrease from last year. Net revenues of $2,770 million decreased 5% from the prior year, largely due to lower investment revenues, primarily in the private equity business. Principal transaction
net investment gains for the year were $139 million compared with $326 million a year ago. Non-interest expenses increased 8% from the prior year to $2,059 million, primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefits expense associated with
critical business initiatives to retain and attract new talent in the business and support areas. Assets under management or supervision within Asset Management of $478 billion were up $47 billion, or 11%, from last year, primarily due to market
appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of customer assets. In fiscal 2007, the Company expects that Asset Management’s profit margins will be affected by its continued investments in its core business, alternative products and private
equity.

Discover.

Discover recorded
record income before losses from unconsolidated investees, income taxes and net cumulative effect of accounting change of $1,587 million, an increase of 72% from last year. Net revenues of $4,290 million were 24% higher than a year ago, benefiting
from improvements in credit quality and a continued favorable impact on charge-offs following the enactment of federal bankruptcy legislation that became effective in October 2005. Servicing and securitization income of $2,338 million increased 45%
from a year ago due primarily to a lower Provision for consumer loan losses and higher Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net. The increase also reflected higher Other revenues, which was attributable to an increase in the fair value of the
Company’s retained interests in securitized receivables. Non-interest expenses of $2,703 million increased 7% from the prior year, primarily due to costs associated with the Goldfish acquisition (see “Other Items—Business and Other
Acquisitions and Dispositions” herein), higher compensation and benefits expense and higher legal costs. In fiscal 2006, Discover’s results benefited from the continued favorable credit environment. In fiscal 2007, the Company expects
Discover’s margins to return to more normal levels.

The managed credit
card net principal charge-off rate decreased 115 basis points from a year ago to 4.08%. The managed over 30-day delinquency rate decreased 47 basis points to 3.51% from a year ago, and the managed over 90-day delinquency rate was 10 basis points
lower than a year ago at 1.65%. Managed credit card loans were $50,291 million at year-end, a 7% increase from a year ago.

Global Market and Economic Conditions in Fiscal 2006.

Global market and economic conditions were generally favorable throughout most of fiscal 2006, which contributed to the increased revenues and net income achieved by the
Company during the fiscal year. Although



there were concerns about energy prices, inflation and geopolitical risks, activity in the global capital markets was robust, and the volume of merger and
acquisition and underwriting transactions increased from the prior year.

The
U.S. economy continued to demonstrate strength during fiscal 2006. The rate of economic growth was generally strong, although it moderated during the second half of the fiscal year as consumer spending was affected
by higher energy prices and a slowdown in the residential real estate market. The U.S. unemployment rate declined to 4.5% from 5.0% at the end of the prior fiscal year. Conditions in the U.S. equity markets were also
generally favorable during fiscal 2006. Major equity market indices increased despite experiencing a correction during the summer as the favorable economic environment and strong corporate earnings outweighed
concerns about inflation, energy prices and rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve Board (the “Fed”) raised both the overnight lending rate and the discount rate by an aggregate of 1.25% in fiscal 2006. The
Fed held interest rates steady after the end of June, however, as there were indications that inflationary pressures had subsided.

In Europe, economic growth continued at a moderate pace during fiscal 2006, primarily driven by domestic demand and exports. Major equity market indices in
Europe increased during the year, reflecting strong corporate profits, merger and acquisition activity, and favorable economic conditions. The European Central Bank (the “ECB”) raised the benchmark interest rate by an aggregate
of 1.25% during fiscal 2006. In December 2006, the ECB raised the benchmark interest rate by an additional 0.25%. Economic growth also continued in the U.K., supported by domestic demand and business investment. The
Bank of England (the “BOE”) raised the benchmark interest rate by an aggregate of 0.50% during fiscal 2006. In January 2007, the BOE raised the benchmark interest rate by an additional 0.25%.

In Japan, economic growth continued to be driven by domestic demand and
exports. The level of unemployment also remained relatively low, and Japanese equity market indices increased during the fiscal year. During fiscal 2006, the Bank of Japan raised the benchmark interest rate from 0.0% to
0.25%. Economies elsewhere in Asia also expanded, particularly in China, which benefited from strength in exports, domestic demand and continued globalization. Equity market indices in China increased sharply during the year. In
fiscal 2006, the People’s Bank of China raised the benchmark interest rate by an aggregate of 0.54%.

Business Segments.

The remainder of
“Results of Operations” is presented on a business segment basis before discontinued operations. Substantially all of the Company’s operating revenues and operating expenses can be directly attributed to its business segments. Certain
revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective revenues or other relevant measures.

As a result of treating certain intersegment transactions as transactions with external parties, the Company includes an Intersegment Eliminations category to reconcile
the business segment results to the Company’s consolidated results. Income before taxes in Intersegment Eliminations primarily represents the effect of timing differences associated with the revenue and expense recognition of commissions paid
by Asset Management to Global Wealth Management Group associated with sales of certain products and the related compensation costs paid to Global Wealth Management Group’s global representatives. Income before taxes recorded in Intersegment
Eliminations was $33 million, $94 million and $118 million in fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. In addition, the results in Institutional Securities for fiscal 2006 included a $30 million advisory fee related to the
Company’s sale of the aircraft leasing business that was eliminated in consolidation.



INSTITUTIONAL SECURITIES

INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION

Investment
Banking

.

Investment banking revenues are derived from the underwriting of securities offerings and fees from advisory services. Investment banking revenues were as follows:

Investment banking revenues increased
24% in fiscal 2006. The increase was due to higher revenues from merger, acquisition and restructuring activities and fixed income and equity underwriting transactions. In fiscal 2005, investment banking revenues increased 16%, primarily reflecting
higher revenues from merger, acquisition and restructuring activities and fixed income underwriting transactions, partially offset by lower revenues from equity underwritings.

In fiscal 2006, advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions increased 25% to $1,843 million. Advisory fees in
fiscal 2006 reflected certain internal revenues, including a $30 million fee related to the Company’s sale of the aircraft leasing business that was eliminated in consolidation. In fiscal 2005, advisory fees from merger, acquisition and
restructuring transactions increased 28% to $1,478 million. The results in both fiscal years reflected a strong volume of transaction activity as conditions in the worldwide merger and acquisition markets were generally favorable throughout both
fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005.



Equity underwriting revenues increased 17% to $1,059 million in fiscal 2006 and reflected higher global industry-wide
equity and equity-related activity, most notably relating to a strong volume of initial public offerings. Equity underwriting revenues decreased 9% to $905 million in fiscal 2005, reflective of lower global industry-wide equity and equity-related
activity.

Fixed income underwriting revenues rose 29% to a record $1,416
million in fiscal 2006 and increased 27% to $1,094 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to an increase in underwriting revenues from non-investment grade and investment grade products as the level of issuer
refinancings rose due to record levels of maturing debt. The increase in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to higher revenues from global high-yield and securitized fixed income transactions. Acquisition-related financing resulting from a strong market
for merger and acquisition activity contributed to the increases in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Both fiscal years also reflected generally favorable conditions in the global fixed income markets, and, although the Fed increased the overnight
interest rate in both fiscal years, longer-term interest rates remained at relatively low levels. The attractive debt financing environment contributed to higher revenues as issuers continued to take advantage of relatively low financing costs.

At the end of fiscal 2006, the backlog of merger, acquisition and
restructuring transactions and equity and fixed income underwriting transactions was higher as compared with the end of fiscal 2005. The backlog of merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions and equity and fixed income underwriting
transactions is subject to the risk that transactions may not be completed due to unforeseen economic and market conditions, adverse developments regarding one of the parties to the transaction, a failure to obtain required regulatory approval or a
decision on the part of the parties involved not to pursue a transaction.

Sales and Trading Revenues

.

Sales and trading revenues are composed of principal transaction trading revenues, commissions and net interest revenues (expenses). In assessing the profitability of
its sales and trading activities, the Company views principal trading, commissions and net interest revenues in the aggregate. In addition, decisions relating to principal transactions are based on an overall review of aggregate revenues and costs
associated with each transaction or series of transactions. This review includes, among other things, an assessment of the potential gain or loss associated with a transaction, including any associated commissions, dividends, the interest income or
expense associated with financing or hedging the Company’s positions and other related expenses.

The components of the Company’s sales and trading revenues are described below:

Principal Transactions–Trading.

Principal transaction trading revenues include revenues from customers’ purchases and sales of
financial instruments in which the Company acts as principal and gains and losses on the Company’s positions. The Company also engages in proprietary trading activities for its own account.

Commissions.

Commission revenues primarily arise from agency
transactions in listed and over-the-counter (“OTC”) equity securities and options.

Net Interest.

Interest and dividend revenues and interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including financial instruments owned and financial
instruments sold, not yet purchased, reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements, trading strategies, customer activity in the Company’s prime brokerage business, and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates.
Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions may be entered into with different customers using the same underlying securities, thereby generating a spread between the interest revenue on
the reverse repurchase agreements or securities borrowed transactions and the interest expense on the repurchase agreements or securities loaned transactions.

Total sales and trading revenues increased 36% in fiscal 2006 and 18% in fiscal 2005. The increase in both periods reflected higher fixed income and equity sales and
trading revenues.



Sales and trading revenues included the following:

(1)

Amounts exclude sales and trading revenues of $(793) million, $(499) million and $(227) million in fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively, which relate to
unallocated net revenues, net revenues associated with corporate lending activities and certain other adjustments.

(2)

Amounts include interest rate and currency products, credit products and commodities. Amounts exclude corporate lending activities.

Equity sales and trading revenues increased 32% to a record $6,320 million in fiscal 2006.
The increase was broad based and included higher revenues from derivatives and equity cash products, financing products, prime brokerage and principal trading strategies. Derivative revenues increased due to strong customer flows, although
volatility in the global equity markets continued to be generally low. Revenues from equity cash products reflected higher market volumes, particularly in Europe and Asia. Financing products revenues also benefited from increased client activity.
Prime brokerage generated record revenues for the third consecutive fiscal year, reflecting continued growth in global client asset balances. Global equity markets generally trended higher and created favorable opportunities for principal trading
strategies. Although commission revenues increased, revenues continued to be affected by intense competition, particularly in the U.S., and a continued shift toward electronic trading.

Equity sales and trading revenues increased 18% in fiscal 2005. The increase was broad based and included increased customer flows in
derivatives, higher revenues in prime brokerage, improved performance in principal trading strategies and higher revenues from equity cash products. Derivative revenues increased due to strong customer flows despite continued low levels of
volatility in the equity markets. Revenues in prime brokerage were driven by robust growth in client balances. Global equity markets generally trended higher and created favorable trading opportunities for principal trading strategies. Revenue from
equity cash products rose on higher market volumes, particularly in the European and Asian markets.

Fixed income sales and trading revenues increased 41% to a record $9,577 million in fiscal 2006. The increase was driven by record results from commodities, credit products, and interest rate and currency products.
Commodities revenues increased 112% due to strong results from electricity, natural gas products and oil liquids. Credit product revenues increased 46%, primarily due to significantly improved corporate credit trading and strength in residential and
commercial securitized products. Interest rate and currency products increased 4%. Both commodity and interest rate and currency products benefited from revenues recognized on structured transactions as a result of increased observability of market
value in accordance with EITF Issue No. 02-3, “Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities” (“EITF Issue No. 02-3”).
With the adoption of SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”) on December 1, 2006, the Company will no longer apply the revenue recognition criteria of EITF Issue No. 02-3 (see “Other Items—Accounting
Developments—Fair Value Measurements” herein).

Fixed income sales
and trading revenues increased 22% in fiscal 2005, primarily due to higher revenues from interest rate and currency and credit products, partially offset by lower revenues from commodities products. Interest rate and currency product revenues
increased 41% primarily due to higher revenues from interest rate cash and derivative products and higher revenues from emerging market fixed income securities, partially offset by lower revenues from foreign exchange products. Interest rate and
currency product revenues benefited from strong new client transaction activity and favorable positioning results. The 19% increase in credit product revenues was primarily due to increased customer flows in securitized products and favorable
trading conditions. Commodities revenues decreased 8% from the prior year as lower revenues in oil liquids were partially offset by record results in electricity and natural gas products.



In addition to the equity and fixed income sales and trading revenues discussed above, sales and trading revenues include
the net revenues from the Company’s corporate lending activities. In fiscal 2006, revenues from corporate lending activities decreased by approximately $50 million from the prior year. In fiscal 2005, revenues from corporate lending activities
decreased by approximately $240 million. In both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, revenues from corporate lending activities reflected the impact of mark-to-market valuations on a higher level of new loans made in both fiscal years.

Principal Transactions-Investments.

The Company’s
investments generally are held for appreciation and to facilitate other business activities. It is not possible to determine when the Company will realize the value of such investments since, among other factors, such investments generally are
subject to significant sales restrictions. Moreover, estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or
in relation to specific transactions.

Principal transaction net investment
revenues aggregating $1,477 million were recognized in fiscal 2006 as compared with $656 million in fiscal 2005 and $364 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in fiscal 2006 was primarily related to net gains associated with the Company’s
investments, including both realized and unrealized gains from investments in the Company’s real estate funds, IntercontinentalExchange, Grifols S.A., the NYSE and Wacker Chemie AG. Fiscal 2005’s results included gains from investments in
IntercontinentalExchange, International Securities Exchange and Digital Globe Inc.

Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees.

Asset management, distribution and administration fees include revenues from asset management services, primarily fees associated with the
Company’s real estate fund investment activities.

Asset management,
distribution and administration fees increased 70% in fiscal 2006 and 6% in fiscal 2005. The increase in fiscal 2006 was primarily related to higher fees associated with real estate fund investments.

Other.

Other revenues consist primarily of revenues from
providing benchmark indices and risk management analytics associated with Morgan Stanley Capital International Inc., which includes the results of Barra, Inc. (“Barra”). Other revenues also include revenues related to the operation of
pipelines, terminals and barges and the distribution of refined petroleum products associated with TransMontaigne Inc. (“TransMontaigne”) and the marine transportation and logistics services associated with the Heidmar Group (see
“Other Items—Business and Other Acquisitions and Dispositions” herein).

Other revenues increased 34% in fiscal 2006 and 58% in fiscal 2005. The increase in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to higher sales of benchmark indices and risk management analytic products. The increase in
fiscal 2006 was also partly attributable to revenues associated with TransMontaigne, which was acquired on September 1, 2006.

Non-Interest Expenses.

Non-interest expenses increased 23% in fiscal 2006. Compensation and benefits expense increased 36%, primarily
reflecting higher incentive-based compensation costs resulting from higher net revenues. Fiscal 2006 also included Institutional Securities’ share ($190 million) of incremental compensation expense related to equity awards to
retirement-eligible employees (see “Other Items—Stock-Based Compensation” herein), while fiscal 2005 included Institutional Securities’ share ($193 million) of the costs associated with senior management changes (see “Other
Items—Senior Management Compensation Charges” herein). Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non-interest expenses remained relatively unchanged. Occupancy and equipment expense decreased 6%, primarily due to a $71 million charge
that was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 for the correction in the method of accounting for certain real estate leases (see “Other Items—Lease Adjustment” herein). Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees increased 32%,
primarily reflecting increased equity and fixed income trading activity. Professional services expense increased 18%, primarily due to higher legal and consulting costs, reflecting increased levels of business activity. Other expenses decreased 49%



due to lower charges for legal and regulatory matters. Fiscal 2006 reflected a net reduction in legal accruals of approximately $40 million related to the

IPO

Allocation Matters

, the LVMH litigation and the settlement of the

General American Litigation

. Other expenses in fiscal 2005 included legal accruals of $360 million related to the

Coleman Litigation

and approximately
$170 million related to the Parmalat settlement and the

IPO Allocation Matters

.

Fiscal 2005’s total non-interest expenses increased 24%. Compensation and benefits expense increased 21%, reflecting higher incentive-based compensation costs due to higher net revenues and Institutional Securities’ share ($193
million) of the costs associated with senior management changes. Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non-interest expenses increased 29%. Occupancy and equipment expense increased 41%, reflecting higher rental costs, primarily in North
America. The increase also included a $71 million charge for the correction in the method of accounting for certain real estate leases. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees increased 14%, primarily reflecting increased trading activity. Information
processing and communications expense increased 11%, primarily due to higher telecommunications, market data and data processing costs. Professional services expense increased 31%, primarily due to higher consulting and legal costs, including costs
of $55 million related to the matters below. Other expenses increased 71%, reflecting legal accruals of $360 million related to the

Coleman Litigation

, approximately $170 million related to the Parmalat settlement and the

IPO Allocation
Matters

, while fiscal 2004 included legal accruals of $110 million related to the Parmalat settlement and the

IPO Allocation Matters

.



GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT GROUP

INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION

The revenues and expenses discussed
below include the results of Quilter Holdings Ltd. (“Quilter”), the Global Wealth Management Group’s standalone U.K. mass affluent business. On December 13, 2006, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement to sell
Quilter (see “Other Items—Business and Other Acquisitions and Dispositions” herein). The impact of Quilter to the Global Wealth Management Group’s operating results for all periods presented was not material.

Investment Banking.

Global Wealth Management Group
investment banking includes revenues from the distribution of equity and fixed income securities, including initial public offerings, secondary offerings, closed-end funds and unit trusts. Revenues also include fees earned from offerings
underwritten by the Institutional Securities business. Investment banking revenues increased 34% and 10% in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. The increase in both periods was primarily due to higher revenues from equity-related offerings
and unit trust products. The increase in fiscal 2005 was partially offset by lower revenues from fixed income underwritings.

Principal Transactions–Trading.

Principal transactions include revenues from customers’ purchases and sales of financial
instruments in which the Company acts as principal and gains and losses on the Company’s inventory positions held, primarily to facilitate customer transactions. Principal transaction trading revenues increased 2% in fiscal 2006, primarily
reflecting higher revenue from foreign exchange products, equity linked notes and municipal fixed income securities, partially offset by lower revenues from corporate and government fixed income products and other securities. In fiscal 2005,
principal transaction trading revenues decreased 10%, primarily due to lower customer transaction activity in corporate, government and municipal fixed income securities.

Principal Transactions–Investments.

Principal transaction net investment revenues were $53 million
in fiscal 2006 compared with a net loss of $(1) million in fiscal 2005 and a net loss of $(5) million in fiscal 2004. The results in fiscal 2006 were primarily related to realized and unrealized gains on the Company’s investments in Bolsas y
Mercados Españoles (BME) and the NYSE.



Commissions.

Commission revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed
and OTC equity securities and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options. Commission revenues decreased 2% and 7% in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. The decrease in both fiscal years largely reflected lower revenues
from equity products, which was related to lower agency activity with customers due, in part, to growth in other product areas, including investment banking and asset management.

Net Interest.

Interest and dividend revenues and
interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including customer bank deposits and margin loans and securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions. Net interest revenues increased 52% and 28% in fiscal
2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to increased customer account balances in the bank deposit program that was launched in November 2005. Balances in the bank deposit program rose to $13,301 million at
November 30, 2006 from $1,689 million at November 30, 2005. The increase in net interest income in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to growth in customer margin balances.

Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees.

Asset management, distribution and
administration fees include revenues from individual investors electing a fee-based pricing arrangement and fees for investment management, account services and administration. The Company also receives fees for services it provides in distributing
certain open-ended mutual funds and other products. Mutual fund distribution fees are based on either the average daily fund net asset balances or average daily aggregate net fund sales and are affected by changes in the overall level and mix of
assets under management or supervision.

Asset management, distribution and
administration fees increased 7% in fiscal 2006 and 20% in fiscal 2005. In both fiscal years, the increase was driven by higher client asset balances in fee-based accounts.

Client assets in fee-based accounts rose 19% to $206 billion at November 30, 2006 and increased as a percentage of total client assets
to 30% of total client assets from 28% in the prior year. Client assets in fee-based accounts rose 10% to $173 billion at November 30, 2005 and increased as a percentage of total client assets to 28% of total client assets from 26% in the prior
year. Client asset balances increased to $686 billion at November 30, 2006 from $617 billion at November 30, 2005, primarily due to market appreciation. Client asset balances in accounts greater than $1 million increased to $450
billion at November 30, 2006 from $375 billion at November 30, 2005.

Other.

Other revenues primarily include customer account service fees and other miscellaneous revenues. Other revenues decreased 7% in fiscal 2006 and increased 26% in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2006, the
decrease primarily reflected lower service fees. In fiscal 2005, the increase was primarily due to higher service fees and other miscellaneous revenues.

Non-Interest Expenses.

Non-interest expenses increased 13% in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 included a reduction in non-interest expenses
related to Global Wealth Management Group’s share ($198 million) of the insurance settlement related to the events of September 11, 2001 (see “Other Items—Insurance Settlement” herein). Compensation and benefits expense
increased 15%, primarily reflecting higher incentive-based compensation costs. In addition, fiscal 2006 expenses included Global Wealth Management Group’s share ($50 million) of the incremental compensation expense related to equity awards to
retirement-eligible employees, including new hires (see “Other Items—Stock-Based Compensation” herein), while fiscal 2005 included Global Wealth Management Group’s share ($48 million) of the costs associated with senior
management changes (see “Other Items—Senior Management Compensation Charges” herein). Excluding compensation and benefits expense and the insurance settlement, non-interest expenses decreased 4%. Occupancy and equipment expense
decreased 5%, primarily due to a $29 million charge for the correction in the method of accounting for certain real estate leases that was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 (see “Other Items—Lease Adjustment” herein).
Professional services expense increased 17%, largely due to higher sub-advisory fees associated with growth in fee-based assets and higher costs for outside legal counsel. Other expenses decreased 21%, primarily resulting from lower costs



associated with legal and regulatory matters. During fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, the Company recorded legal and regulatory expenses of approximately
$105 million and $170 million, respectively, related to ongoing regulatory, employment and branch litigation matters.

Non-interest expenses increased 4% in fiscal 2005 and included Global Wealth Management Group’s share ($198 million) of the insurance settlement related to the
events of September 11, 2001. Excluding the insurance settlement, non-interest expenses increased 9% in fiscal 2005. Compensation and benefits expense increased 5%, reflecting higher incentive-based compensation costs and Global Wealth
Management Group’s share ($48 million) of the costs associated with senior management changes. In addition, fiscal 2004 included a reduction in compensation expense of $27 million associated with the change in the method of accounting for
certain asset management and account fees (see “Other Items—Asset Management and Account Fees” herein). Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non-interest expenses increased 3%. Occupancy and equipment expense increased 11%,
primarily due to a $29 million charge recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 for the correction in the method of accounting for certain real estate leases. Information processing and communications expense increased 9%, primarily due to higher
telecommunications costs within the branch network. Professional services expense increased 31%, largely due to higher sub-advisory fees associated with growth in fee-based assets and revenues, as well as higher outside legal counsel and consulting
costs. Other expenses increased 16%, primarily due to costs associated with branch closings and higher legal and regulatory costs. In fiscal 2005, the Company recorded legal and regulatory expenses of approximately $170 million, primarily
related to employment matters and certain regulatory and branch litigation matters.



ASSET MANAGEMENT

INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION

Investment
Banking.

Asset Management generates investment banking revenues primarily from the underwriting of unit trust products. Investment banking revenues decreased 4% in fiscal 2006 and increased 16% in fiscal 2005. The
decrease in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected a lower volume of fixed income unit trust sales, partially offset by higher equity unit trust sales, which generate lower revenues in comparison with fixed income unit trust sales. The increase
in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a higher volume of unit trust sales. Unit trust sales volume increased 20% to $7.3 billion in fiscal 2006 and increased 11% to $6.1 billion in fiscal 2005.

Principal Transactions-Investments.

Asset Management
principal transaction investment revenues consist primarily of gains and losses on investments associated with the Company’s private equity activities and capital investments in certain of the Company’s investment funds, primarily in
alternative products.

Principal transaction net investment gains aggregating
$139 million were recognized in fiscal 2006 as compared with $326 million in fiscal 2005. The results in both fiscal years primarily reflected net investment gains on certain investments in the Company’s private equity portfolio, including
Aventine Renewable Energy Holdings, LLC. Fiscal 2005’s results also included a net investment gain on Triana Energy Holdings, LLC.

Private equity investments generally are held for appreciation. It is not possible to determine when the Company will realize the value of such investments since, among
other factors, such investments generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Moreover, estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market,
economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions.

Commissions.

Asset Management primarily generates commission revenues from dealer and distribution concessions on sales of certain funds. Commission revenues decreased 14% in fiscal 2006 and increased 7%
in fiscal 2005. The decrease in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to a decrease in commissionable sales of certain fund products, while fiscal 2005 reflected an increase in such commissionable sales.



Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees.

Asset management,
distribution and administration fees primarily include revenues from the management and supervision of assets, including fees for distributing certain open-ended mutual funds, shareholder servicing fees and management fees associated with the
Company’s private equity activities. These fees arise from investment management services the Company provides to investment vehicles pursuant to various contractual arrangements. The Company receives fees primarily based upon mutual fund daily
average net assets or quarterly assets for other vehicles.

Asset
Management’s period-end and average customer assets under management or supervision were as follows:

(1)

Certain prior-year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.

(2)

Americas Intermediary channel primarily represents client flows through defined contribution, insurance and bank trust platforms.

(3)

Amount represents Asset Management’s proportional share of assets managed by entities in which it owns a minority interest.



Activity in Asset Management’s customer assets under management or supervision during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005
were as follows:

(1)

Americas Intermediary channel primarily represents client flows through defined contribution, insurance and bank trust platforms.

(2)

Amount represents Asset Management’s proportional share of assets managed by entities in which it owns a minority interest.

Net outflows (excluding money markets) in fiscal 2006 were primarily associated with the
Company’s U.S. Institutional products and Americas Retail Morgan Stanley branded products, partially offset by positive flows into Americas Intermediary products. For fiscal 2006, positive flows into institutional liquidity assets were offset
by outflows from certain money market funds that were impacted by the growth of the Global Wealth Management Group’s bank deposit program.

Asset management, distribution and administration fees increased 2% in fiscal 2006 and 3% in fiscal 2005. The increase in both periods was due to higher management and
administration fees, partially offset by lower distribution fees. The higher management and administration fees in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 were associated with increases in average assets under management of 5% and 9%, respectively.

Non-Interest Expenses.

Non-interest expenses
increased 8% in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 included a reduction in non-interest expenses from Asset Management’s share ($43 million) of the insurance settlement related to the events of September 11, 2001 (see “Other
Items—Insurance Settlement” herein). Compensation and benefits expense increased 22% in fiscal 2006, primarily reflecting higher incentive-based compensation costs as well as the impact of new hires. In addition, fiscal 2006 included Asset
Management’s share ($20 million) of the incremental compensation expense related to equity awards to retirement-eligible employees (see “Other Items—Stock-Based Compensation” herein), while fiscal 2005 included Asset
Management’s share ($41 million) of the costs associated with senior management changes (see “Other Items—Senior Management Compensation Charges” herein). Excluding compensation and benefits expense and the insurance settlement,
non-interest expenses decreased 4%. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees decreased 14%, primarily reflecting lower amortization expense associated with certain open-ended funds. The decrease in amortization expense reflected a lower level of
deferred costs in recent periods due to a decrease in sales of certain open-ended funds. Marketing and business development expense increased 11%, primarily due to higher advertising and marketing costs.



Fiscal 2005’s total non-interest expenses decreased 1%, including Asset Management’s share ($43 million) of the
insurance settlement related to the events of September 11, 2001. Excluding the insurance settlement, non-interest expenses increased 2%. Compensation and benefits expense increased 9%, primarily reflecting higher incentive-based compensation
costs due to higher net revenues and Asset Management’s share ($41 million) of the costs associated with senior management changes. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees decreased 7%, primarily reflecting lower amortization expense associated
with certain open-ended funds. The decrease in amortization expense reflected a lower level of deferred costs in recent periods due to a decrease in sales of certain open-ended funds. Marketing and business development expense increased 19%,
primarily due to higher promotional costs associated with the Company’s Van Kampen products. Professional services expense increased 6% due to higher sub-advisory fees, partially offset by lower legal and consulting fees. Other expenses
decreased 20%, primarily due to a reduction in legal reserves resulting from the resolution of certain legal matters, partially offset by higher insurance expense.



DISCOVER

INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION

On December 19, 2006, the Company
announced that its Board of Directors had approved the spin-off of Discover (see “Other Items—Discover Spin-off” herein).

Merchant, Cardmember and Other Fees, Net.

Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net, include revenues from fees charged to merchants
on credit card sales (net of interchange fees paid to banks that issue cards on the Company’s merchant and cash access network), transaction processing fees on debit card transactions as well as charges to cardmembers for late payment fees,
overlimit fees, balance transfer fees, credit protection fees and cash advance fees, net of cardmember rewards. Cardmember rewards include various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus

®

reward program, pursuant to which the Company pays certain cardmembers a percentage of
their purchase amounts based upon a cardmember’s level and type of purchases.

In fiscal 2006, Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net, decreased 12%, primarily due to higher cardmember rewards and lower merchant discount revenues, partially offset by higher cardmember and other fees. The increase in cardmember
rewards reflected record sales volume and the impact of promotional programs. The decrease in merchant discount revenues was due to higher allocations of interchange revenue to securitization transactions, partially offset by record sales volume.
For securitization transactions completed on or after November 3, 2004, the Company allocated interchange revenue to new securitization transactions, which has the effect of decreasing Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net, and increasing
Servicing and securitization income. During fiscal 2006, the Company had a higher level of outstanding securitization transactions receiving interchange revenue allocations than in the prior year. The increase in sales volume reflected increased
cardmember usage and the acquisition of Goldfish in February 2006 (see “Other Items—Business and Other Acquisitions and Dispositions” herein). The increase in cardmember and other fees was primarily related to higher balance transfer
fees, lower fee net charge-offs and higher credit protection fees.

In fiscal
2005, Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net, were relatively unchanged as higher transaction processing revenues were offset by higher net cardmember rewards. The increase in transaction processing



revenues was related to the acquisition of PULSE on January 12, 2005 (see “Other Items—Business and Other Acquisitions and Dispositions”
herein). The increase in net cardmember rewards reflected record sales volume and the impact of promotional programs.

Servicing and Securitization Income.

Servicing and securitization income is revenue derived from consumer loans that have been sold
to investors through asset securitizations. Cash flows from the interest yield and cardmember fees generated by securitized general purpose credit card loans as well as interchange fees for certain securitization transactions are used to pay
investors in these loans a predetermined fixed or floating rate of return on their investment, to reimburse investors for losses of principal resulting from charged-off loans and to pay the Company a fee for servicing the loans (“servicing
rights”). Any excess cash flows remaining (“excess servicing rights”) are paid to the Company. The sale of general purpose credit card loans through asset securitizations, therefore, has the effect of converting portions of net credit
income and fee income to servicing and securitization income.

Included in
Servicing and securitization income are revenues from servicing rights, excess servicing rights and gains or losses on general purpose credit card asset securitizations as well as the change in the fair value of the Company’s retained interests
in general purpose credit card asset securitizations.

The table below presents
the components of Servicing and securitization income:

Servicing and securitization income is
affected by the level of securitized loans, the spread between the net interest yield on the securitized loans and the yield paid to the investors, the rate of credit losses on securitized loans and the level of merchant, cardmember and other fees
earned. The Other revenue component of Servicing and securitization income includes net securitization gains and losses on general purpose credit card loans and the change in the fair value of the Company’s retained interests in general purpose
credit card asset securitizations.

Servicing and securitization income
increased 45% in fiscal 2006, primarily due to a lower Provision for consumer loan losses, higher Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net, and higher Other revenue, partially offset by lower net interest revenues. The lower Provision for consumer
loan losses was primarily attributable to a lower level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans and a lower rate of net principal charge-offs on the securitized general purpose credit card loan portfolio. The increase in Merchant,
cardmember and other fees, net, primarily reflected a higher level of outstanding securitization transactions that received interchange revenues. The increase in Other revenue was attributable to an increase in the fair value of the Company’s
retained interests in securitized receivables, primarily resulting from a continued favorable impact on charge-offs following the enactment of federal bankruptcy legislation effective in October 2005. The increase in Other revenue also reflected
higher levels of general purpose credit card securitization transactions and a decrease in



net gain amortization related to prior securitization transactions. The decrease in net interest revenues was primarily attributable to a lower net interest
spread and a lower level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans.

In fiscal 2005, Servicing and securitization income decreased 16%, reflecting lower net interest revenues and Other revenue, partially offset by a lower Provision for consumer loan losses and higher Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net.
The decrease in net interest revenues was attributable to a lower level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans and a higher weighted average coupon rate paid to investors associated with the higher short-term interest rate
environment. The interest yield was relatively unchanged from fiscal 2004 as the impact of the increase in the prime rate was offset by a decline in higher rate loans due to improved credit quality and various pricing initiatives. The decrease in
Other revenue was primarily due to a lower level of securitized receivables and a decline in the fair value of the Company’s retained interests in securitized receivables as a result of an increase in bankruptcy notifications and its impact on
future charge-offs. The lower Provision for consumer loan losses was primarily attributable to a lower rate of net principal charge-offs related to the securitized general purpose credit card loan portfolio and a lower level of average securitized
general purpose credit card loans, partially offset by an increase in bankruptcy charge-offs. The increase in Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net, reflected the allocation of interchange revenue to certain securitization transactions and lower
fee net charge-offs, partially offset by lower assessed late payment and overlimit fees.

The net proceeds received from general purpose credit card asset securitizations were $8,738 million in fiscal 2006 and $7,240 million in fiscal 2005. The credit card asset securitization transactions completed in
fiscal 2006 have expected maturities ranging from approximately three to seven years from the date of issuance.

Net Interest Income.

Net interest income represents the difference between interest revenue derived from consumer loans and
short-term investment assets and interest expense incurred to finance those loans and assets. Assets, consisting primarily of consumer loans, currently earn interest revenue at both fixed rates and market-indexed variable rates. The Company incurs
interest expense at fixed and floating rates. Interest expense also includes the effects of any interest rate contracts entered into by the Company as part of its interest rate risk management program. This program is designed to reduce the
volatility of earnings resulting from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of consumer loans as well as the Company’s right, with notice to cardmembers, to reprice certain
fixed rate consumer loans to a new interest rate in the future.

Net interest
income increased 8% in fiscal 2006 due to an increase in Interest revenue, partially offset by an increase in Interest expense. The increase in Interest revenue was due to an increase in average owned general purpose credit card loans and a higher
interest yield. The increase in average owned general purpose credit card loans was due to the acquisition of Goldfish, record sales volume and a lower level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans. The increase in Interest expense
was primarily related to an increase in the Company’s average cost of borrowings and a higher level of average interest bearing liabilities, primarily to support the increase in average owned general purpose credit card loans.

Net interest income increased 15% in fiscal 2005 due to an increase in Interest revenue,
partially offset by an increase in Interest expense. The increase in Interest revenue was primarily due to an increase in average general purpose credit card loans, which was partly attributable to a higher level of securitization maturities and the
deferment of new securitization transactions due to the exploration of the potential spin-off of Discover in fiscal 2005. The increase in Interest expense was largely due to a higher level of average interest bearing liabilities, primarily to
support the increase in average general purpose credit card loans.



The following tables present analyses of Discover’s average balance sheets and interest rates in fiscal 2006, fiscal
2005 and fiscal 2004 and changes in net interest income during those fiscal years:

Rate/Volume Analysis.

Provision for Consumer Loan
Losses.

The Provision for consumer loan losses is the amount necessary to establish the allowance for consumer loan losses at a level that the Company believes is adequate to absorb estimated losses in its consumer
loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance for consumer loan losses is a significant estimate that represents management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in the owned consumer loan portfolio. The allowance for consumer loan
losses is primarily applicable to the owned homogeneous consumer credit card loan portfolio. The allowance is evaluated quarterly for adequacy and is established through a charge to the Provision for consumer loan losses. In estimating the allowance
for consumer loan losses, the Company uses a systematic and consistently applied approach. This process starts with a migration analysis (a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a consumer loan will progress through the various stages of
delinquency and ultimately charge-off) of delinquent and current consumer credit card accounts in order to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for consumer loan losses. The migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest
and fees reflected in consumer loans. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for consumer loan losses, management also considers factors that may impact credit losses, including current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies and
bankruptcy filings, account collection management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties.

The Company’s provision for consumer loan losses was $756 million, $878 million and $926 million for fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. The
Company’s allowance for consumer loan losses was $831 million at November 30, 2006 and $838 million at November 30, 2005.

The provision for consumer loan losses decreased 14% in fiscal 2006. The decrease reflected lower net charge-offs and a lower net reduction of reserves as compared with
the prior year. The decrease in net charge-offs primarily reflected a decline in bankruptcy filings following the federal bankruptcy legislation effective in October 2005 and improved portfolio credit quality. The net reduction in reserves in fiscal
2006 was approximately $71 million as compared with approximately $100 million in the prior year.

In fiscal 2005, the provision for consumer loan losses decreased 5%, primarily due to a higher net reduction of reserves and lower net charge-offs as compared with fiscal 2004 due to improvement in credit quality in
the



Company’s consumer loan portfolio, partially offset by the impact of higher bankruptcy filings in advance of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation
effective in October 2005. The net reduction in reserves in fiscal 2005 totaled approximately $100 million as compared with a net reduction of approximately $60 million in fiscal 2004.

Delinquencies and Charge-offs

.

General purpose credit card loans are considered delinquent when
contractual payments become 30 days past due. General purpose credit card loans generally are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due, except in the case of cardmember bankruptcies, probate
accounts and fraudulent transactions. Cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off at the end of the month 60 days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death but not later than the 180-day contractual time
frame. Fraudulent transactions are reported in consumer loans at their net realizable value upon receipt of notification of the fraud through a charge to operating expenses and are subsequently written off at the end of the month 90 days following
notification but not later than the contractual 180-day time frame. Loan delinquencies and charge-offs are affected by changes in economic conditions, account collection management and policy changes and may vary throughout the year due to seasonal
consumer spending and payment behaviors.

Delinquency rates in both the over
30-day and over 90-day categories and net principal charge-off rates were lower for both the owned and managed portfolios in fiscal 2006, reflecting strong portfolio credit quality and the continued favorable impact following federal bankruptcy
legislation effective in fiscal 2005 (see “Managed General Purpose Credit Card Loan Data” herein). While credit costs are expected to continue to rise, the Company expects charge-off rates to remain relatively low and reach between 4.5%
and 5.0% by the end of fiscal 2007.

In fiscal 2005, delinquency rates in both
the over 30-day and over 90-day categories and net principal charge-off rates were lower for both the owned and managed portfolios, reflecting improvements in portfolio credit quality (see “Managed General Purpose Credit Card Loan Data”
herein). The improvement in net principal charge-off rates was partially offset by an increase in bankruptcy charges-offs related to consumers filing for bankruptcy in advance of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation effective in October 2005.

In response to industry-wide regulatory guidance, the Company has increased
minimum payment requirements on certain general purpose credit card loans. Bank regulators have discretion to interpret the guidance or its application, and changes in such guidance or its application by the regulators could impact minimum payment
requirements. Increases in minimum payment requirements could negatively impact future levels of general purpose credit card loans and related interest and fee revenue and charge-offs.

The Company’s future charge-off rates and credit quality are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially from what has been discussed above. Factors that influence the provision for consumer loan losses include the level and direction of general purpose credit card loan delinquencies and charge-offs, changes in consumer spending and payment
behaviors, bankruptcy trends, regulatory changes or new guidance, the seasoning of the Company’s general purpose credit card loan portfolio, interest rate movements and their impact on consumer behavior, and the rate and magnitude of changes in
the Company’s general purpose credit card loan portfolio, including the overall mix of accounts, products and loan balances within the portfolio.

Non-Interest Expenses

.

Non-interest expenses increased 7% in fiscal 2006. Compensation and benefits expense increased 7% and
included Discover’s share ($10 million) of the incremental compensation expense related to equity awards to retirement-eligible employees (see “Other Items—Stock-Based Compensation” herein) as well as an increase in salaries and
wages. Fiscal 2005 included Discover’s share ($29 million) of the costs associated with senior management changes (see “Other Items—Senior Management Compensation Charges” herein). Information processing and communications
expense increased 10%, primarily due to higher data and transaction processing costs related to the acquisition of Goldfish in February 2006. Marketing and business development expense increased 3% due to increased marketing costs associated with
account



acquisitions, the launch of the Discover Business Card and higher advertising expenses due to the branding campaign launched at the end of the third quarter
of fiscal 2006. Professional services expense increased 25% due to higher legal fees and investments in infrastructure and technology.

Fiscal 2005’s non-interest expenses increased 9% from fiscal 2004, partially resulting from the acquisition of PULSE (see “Other Items—Business and Other
Acquisitions and Dispositions” herein). Compensation and benefits expense increased 15%, including Discover’s share ($29 million) of the costs associated with senior management changes, as well as an increase in personnel costs, including
salaries and benefits. Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non-interest expenses increased 7%. Marketing and business development expense increased 2% due to increased marketing and advertising costs. Professional services expense increased
12% due to higher consulting fees, partially related to the exploration of the potential spin-off of Discover in fiscal 2005 and an increase in legal and account collection fees. Other expenses increased 16%, primarily reflecting an increase in
certain operating expenses, including accruals for losses associated with cardmember fraud and higher legal accruals.

Seasonal Factors

.

Discover’s activities are affected by seasonal patterns of retail purchasing. Historically, a
substantial percentage of general purpose credit card loan growth occurs in the fourth calendar quarter, followed by a flattening or decline of these loans in the following calendar quarter. Merchant fees, therefore, historically have tended to
increase in the first fiscal quarter, reflecting higher sales activity in the month of December. Additionally, higher cardmember rewards incentives historically have been accrued for as a reduction of merchant and cardmember fee revenues in the
first fiscal quarter, reflecting seasonal growth in retail sales volume.

Managed General Purpose Credit Card Loan Data

.

The Company analyzes its financial performance on both a “managed” loan basis and as reported under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) (“owned” loan basis). Managed loan data assume that the Company’s securitized loan receivables have not been sold and present the results of the securitized loan receivables in the same manner as the
Company’s owned loans. The Company operates its Discover business and analyzes its financial performance on a managed basis. Accordingly, underwriting and servicing standards are comparable for both owned and securitized loans. The Company
believes that managed loan information is useful to investors because it provides information regarding the quality of loan origination and credit performance of the entire managed portfolio and allows investors to understand the related credit
risks inherent in owned loans and retained interests in securitizations. In addition, investors often request information on a managed basis, which provides a comparison with industry competitors.

The following table provides a reconciliation of owned and managed average loan balances,
returns on receivables, interest yields and interest rate spreads for the periods indicated:

Other Items.

Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

“

Considering the Effects of Prior
Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements”

(“SAB 108”). SAB 108 permits the Company to adjust for the cumulative effect of errors relating to prior years in the carrying amount
of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the current fiscal year, with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. SAB 108 also requires the adjustment of any prior quarterly
financial statements within the fiscal year of adoption for the effects of such errors on the quarters when the information is next presented. Such adjustments do not require previously filed reports with the SEC to be amended. Effective
August 31, 2006, the Company elected early application of SAB 108. In accordance with SAB 108, the Company has adjusted its opening retained earnings for fiscal 2006 and its financial results for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006 for
the items described below. The Company considers these adjustments to be immaterial to prior annual periods.

Trust Preferred Securities.

The Company adjusted its opening retained earnings for fiscal 2006 and its financial results for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006 to reflect a
change in its hedge accounting under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended (“SFAS No. 133”). The change is
being made following a clarification by the SEC of its interpretation of SFAS No. 133 related to the accounting for fair value hedges of fixed-rate trust preferred securities.

Since January 2005, the Company entered into various interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in its trust preferred
securities. The terms of the interest rate swaps and the corresponding trust preferred securities mirrored one another, and the Company determined in the past that the changes in the fair value of the swaps and hedged instruments were the same. The
Company applied the commonly used “short-cut method” in accounting for these fair value hedges and, therefore, did not reflect any gains or losses during the relevant periods. Based upon the SEC’s clarification of SFAS No. 133,
the Company determined that since it has the ability at its election to defer interest payments on its trust preferred securities, these swaps did not qualify for the short-cut method. These swaps performed as expected as effective economic hedges
of interest rate risk. The Company ended hedging of the interest rate risk on these trust preferred securities effective August 2006 and adjusted its financial results as if hedge accounting was never applied. Prospectively, the Company will manage
the interest rate risk on these securities as part of its overall asset liability management.

Compensation and Benefits.

The Company also adjusted its opening retained earnings for fiscal 2006 and its financial results for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006 for two
compensation and benefits accruals. Such accruals are related to (i) the overaccrual of certain payroll taxes in certain non-U.S. locations, primarily in the U.K., which arose in fiscal 2000 through fiscal 2006 and (ii) an adjustment to
the amortization expense associated with stock-based compensation awards, which arose in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004.

Impact of Adjustments.

The impact of each of the items noted above on fiscal 2006 opening Shareholders’ equity and Retained
earnings and on Net income for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2006 is presented below (dollars in millions):



The aggregate impact of these adjustments is summarized below (dollars in millions, except per share data):

Stock-Based Compensation.

The Company early adopted SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based
Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”), using the modified prospective approach as of December 1, 2004. SFAS No. 123R revised the fair value-based method of accounting for share-based payment liabilities, forfeitures and
modifications of stock-based awards and clarified guidance in several areas, including measuring fair value, classifying an award as equity or as a liability and attributing compensation cost to service periods. Upon adoption, the Company
recognized an $80 million gain ($49 million after-tax) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 resulting from the requirement to estimate forfeitures at the date of grant instead of recognizing
them as incurred. The cumulative effect gain increased both basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2005 by $0.05.

For stock-based awards issued prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company’s accounting policy for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees was to
recognize compensation cost over the service period specified in the award terms. The Company accelerates any unrecognized compensation cost for such awards if and when a retirement-eligible employee leaves the Company. For stock-based awards made
to retirement-eligible employees during fiscal 2005, the Company recognized compensation expense for such awards on the date of grant.



For fiscal 2005 year-end stock-based compensation awards that were granted to retirement-eligible employees in December
2005, the Company recognized the compensation cost for such awards at the date of grant instead of over the service period specified in the award terms. As a result, the Company recorded non-cash incremental compensation expenses of approximately
$270 million in fiscal 2006 for stock-based awards granted to retirement-eligible employees as part of the fiscal 2005 year-end award process. These incremental expenses were included within Compensation and benefits expense and reduced income
before taxes within the Institutional Securities ($190 million), Global Wealth Management Group ($50 million), Asset Management ($20 million) and Discover ($10 million) business segments.

Additionally, based on interpretive guidance related to SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company changed its
accounting policy for expensing the cost of anticipated fiscal 2006 year-end equity awards that were granted to retirement-eligible employees in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Effective December 1, 2005, the Company accrues the estimated
cost of these awards over the course of the current fiscal year rather than expensing the awards on the date of grant (which occurred in December 2006).

As a result, fiscal 2006 stock-based compensation expense primarily included the following costs:

•

amortization of fiscal 2003 year-end awards;

•

amortization of fiscal 2004 year-end awards;

•

amortization of fiscal 2005 year-end awards to non-retirement eligible employees;

•

the full cost of fiscal 2005 year-end awards to retirement eligible employees (made in December 2005); and

•

the full cost of fiscal 2006 year-end awards to retirement eligible employees (made in December 2006).

Fiscal 2007 stock-based compensation expense will primarily include the following costs:

•

amortization of fiscal 2004 year-end awards;

•

amortization of fiscal 2005 year-end awards to non-retirement eligible employees;

•

amortization of fiscal 2006 year-end awards to non-retirement eligible employees; and

•

the full cost of fiscal 2007 year-end awards to retirement eligible employees (expected to be made in December 2007).

Fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 year-end awards are generally amortized over three and four
years, while fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 year-end awards are generally amortized over two and three years.

Discontinued Operations.

As described
in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, on August 17, 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved management’s recommendation to sell the Company’s non-core aircraft leasing business. In
connection with this action, the aircraft leasing business was classified as “held for sale” under the provisions of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS
No. 144”), and reported as discontinued operations in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

On January 30, 2006, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement under which it would sell its aircraft leasing business to Terra Firma, a
European private equity group, for approximately $2.5 billion in cash and the assumption of liabilities. The sale was completed on March 24, 2006. The results for discontinued operations in fiscal 2006 include a loss of $125 million ($75
million after-tax) related to the impact of the finalization of the sales proceeds and balance sheet adjustments related to the closing. The results for fiscal 2005 reflected a charge of $509 million ($316 million after-tax) to reflect the
write-down of the aircraft leasing business to its estimated fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 144.



In fiscal 2004, the Company entered into agreements for the sale of certain aircraft. Accordingly, the Company designated
such aircraft as “held for sale” and recorded a $42 million pre-tax loss related to the write-down of these aircraft to fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 144. As of February 3, 2005, all of these aircraft were sold. In
addition, during fiscal 2004, the Company recorded aircraft impairment charges in accordance with SFAS No. 144.

The table below provides information regarding the pre-tax loss on discontinued operations and the aircraft impairment charges that are included in these amounts (dollars
in millions):

Fiscal 2006 reflected a net loss of
$25 million on discontinued operations, which included the results of operations of the aircraft leasing business through the date of sale. Fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 reflected a net loss on discontinued operations of $302 million and $103 million,
respectively.

Discover Spin-off.

On December 19, 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved
the spin-off of Discover in order to enhance shareholder value. The Discover Spin-off will allow the Company to focus its efforts on more closely aligned firm-wide strategic priorities within its Institutional Securities, Global Wealth Management
Group and Asset Management business segments. The Discover Spin-off is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions, and is expected to occur in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. At the time of the Discover Spin-off, shareholders of
the Company will receive shares in Discover on a tax-free basis.

Coleman Litigation.

On May 8, 2003, Coleman (Parent) Holdings Inc. (“CPH”) filed a complaint against the Company in the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit for
Palm Beach County, Florida. The complaint relates to the 1998 merger between The Coleman Company, Inc. (“Coleman”) and Sunbeam, Inc. (“Sunbeam”). The complaint, as amended, alleges that CPH was induced to agree to the transaction
with Sunbeam based on certain financial misrepresentations, and it asserts claims against the Company for aiding and abetting fraud, conspiracy and punitive damages. Shortly before trial, which commenced in April 2005, the trial court granted, in
part, a motion for entry of a default judgment against the Company and ordered that portions of CPH’s complaint, including those setting forth CPH’s primary allegations against the Company, be read to the jury and deemed established for
all purposes in the action. In May 2005, the jury returned a verdict in favor of CPH and awarded CPH $604 million in compensatory damages and $850 million in punitive damages. On June 23, 2005, the trial court issued a final judgment in favor
of CPH in the amount of $1,578 million, which includes prejudgment interest and excludes certain payments received by CPH in settlement of related claims against others. On June 27, 2005, the Company filed a notice of appeal with the District
Court of Appeal for the Fourth District of Florida (the “Court of Appeal”) and posted a supersedeas bond, which automatically stayed execution of the judgment pending appeal. Included in cash and securities deposited with clearing
organizations or segregated under federal and other regulations or requirements in the consolidated statement of financial condition is $1,840 million of money market deposits that have been pledged to obtain the supersedeas bond. The Company filed
its initial brief in support of its appeal on December 7, 2005, and, on June 28, 2006, the Court of Appeal heard oral argument. The Company’s appeal seeks to reverse the judgment of the trial court on several grounds and asks that the
case be remanded for entry of a judgment in favor of the Company or, in the alternative, for a new trial.

The Company believes, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is probable that the compensatory and punitive damages awards will be overturned on appeal and the case remanded for a new trial. Taking into
account the advice of outside counsel, the Company is maintaining a reserve of $360 million for the Coleman litigation, which it believes to be a reasonable estimate, under SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (“SFAS
No. 5”), of the low end of the range of its probable exposure in the event the judgment is overturned and the case remanded for a new trial. If the compensatory and/or punitive awards are ultimately upheld on appeal, in whole or in part,
the Company may incur an additional expense equal to the difference between the amount affirmed on appeal (and post-judgment interest thereon) and the amount of the reserve. While the Company cannot predict with certainty the amount of such
additional expense, such additional expense could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company and/or the Company’s or Institutional Securities’ operating results and cash flows for a particular
future period, and the upper end of the range could exceed $1.4 billion. For further information, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.

Insurance Settlement.

On September 11, 2001, the U.S. experienced terrorist attacks targeted against New York City and Washington, D.C. The attacks in New York resulted in the destruction of the World Trade Center complex, where
approximately 3,700 of the Company’s employees were located, and the temporary closing of the debt and equity financial markets in the U.S. Through the implementation of its business recovery plans, the Company relocated its displaced employees
to other facilities.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company settled
its claim with its insurance carriers related to the events of September 11, 2001. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $251 million as the insurance recovery was in excess of previously recognized costs related to the terrorist attacks
(primarily write-offs of leasehold improvements and destroyed technology and telecommunications equipment in the World Trade Center complex, employee relocation and certain other employee-related expenditures).

The pre-tax gain was recorded as a reduction to non-interest expenses and is included within
the Global Wealth Management Group ($198 million), Asset Management ($43 million) and Institutional Securities ($10 million) business segments. The insurance settlement was allocated to the respective segments in accordance with the relative damages
sustained by each segment.



Lease Adjustment.

Prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company did not record the effects of scheduled rent increases and rent-free periods for certain real estate leases on a
straight-line basis. In addition, the Company had been accounting for certain tenant improvement allowances as reductions to the related leasehold improvements instead of recording funds received as deferred rent and amortizing them as reductions to
lease expense over the lease term. In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company changed its method of accounting for these rent escalation clauses, rent-free periods and tenant improvement allowances to properly reflect lease expense over the
lease term on a straight-line basis. The impact of this correction resulted in the Company recording $109 million of additional rent expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The impact of this change was included within non-interest expenses and
reduced income before taxes within the Institutional Securities ($71 million), Global Wealth Management Group ($29 million), Asset Management ($5 million) and Discover ($4 million) business segments. The impact of this correction was not material to
the pre-tax income of each of the segments or to the Company.

Senior
Management Compensation Charges.

Compensation and benefits expense in
fiscal 2005 included charges for certain members of senior management related to severance and new hires, which increased non-interest expenses by approximately $311 million. These compensation charges were allocated to the Company’s business
segments as follows: Institutional Securities ($193 million), Global Wealth Management Group ($48 million), Asset Management ($41 million) and Discover ($29 million).

Tax Matters.

Income Tax Examinations.

The Company is under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other tax authorities in certain countries, such as Japan and the
U.K., and states in which the Company has significant business operations, such as New York. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction; for example, the current IRS examination covers 1999-2005. The Company regularly assesses the
likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years’ examinations. The Company has established tax reserves that the Company believes are adequate in relation to the
potential for additional assessments. Once established, the Company adjusts tax reserves only when more information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. The Company believes that the resolution of tax matters
will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although a resolution could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statement of income for a particular future period and on the
Company’s effective income tax rate for any period in which such resolution occurs.

Fiscal 2006 included an income tax benefit of $280 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, related to the resolution of the IRS examination of years 1994-1998.

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

The American Jobs Creation Act, adopted on October 22, 2004, provided for a special
one-time tax deduction, or dividend received deduction, of 85% of qualifying foreign earnings that are repatriated in either a company’s last tax year that began before the enactment date or the first tax year that begins during the one-year
period beginning on the enactment date. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $309 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, resulting from the Company’s repatriation of approximately $4.0 billion of
qualifying foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. The $309 million tax benefit resulted from the reversal of net deferred tax liabilities previously provided under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes,” net of additional taxes associated with these qualifying earnings.



Investments in Unconsolidated Investees.

The Company invests in unconsolidated investees that own synthetic fuel production plants. The Company accounts for these investments under
the equity method of accounting. The Company’s share of the operating losses generated by these investments is recorded within Losses from unconsolidated investees, and the tax credits and the tax benefits associated with these operating losses
are recorded within the Provision for income taxes.

In fiscal 2006, fiscal
2005 and fiscal 2004, the losses from unconsolidated investees were more than offset by the respective tax credits and tax benefits on the losses. The table below provides information regarding the losses from unconsolidated investees, tax credits
and tax benefits on the losses:

Under the current tax law, synthetic
fuels tax credits are granted under Section 45K of the Internal Revenue Code. Synthetic fuels tax credits are available in full only when the price of oil is less than a base price specified by the tax code, as adjusted for inflation
(“Base Price”). The Base Price for each calendar year is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury by April 1 of the following year. If the annual average price of a barrel of oil in 2006 or future years exceeds the applicable Base
Price, the synthetic fuels tax credits generated by the Company’s synthetic fuel facilities will be phased out, on a ratable basis, over the phase-out range. Synthetic fuels tax credits realized in prior years are not affected by this
limitation. Due to the high level of crude oil prices in fiscal 2006 and continued uncertainty regarding the value of tax credits associated with synthetic fuel investments, all of the Company’s investees idled production at their synthetic
fuel production facilities during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2006. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, all of the Company’s investees began production at their synthetic fuel production facilities, largely due to a decline in the
level of crude oil prices in the fourth quarter as compared with the second and third quarters of fiscal 2006. Additionally, based on fiscal year to date and futures prices at November 30, 2006, the Company estimates that there will be a
partial phase-out of tax credits earned in fiscal 2006. The impact of this anticipated partial phase-out is included within Losses from unconsolidated investees and the Provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2006.

The Company has entered into derivative contracts designed to reduce its
exposure to rising oil prices and the potential phase-out of the synthetic fuels tax credits. Changes in fair value relative to these derivative contracts are included within Principal transactions—trading revenues.

Asset Management and Account Fees.

Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company was improperly recognizing certain
management fees, account fees and related compensation expense paid at the beginning of the relevant contract periods, which is when such fees were billed. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company changed its method of accounting for such
fees to properly recognize such fees and related expenses over the relevant contract period, generally quarterly or annually. As a result of the change, the Company’s results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 included an adjustment to
reflect the cumulative impact of the deferral of certain management fees, account fees and related compensation expense paid to global representatives. The impact of this change reduced net revenues by $107 million, non-interest expenses by $27
million and income before taxes by $80 million, at both the Company and the Global Wealth Management Group business segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Such adjustment reduced fiscal 2004 net income by approximately $50 million and basic
and diluted earnings per share by $0.05.



Pension Plans.

Contributions.

The Company made contributions of $114 million and $272 million to its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans
in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. These contributions were funded with cash from operations and were recorded as a component of prepaid pension benefit cost in the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition.

The Company determines the amount of its pension contributions to its funded
plans by considering several factors, including the level of plan assets relative to plan liabilities, expected plan liquidity needs and expected future contribution requirements. The Company’s policy is to fund at least the amounts sufficient
to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax regulations; for example, in the U.S., the minimum required contribution under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”). At
November 30, 2006, there were no minimum required ERISA contributions for the Company’s U.S. pension plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Qualified Plan”). Liabilities for benefits
payable under its unfunded supplementary plans are accrued by the Company and are funded when paid to the beneficiaries.

Pension Expense.

In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company recognizes the compensation cost of employee’s pension benefits
(including prior service cost) over the employee’s approximate service period. This process involves making certain estimates and assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.

The assumed discount rate, which reflects the rates at which pension benefits could be
effectively settled, is used to measure the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and to calculate the service cost and interest cost. For fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, the assumed discount rate for all U.S. plans was selected by the Company,
in consultation with its independent actuaries, using a pension discount yield curve based on the characteristics of the Qualified Plan liabilities. The pension discount yield curve represents spot discount yields based on the duration implicit in a
representative broad-based Aa corporate bond universe of high-quality fixed income investments. It includes only bonds of reasonable issue size and excludes certain types of bonds, such as callable bonds. As of November 30, 2006, the Qualified
Plan liabilities represented 79% of the total liabilities of the Company’s U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans combined. The Company, in consultation with its independent actuaries, set the assumed discount rates used for non-U.S. pension
plans based on the nature of liabilities, local economic environments and available bond indices.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets represents the Company’s best estimate of the long-term return on plan assets and generally was estimated by computing a weighted average return of the underlying
long-term expected returns on the different asset classes based on the target asset allocations and taking into consideration estimated expenses and the benefits of diversification and the rebalancing of the portfolio. This rate is expected to
remain the same from one year to the next, but is adjusted when there is a significant change in the target asset allocation, the fees and expenses paid by the plan or market conditions.

As of November 30, 2006, the Qualified Plan assets represented 89% of the total assets of the Company’s U.S. and non-U.S. pension
plans combined. To better align the duration of plan assets with the duration of plan liabilities, the Qualified Plan’s target asset allocation policy was changed in September 2005 from 50%/50% equity/fixed income to 45%/55% equity/fixed
income, and the duration of the fixed income portfolio was extended from 13 to 18 years. As a result, the Company, in consultation with its independent investment consultants and actuaries, lowered its expected long-term rate of return on its
Qualified Plan assets from 7.00% to 6.75% for fiscal 2006 (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). The impact of this change was not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations in fiscal 2006. The preliminary
expected long-term rate of return on Qualified Plan assets remains unchanged at 6.75% for fiscal 2007.



The Company’s fiscal 2006 expected long-term rate of return on assets for its Qualified Plan was based on the
following target asset allocation:

(1)

These returns do not include the impact of diversification on the overall expected portfolio return.

Each year the Company compares its initial estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the Qualified Plan (and adjusts,
if necessary) with a portfolio return calculator model (the “Portfolio Model”) that produces a range of expected returns for the portfolio. Return assumptions used are forward-looking gross returns that are not developed solely by an
examination of historical returns. The Portfolio Model begins with the current U.S. Treasury yield curve, recognizing that expected returns on bonds are heavily influenced by the current level of yields. Corporate bond spreads and equity risk
premiums, based on current market conditions, are then added to develop the return expectations for each asset class. The resulting expected portfolio investment is then adjusted downward to reflect assumed expenses, which include investment and
transaction fees that typically are paid from plan assets, added to the cost basis or subtracted from sale proceeds, as well as administrative expenses paid from plan assets.

The Company uses the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets to compute the expected return on assets component of pension expense.
For the Qualified Plan, expected returns are computed based on a market-related value of assets. The market-related value of assets is a smoothed actuarial value of assets equal to a moving average of market values in which investment income is
recognized over a five-year period. The market-related value of assets must be no greater than 120% and no less than 80% of the market value of assets. Investment income equal to the expected return on the plan’s assets as calculated for the
prior year’s expense is recognized immediately. Any difference between the actual investment income (on a market-value basis) and the expected return is recognized over a five-year period in accordance with SFAS No. 87,
“Employers’ Accounting for Pensions.”

Other assumptions,
including mortality rates, long-term salary growth and employee turnover rates, are set by the Company in consultation with its independent actuaries. These assumptions are tested every year by monitoring gains and losses, performing assumption
studies as needed, and monitoring Company objectives and actuarial trends. These assumptions are adjusted whenever necessary.

The Company amortizes (as a component of pension expense) unrecognized net gains and losses over the average future service of active participants (5 to 20 years
depending upon the plan) to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. The loss amortization component for the U.S. and the non-U.S. pension plans was $60
million for fiscal 2006 (33% of pension expense) and $49 million for fiscal 2005 (31% of pension expense).

Accounting Developments.

Determining the Variability in Variable Interest Entities.

In April 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position No. FIN 46(R)-6, “Determining
the Variability to Be Considered in Applying FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)” (“FSP FIN 46(R)-6”). FSP FIN 46(R)-6 requires that the determination of the variability to be considered in applying FASB Interpretation
No. 46 (revised December 2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46R”), be based on an analysis of the design of the



entity. In evaluating whether an interest with a variable interest entity creates or absorbs variability, FSP FIN 46(R)-6 focuses on the role of a
contract or arrangement in the design of an entity, regardless of its legal form or accounting classification. The Company adopted the guidance in FSP FIN 46(R)-6 prospectively on September 1, 2006 to all entities that the
Company first becomes involved with and to all entities previously required to be analyzed under FIN 46R when a reconsideration event has occurred under paragraph 7 of FIN 46R. The adoption of FSP FIN 46(R)-6 did not have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Limited Partnerships.

In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 04-5, “Determining Whether a General Partner, or the
General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights” (“EITF Issue No. 04-5”). Under the provisions of EITF Issue No. 04-5, a general partner in a
limited partnership is presumed to control that limited partnership and, therefore, should include the limited partnership in its consolidated financial statements, regardless of the amount or extent of the general partner’s interest unless a
majority of the limited partners can vote to dissolve or liquidate the partnership or otherwise remove the general partner without having to show cause or the limited partners have substantive participating rights that can overcome the presumption
of control by the general partner. EITF Issue No. 04-5 was effective immediately for all newly formed limited partnerships and existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements have been modified. For all other existing limited
partnerships for which the partnership agreements have not been modified, the Company adopted EITF Issue No. 04-5 on December 1, 2006. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 04-5 on December 1, 2006 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Accounting for Certain
Hybrid Financial Instruments.

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments” (“SFAS No. 155”), which amends SFAS No. 133 and
SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities” (“SFAS No. 140”). SFAS No. 155 permits hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative that
would otherwise require bifurcation to irrevocably be accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of income. The fair value election may be applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis. SFAS No. 155 also
eliminates a restriction on the passive derivative instruments that a qualifying special purpose entity may hold. The Company adopted SFAS No. 155 on December 1, 2006 and has elected to fair value only certain hybrid financial instruments
acquired, issued or subject to a remeasurement event after December 1, 2006.

Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets.

In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140”
(“SFAS No. 156”). SFAS No. 156 requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. The standard permits an entity to subsequently measure each
class of servicing assets or servicing liabilities at fair value and report changes in fair value in the statement of income in the period in which the changes occur. The Company adopted SFAS No. 156 on December 1, 2006 and has elected to
fair value certain servicing rights held as of the date of adoption. This election did not have a material impact on the Company’s opening balance of Retained earnings as of December 1, 2006. The Company will also elect to fair value certain
servicing rights acquired after December 1, 2006.

Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”).
FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for the Company as
of December 1, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting FIN 48.



Fair Value Measurements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 157. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In addition, SFAS No. 157 disallows the use of block discounts for large holdings of
unrestricted financial instruments where quoted prices are readily and regularly available in an active market, and nullifies select guidance provided by EITF Issue No. 02-3, which prohibited the recognition of trading gains or losses at the
inception of a derivative contract, unless the fair value of such derivative is obtained from a quoted market price, or other valuation technique that incorporates observable market data. SFAS No. 157 also requires the Company to consider its
own credit spreads when measuring the fair value of liabilities, including derivatives. Effective December 1, 2006, the Company elected early adoption of SFAS No. 157. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 157 related to block
discounts and EITF Issue No. 02-3, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of approximately $80 million after-tax as an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings as of December 1, 2006, which was primarily associated
with EITF Issue No. 02-3. The impact of considering the Company’s own credit spreads when measuring the fair value of liabilities, including derivatives, did not have a material impact on fair value measurements at the date of adoption.
With the adoption of SFAS No. 157, the Company will no longer apply the revenue recognition criteria of EITF Issue No. 02-3. The Company is currently unable to quantify the impact, if any, that this change in accounting methodology will have on its
results of operations in fiscal 2007, since such impact will be dependent upon, among other things, the nature, volume and size of structured derivative transactions that the Company may enter into during fiscal 2007.

Employee Benefit Plans.

In September 2006, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)” (“SFAS No. 158”). Among other items, SFAS
No. 158 requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity’s defined benefit and postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the financial statements and requires the measurement of defined benefit and
postretirement plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year. SFAS No. 158’s requirement to recognize the funded status in the financial statements is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15,
2006, and its requirement to use the fiscal year-end date as the measurement date is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 158 will have on its consolidated
results of operations and cash flows. However, if SFAS No. 158 were to be applied by the Company as of November 30, 2006, based on a September 30, 2006 measurement date, the effect on its consolidated statement of financial position
would be an after-tax charge to Shareholders’ equity of approximately $355 million.



Critical Accounting Policies.

The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the Company to make estimates
and assumptions (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company believes that of its accounting policies (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.

Financial Instruments Used For Trading and Investment.

Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased, which include
cash and derivative products, are recorded at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition, and gains and losses are reflected in Principal transactions trading and investment revenues in the consolidated statements of income.
Fair value is the amount at which financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

The fair value of the Company’s Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased are generally based on
observable market prices, observable market parameters or derived from such prices or parameters based on bid prices or parameters for Financial instruments owned and ask prices or parameters for Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased. In the
case of financial instruments transacted on recognized exchanges, the observable prices represent quotations for completed transactions from the exchange on which the financial instrument is principally traded. Bid prices represent the highest price
a buyer is willing to pay for a financial instrument at a particular time. Ask prices represent the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a financial instrument at a particular time.

A substantial percentage of the fair value of the Company’s Financial instruments owned
and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased is based on observable market prices, observable market parameters, or is derived from such prices or parameters. The availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from
product to product. Where available, observable market prices and pricing parameters in a product (or a related product) may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment. In certain markets, observable market prices or
market parameters are not available for all products, and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product. These techniques involve some degree of judgment.

The price transparency of the particular product will determine the degree of judgment
involved in determining the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments. Price transparency is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of product, whether it is a new product and not yet established in the
marketplace, and the characteristics particular to the transaction. Products for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters will generally
have a higher degree of price transparency. By contrast, products that are thinly traded or not quoted will generally have reduced to no price transparency. Even in normally active markets, the price transparency for actively quoted instruments may
be reduced for periods of time during periods of market dislocation. Alternatively, in thinly quoted markets, the participation of market-makers willing to purchase and sell a product provides a source of transparency for products that otherwise are
not actively quoted or during periods of market dislocation.

The
Company’s cash products include securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, other sovereign debt obligations, corporate and other debt securities, corporate equity securities, exchange traded funds and physical commodities. The
fair value of these products is based principally on observable market prices or is derived using observable market parameters. These products generally do not entail a significant degree of judgment in determining fair value. Examples of products
for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters include securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, exchange traded corporate
equity securities, most municipal debt securities, most corporate debt securities, most high-yield debt securities, physical commodities, certain tradable loan products and most mortgage-backed securities.



In certain circumstances, principally involving loan products and other financial instruments held for securitization
transactions, the Company determines fair value from within the range of bid and ask prices such that fair value indicates the value likely to be realized in a current market transaction. Bid prices reflect the price that the Company and others pay,
or stand ready to pay, to originators of such assets. Ask prices represent the prices that the Company and others require to sell such assets to the entities that acquire the financial instruments for purposes of completing the securitization
transactions. Generally, the fair value of such acquired assets is based upon the bid price in the market for the instrument or similar instruments. In general, the loans and similar assets are valued at bid pricing levels until structuring of the
related securitization is substantially complete and such that the value likely to be realized in a current transaction is consistent with the price that a securitization entity will pay to acquire the financial instruments. Factors affecting
securitized value and investor demand relating specifically to loan products include, but are not limited to, loan type, underlying property type and geographic location, loan interest rate, loan to value ratios, debt service coverage ratio,
investor demand and credit enhancement levels.

In addition, some cash products
exhibit little or no price transparency, and the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Examples of cash products with little or no price transparency include certain high-yield debt, certain collateralized mortgage obligations, certain
tradable loan products, distressed debt securities (i.e., securities of issuers encountering financial difficulties, including bankruptcy or insolvency) and equity securities that are not publicly traded. Generally, the fair value of these
types of cash products is determined using one of several valuation techniques appropriate for the product, which can include cash flow analysis, revenue or net income analysis, default recovery analysis (i.e., analysis of the likelihood of default
and the potential for recovery) and other analyses applied consistently.

The
following table presents the valuation of the Company’s cash products included within Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased by level of price transparency (dollars in millions):

The Company’s derivative products
include exchange traded and OTC derivatives. Exchange traded derivatives have valuation attributes similar to the cash products valued using observable market prices or market parameters described above. OTC derivatives, whose fair value is derived
using pricing models, include a wide variety of instruments, such as interest rate swap and option contracts, foreign currency option contracts, credit and equity swap and option contracts, and commodity swap and option contracts.

The following table presents the fair value of the Company’s exchange traded and OTC
derivatives included within Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased (dollars in millions):

The fair value of OTC derivative
contracts is derived primarily using pricing models, which may require multiple market input parameters. Where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for credit quality and market liquidity. These adjustments are applied on a
consistent basis and are based upon observable market data



where available. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 157 on December 1, 2006, the Company followed the provisions of EITF Issue No. 02-3 (see
“Other Items—Accounting Developments” herein). Under EITF Issue No. 02-3, in the absence of observable market prices or parameters in an active market, observable prices or parameters of other comparable current market
transactions, or other observable data supporting a fair value based on a pricing model at the inception of a contract, revenue recognition at the inception of an OTC derivative financial instrument is not permitted. Such revenue is recognized in
income at the earlier of when there is market value observability or at the end of the contract period. In the absence of observable market prices or parameters in an active market, observable prices or parameters of other comparable current market
transactions, or other observable data supporting a fair value based on a pricing model at the inception of a contract, fair value is based on the transaction price. The Company also uses pricing models to manage the risks introduced by OTC
derivatives. Depending on the product and the terms of the transaction, the fair value of OTC derivative products can be modeled using a series of techniques, including closed-form analytic formulae, such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model,
simulation models or a combination thereof, applied consistently. In the case of more established derivative products, the pricing models used by the Company are widely accepted by the financial services industry. Pricing models take into account
the contract terms, including the maturity, as well as market parameters such as interest rates, volatility and the creditworthiness of the counterparty.

Many pricing models do not entail material subjectivity because the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant judgment, and the pricing inputs are observed
from actively quoted markets, as is the case for generic interest rate swap and option contracts. A substantial majority of OTC derivative products valued by the Company using pricing models fall into this category. Other derivative products,
typically the newest and most complex products, will require more judgment in the implementation of the modeling technique applied due to the complexity of the modeling assumptions and the reduced price transparency surrounding the model’s
market parameters. The Company manages its market exposure for OTC derivative products primarily by entering into offsetting derivative contracts or other related financial instruments. The Company’s trading divisions, the Financial Control
Department and the Market Risk Department continuously monitor the price changes of the OTC derivatives in relation to the offsetting positions. For a further discussion of the price transparency of the Company’s OTC derivative products, see
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management—Credit Risk” in Part II, Item 7A.

Equity and debt investments purchased in connection with private equity and other principal investment activities initially are valued at cost to approximate fair value.
The carrying value of such investments is adjusted when changes in the underlying fair values are readily ascertainable, generally as evidenced by observable market prices or transactions that directly affect the value of such investments. Downward
adjustments relating to such investments are made in the event that the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value. The Company’s partnership interests, including general partnership and limited partnership interests
in real estate funds, are included within Other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition and are recorded at fair value based upon changes in the fair value of the underlying partnership’s net assets.

The Company employs control processes to validate the fair value of its financial
instruments, including those derived from pricing models. These control processes are designed to assure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable market prices or market-based parameters wherever possible. In the event
that market prices or parameters are not available, the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable. These control processes include
reviews of the pricing model’s theoretical soundness and appropriateness by Company personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks. Additionally, groups independent from the trading divisions within the Financial
Control and Market Risk Departments participate in the review and validation of the fair values generated from pricing models, as appropriate. Where a pricing model is used to determine fair value, recently executed comparable transactions and other
observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model. Consistent with market practice, the Company has individually negotiated agreements with certain counterparties to exchange collateral
(“margining”) based on the level of fair values of the derivative contracts they have executed. Through this margining process, one party or



both parties to a derivative contract provides the other party with information about the fair value of the derivative contract to calculate the amount of
collateral required. This sharing of fair value information provides additional support of the Company’s recorded fair value for the relevant OTC derivative products. For certain OTC derivative products, the Company, along with other market
participants, contributes derivative pricing information to aggregation services that synthesize the data and make it accessible to subscribers. This information is then used to evaluate the fair value of these OTC derivative products. For more
information regarding the Company’s risk management practices, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management” in Part II, Item 7A.

Allowance for Consumer Loan Losses.

The allowance for consumer loan losses in the Company’s Discover business is
established through a charge to the provision for consumer loan losses. Provisions are made to reserve for estimated losses in outstanding loan balances. The allowance for consumer loan losses is a significant estimate that represents
management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in the consumer loan portfolio. The allowance for consumer loan losses is primarily applicable to the owned homogeneous consumer credit card loan portfolio and is evaluated quarterly for
adequacy.

In estimating the allowance for consumer loan losses, the Company
uses a systematic and consistently applied approach. This process starts with a migration analysis (a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a consumer loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off)
of delinquent and current consumer credit card accounts in order to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for consumer loan losses. The migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in consumer loans.
In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for consumer loan losses, management also considers factors that may impact credit losses, including current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings, account collection
management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties. A provision for consumer loan losses is charged against earnings to maintain the allowance for consumer loan losses at an
appropriate level. The use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for consumer loan losses (see “Discover—Provision for Consumer Loan Losses” herein).

Legal, Regulatory and Tax Contingencies.

In the normal course of business, the Company has been named, from time to time, as a
defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions
include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the issuers that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress.

The Company is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews,
investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the Company’s business, including, among other matters, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse
judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. The number of these reviews, investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry, including the Company.

Reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on
a case-by-case basis and represent an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, and the opinions and views of internal and external
legal counsel. Given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, the



Company cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters, how such matters will be resolved, when they will
ultimately be resolved or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be.

The Company is subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and
subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. The Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for
income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or
audit. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years’ examinations, and tax reserves are established as appropriate.

The Company establishes reserves for potential losses that may arise out of litigation,
regulatory proceedings and tax audits to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated in accordance with SFAS No. 5. Once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs
requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of a legal claim, tax assessment or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded reserves, if any.

See Notes 9 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on
legal proceedings and tax examinations.

Special Purpose Entities.

The Company enters into a variety of transactions with special purpose
entities (“SPE”), primarily in connection with securitization activities. The Company engages in securitization activities related to commercial and residential mortgage loans, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate
bonds and loans, municipal bonds, credit card loans and other types of financial instruments. In most cases, these SPEs are deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIE”). Unless a VIE is determined to be a qualifying special purpose
entity (“QSPE”), the Company is required under accounting guidance to perform an analysis of each VIE at the date upon which the Company becomes involved with it to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, in
which case the Company must consolidate the VIE. QSPEs are not consolidated. The determination of whether an SPE meets the accounting requirements of a QSPE requires significant judgment, particularly in evaluating whether the permitted activities
of the SPE are significantly limited and in determining whether derivatives held by the SPE are passive and nonexcessive. In addition, the analysis involved in determining whether an entity is a VIE, and in determining the primary beneficiary of a
VIE, also requires significant judgment.

Certain Factors Affecting Results
of Operations.

The Company’s results of operations may be materially
affected by market fluctuations and by economic factors. In addition, results of operations in the past have been, and in the future may continue to be, materially affected by many factors of a global nature, including political, economic and market
conditions; the availability and cost of capital; the level and volatility of equity prices, commodity prices and interest rates; currency values and other market indices; technological changes and events; the availability and cost of credit;
inflation; and investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets. In addition, there continues to be a heightened level of legislative, legal and regulatory developments related to the financial services industry that potentially could
increase costs, thereby affecting future results of operations. Such factors also may have an impact on the Company’s ability to achieve its strategic objectives on a global basis. For a further discussion of these and other important factors
that could affect the Company’s business, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.



Liquidity and Capital Resources.

The Company’s senior management establishes the overall liquidity and capital policies of the Company. Through various risk and control
committees, the Company’s senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity and interest rate and currency sensitivity of the
Company’s asset and liability position. These committees, along with the Company’s Treasury Department and other control groups, also assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that the Company’s business activities
have on its consolidated balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure, thereby helping to ensure that its business activities are integrated with the Company’s liquidity and capital policies. For a description of the Company’s other
principal risks and how they are monitored and managed, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management” in Part II, Item 7A.

The Company’s liquidity and funding risk management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that the Company may be unable
to access adequate financing to service its financial obligations when they come due without material, adverse franchise or business impact. The key objectives of the liquidity and funding risk management framework are to support the successful
execution of the Company’s business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle and during periods of financial distress. The principal elements of the Company’s liquidity framework are the cash
capital policy, the liquidity reserve and stress testing through the contingency funding plan. Comprehensive financing guidelines (collateralized funding, long-term funding strategy, surplus capacity, diversification, staggered maturities and
committed credit facilities) support the Company’s target liquidity profile.

The Balance Sheet.

The Company monitors and evaluates the
composition and size of its balance sheet. Given the nature of the Company’s market-making and customer financing activities, the size of the balance sheet fluctuates from time to time. A substantial portion of the Company’s total assets
consists of highly liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from its Institutional Securities sales and trading activities. The highly liquid nature of these assets provides the Company with flexibility in
financing and managing its business.

The Company’s total assets increased
to $1,120,645 million at November 30, 2006 from $898,523 million at November 30, 2005. The increase was primarily due to increases in financial instruments owned (largely driven by increases in corporate and other debt and corporate
equities), securities borrowed, receivables from customers, and securities received as collateral. The increases were largely the result of an increase in client business opportunities.

Balance sheet leverage ratios are one indicator of capital adequacy when viewed in the
context of a company’s overall liquidity and capital policies. The Company views the adjusted leverage ratio as a more relevant measure of financial risk when comparing financial services firms and evaluating leverage trends. The Company has
adopted a definition of adjusted assets that excludes certain self-funded assets considered to have minimal market, credit and/or liquidity risk. These low-risk assets generally are attributable to the Company’s matched book and securities
lending businesses. Adjusted assets are calculated by reducing gross assets by aggregate resale agreements and securities borrowed less non-derivative short positions and assets recorded under certain provisions of SFAS No. 140 and FIN 46R. The
adjusted leverage ratio reflects the deduction from shareholders’ equity of the amount of equity used to support goodwill and intangible assets (as the Company does not view this amount of equity as available to support its risk capital needs).
In addition, the Company views junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts as a component of its capital base given the inherent characteristics of the securities. These characteristics include the long-dated nature (e.g., some have final
maturity at issuance of 30 years extendible at the Company’s option by a further 19 years, others have a 60-year final maturity at issuance), the Company’s ability to defer coupon interest for up to 20 consecutive quarters and the
subordinated nature of the obligations in the capital structure. The Company also receives rating agency equity credit for these securities.



The following table sets forth the Company’s total assets, adjusted assets and leverage ratios as of
November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005 and for the average month-end balances during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005:

(1)

The results for the Company and for the Institutional Securities segment for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006 were adjusted (see “Other Items—Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 108” herein).

(2)

Leverage ratio equals total assets divided by tangible shareholders’ equity.

(3)

Adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible shareholders’ equity.

Activity in Fiscal 2006.

The Company’s total capital consists of shareholders’ equity, long-term borrowings (debt obligations scheduled to mature in more than 12 months), junior
subordinated debt issued to capital trusts, and Capital Units. At November 30, 2006, total capital was $162,134 million, an increase of $36,243 million from November 30, 2005.

During the 12 months ended November 30, 2006, the Company issued senior notes aggregating $49.5 billion, including non-U.S. dollar
currency notes aggregating $21.3 billion and $1,989 million of junior subordinated debentures. In connection with the note issuances, the Company has entered into certain transactions to obtain floating interest rates based primarily on short-term
London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”) trading levels. At November 30, 2006, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Company’s Senior Indebtedness (as defined in the Company’s senior debt indentures) was
approximately $158 billion (including guaranteed obligations of the indebtedness of subsidiaries). The weighted average maturity of the Company’s long-term borrowings, based upon stated maturity dates, was approximately 5.5 years at
November 30, 2006. Subsequent to fiscal year-end and through January 31, 2007, the Company’s long-term borrowings (net of repayments) increased by approximately $11 billion.



Subsequent to fiscal year-end, the Company and Morgan Stanley Finance plc, a U.K. subsidiary, announced the
Company’s intention to redeem all of the outstanding Capital Units on February 28, 2007.

In July 2006, the Company issued 44,000,000 Depositary Shares, in an aggregate of $1,100 million, representing 1/1,000th of a Share of Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, $0.01 par
value (“Series A Preferred Stock”). The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Company’s option, in whole or in part, on or after July 15, 2011 at a redemption price of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per
Depositary Share). The Series A Preferred Stock also has a preference over the Company’s common stock upon liquidation.

Economic Capital.

The Company uses an economic capital model to determine the amount of equity capital needed to support the risk of its business activities and to ensure that the Company remains adequately capitalized. The Company
calculates economic capital on a going-concern basis, which is defined as the amount of capital needed to run the business through the business cycle and satisfy the requirements of regulators, rating agencies and the market. Business unit economic
capital allocations are evaluated by benchmarking to similarly rated peer firms by business segment. The Company believes this methodology provides an indication of the appropriate level of capital for each business segment as if each were an
independent operating entity.

Economic capital requirements are allocated to
each business segment and are sub-allocated to product lines as appropriate. This process is intended to align equity capital with the risks in each business, provide business managers with tools for measuring and managing risk, and allow senior
management to evaluate risk-adjusted returns (such as return on economic capital and shareholder value added) to facilitate resource allocation decisions.

The Company’s methodology is based on a going-concern approach that assigns common equity to each business unit based on regulatory capital usage plus additional
capital for stress losses, including principal investment risk. Regulatory capital, including additional capital assigned for goodwill and intangible assets, is a minimum requirement to ensure the Company’s access to funding and credibility in
the market. The Company believes it must be able to sustain stress losses and maintain capital substantially above regulatory minimums while supporting ongoing business activities. The difference between the Company’s consolidated book equity
and aggregate common equity requirements denotes the Company’s unallocated capital position, which is not currently reflected in business segment performance metrics.

The Company assesses stress loss capital across various dimensions of market, credit, business and operational risks. Stress losses are
defined at the 90% to 95% confidence interval in order to capture worst potential losses in 10 to 20 years. Stress loss calculations are tangible and transparent and avoid reliance on extreme loss statistical models.

Market risk scenarios capture systematic, idiosyncratic and random market risk through the
use of internal market stress data. Credit risk is included in the form of idiosyncratic counterparty default events. Business risk incorporates earnings volatility due to variability in revenue flows, with estimates on the mix of fixed versus
variable expenses at various points in the business cycle. Operational stress losses primarily reflect legal risk across the Company.

The Company may enhance the economic capital model and allocation methodology over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment to ensure that
the model continues to reflect the risks inherent in the Company’s business activities and to reflect changes in the drivers of the level and cost of required capital.



The following table presents the Company’s allocated average common equity (“economic capital”) during
fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005:

The increase in economic capital
allocated to Institutional Securities reflects the increased risk profile that has resulted from the Company’s decisions to invest in key businesses. The Company expects this growth to continue, provided market opportunities continue to
warrant such investments.

Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2007,
economic capital will be met by regulatory Tier 1 equity (including common shareholders’ equity, certain preferred stock, eligible hybrid capital instruments and deductions of goodwill and certain intangible
assets and deferred tax assets), subject to regulatory limits. The Tier 1 equity components will also be reflected in the average common equity allocated to the business segments. This enhancement to the Company’s equity capital model
and related disclosures will be made on a prospective basis.

The following
table presents the Company’s fiscal 2006 fourth quarter average common equity as calculated under the current methodology and under the new methodology commencing in the first quarter of fiscal 2007:

The $2.5 billion of incremental
unallocated capital under the pro forma new methodology is due to the inclusion of eligible hybrid capital instruments, which is partially offset by the inclusion of certain deferred tax assets. A portion of the unallocated capital existing as of
November 30, 2006 has been used for the acquisitions and investments that closed subsequent to fiscal year-end (see also “Other Items—Business and Other Acquisitions and Dispositions” herein). The Company currently anticipates that
unallocated capital will be used for organic growth, additional acquisitions and other capital needs, including repurchases of common stock.

During fiscal 2007, the Company’s shareholders’ equity will be affected by the adoption of SFAS No. 157 and SFAS No. 158 (see “Other Items —
Accounting Developments” herein).

Equity Capital Management
Policies.

The Company’s senior management views equity capital as an important source of financial strength and, therefore, pursues a strategy of ensuring that the Company’s equity capital base adequately
reflects and provides protection from the economic risks inherent in its businesses. Capital is required for, among other things, the Company’s inventories, underwritings, principal investments, consumer loans, bridge loans and other
financings, investments in fixed assets and for future uses. Capital for future uses will be included within unallocated capital until required by the business segments. The Company also considers return



on common equity to be an important measure of its performance, in the context of both the particular business environment in which the Company is operating
and its peer group’s results. In this regard, the Company actively manages its consolidated equity capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital
policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and, therefore, in the future may expand or contract its equity capital base to address the changing needs of its businesses. The Company attempts to maintain total equity, on a
consolidated basis, at least equal to the sum of its operating subsidiaries’ equity.

At November 30, 2006, the Company’s equity capital (which includes shareholders’ equity and junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts) was $40,248 million, an increase of $8,302 million from
November 30, 2005. The Company returns internally generated equity capital that is in excess of the needs of its businesses to its shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends. During fiscal 2006, the Company purchased
approximately $3.4 billion of its common stock (approximately 52 million shares) through open market purchases at an average cost of $65.43 (see also “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer
Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 5).

In December
2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $6 billion of the Company’s outstanding common stock. This share repurchase authorization replaces the Company’s previous repurchase
authorizations with one repurchase program for capital management purposes that will consider, among other things, business segment capital needs, as well as equity-based compensation and benefit plan requirements. The Company expects to exercise
the authorization over the next 12-18 months at prices the Company deems appropriate, subject to its surplus capital position, market conditions and regulatory considerations.

The Board of Directors determines the declaration and payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. In December 2006, the Company announced
that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend per common share of $0.27. The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $388.045 per share of Series A Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock
(represented by depositary shares, each representing 1/1,000th interest in a share of preferred stock and each having a dividend of $0.388045).

Liquidity Management Policies.

The primary goal of the Company’s liquidity and funding activities is to ensure adequate financing over a wide range of potential credit ratings and market
environments. Given the highly liquid nature of the Company’s balance sheet, day-to-day funding requirements are largely fulfilled through the use of stable collateralized financing. The Company has centralized management of credit-sensitive
unsecured funding sources in the Treasury Department. In order to meet target liquidity requirements and withstand an unforeseen contraction in credit availability, the Company has designed a liquidity management framework.



Liquidity Management

Framework:

Designed to:

Liquidity Reserve

Maintain, at all times, a liquidity reserve composed of immediately available cash and cash
equivalents and a pool of unencumbered securities that can be sold or pledged to provide same-day liquidity to the Company. The reserve is periodically assessed and determined based on day-to-day funding requirements and strategic liquidity targets.
The liquidity reserve averaged approximately $44 billion during fiscal 2006, of which approximately $36 billion on average was held at the parent company.

Contingency Funding Plan.

The Company’s Contingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) model
incorporates a wide range of potential cash outflows during a liquidity stress event, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within one year; (ii) maturity roll-off of outstanding letters
of credit with no further issuance and replacement with cash collateral; (iii) return of unsecured securities borrowed and any cash raised against these securities; (iv) additional collateral that would be required by counterparties in the
event of a ratings downgrade; (v) higher haircuts on or lower availability of secured funding; (vi) client cash withdrawals; (vii) drawdowns on unfunded commitments provided to third parties; and (viii) discretionary unsecured
debt buybacks.

The Company’s CFP is developed at the legal entity level
in order to capture specific cash requirements and availability for the parent company and each of its major operating subsidiaries. The CFP assumes that the parent company does not have access to cash that may be trapped at subsidiaries due to
regulatory, legal or tax constraints. In addition, the CFP assumes that the parent company does not draw down on its committed credit facilities.

Cash Capital.

The Company maintains a cash capital model that measures long-term funding sources against requirements. Sources of cash capital include the parent company’s equity and the non-current portion of certain
long-term borrowings. Uses of cash capital include the following: (i) illiquid assets such as buildings, equipment, goodwill, net intangible assets, exchange memberships, deferred tax assets and principal investments; (ii) a portion of
securities inventory that is not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a credit-stressed environment (i.e., stressed haircuts); and (iii) expected drawdowns on unfunded commitments.

The Company seeks to maintain a surplus cash capital position. The Company’s equity
capital of $40,248 million (including junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts), long-term borrowings (debt obligations scheduled to mature in more than 12 months) of $121,820 million and Capital Units of $66 million comprised the
Company’s total capital of $162,134 million as of November 30, 2006, which substantially exceeded cash capital requirements.

Liquidity Reserve.

The Company seeks to maintain a target liquidity reserve that is sized to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets, including coverage of a significant portion of expected cash outflows over a
short-term horizon in a potential liquidity crisis. This liquidity reserve is held in the form of cash deposits with banks and a pool of unencumbered securities. The Company manages the pool of unencumbered securities, against which funding can be
raised, on a global basis, and securities for the pool are chosen accordingly. The U.S. and non-U.S. components, held in the form of a reverse repurchase agreement at the parent company, consists of U.S. and European government bonds and other
high-quality collateral and at November 30, 2006 were approximately $41 billion and averaged approximately $26 billion for the year ended November 30, 2006. The parent company cash component of the liquidity reserve at November 30,
2006 was approximately $7 billion and averaged approximately $10 billion for the year ended November 30, 2006. The Company believes that diversifying the form in which its liquidity reserve (cash and securities) is maintained enhances its
ability to quickly and



efficiently source funding in a stressed environment. The Company’s funding requirements and target liquidity reserve may vary based on changes in the
level and composition of its balance sheet, timing of specific transactions, client financing activity, market conditions and seasonal factors.

Committed Credit Facilities.

The maintenance of committed credit facilities serves to further diversify the Company’s funding sources. The Company values committed credit as a secondary
component of its liquidity management framework. The committed credit facilities include a diversification of lenders to the Company covering geographic regions, including North America, Europe and Asia.

The Company maintains a senior revolving credit agreement with a group of banks to support
general liquidity needs, including the issuance of commercial paper, which consists of three separate tranches: a U.S. dollar tranche with the Company as borrower; a Japanese yen tranche with Morgan Stanley Japan Securities Co., Ltd.
(“MSJS”) as borrower and the Company as borrower and guarantor for MSJS borrowings; and a multicurrency tranche available in both euro and sterling with the Company as borrower. Under this combined facility (the “Credit
Facility”), the banks are committed to provide up to $7.5 billion under the U.S. dollar tranche, 80 billion Japanese yen under the Japanese yen tranche and $3.25 billion under the multicurrency tranche. At November 30, 2006, the Company
had a $16.4 billion consolidated stockholders’ equity surplus as compared with the Credit Facility’s covenant requirement.

The Company anticipates that it may utilize the Credit Facility for short-term funding from time to time (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). The
Company does not believe that any of the covenant requirements in its Credit Facility will impair its ability to obtain funding under the Credit Facility, pay its current level of dividends or obtain loan arrangements, letters of credit and other
financial guarantees or other financial accommodations. At November 30, 2006, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Facility.

The Company and its subsidiaries also maintain certain committed bilateral credit facilities to support general liquidity needs. These facilities are expected to be drawn
from time to time to cover short-term funding needs.

On a yearly basis, the
Company’s committed credit strategy is reviewed and approved by its senior management. This strategy takes the Company’s total liquidity sources into consideration when determining the appropriate size and mix of committed credit.

The Company, through several of its subsidiaries, maintains several funded
committed credit facilities to support various businesses, including (without limitation), the collateralized commercial and residential mortgage whole loan, derivative contracts, warehouse lending, emerging market loan, structured product,
corporate loan, investment banking and prime brokerage businesses.

Capital
Covenant.

In October 2006, the Company executed a replacement capital
covenant in connection with the offering by Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VII (the “Trust”) of $1,100,000,000 aggregate liquidation amount of its 6.60% Trust Preferred Securities (the “Capital Securities”). Under the terms of the
replacement capital covenant, the Company has agreed, for the benefit of the holders of covered debt, as described below, that it will not, and will cause the Trust and its subsidiaries not to, redeem or repurchase any of the Capital Securities (or
the debentures that the Company issued to the Trust that underlie the Capital Securities) on or after January 15, 2046 and prior to October 15, 2066, unless (i) the Company has obtained any then required regulatory approval and
(ii) during a specified 180-day period the Company has received net proceeds from the sale of specified replacement capital securities. The initial class of covered debtholders are the holders of the junior subordinated debentures underlying
the capital securities of Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VI and the holders of such capital securities. For a complete description of the replacement capital securities and the other terms of the replacement capital covenant, see the Company’s
Current Report on Form 8-K dated October 12, 2006.



Funding Management Policies.

The Company funds its balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources include the Company’s equity capital;
long-term debt; repurchase agreements; U.S., Canadian, Euro, Japanese and Australian commercial paper; asset-backed securitizations; letters of credit; unsecured bond borrowings; securities lending; buy/sell agreements; municipal reinvestments;
promissory notes; master notes; and committed and uncommitted lines of credit. Repurchase agreement transactions, securities lending and a portion of the Company’s bank borrowings are made on a collateralized basis and, therefore, provide a
more stable source of funding than short-term unsecured borrowings. The Company has active financing programs for both standard and structured products in the U.S., European and Asian markets, targeting global investors and currencies such as the
U.S. dollar, euro, British pound, Australian dollar and Japanese yen.

The
Company’s bank subsidiaries solicit deposits from consumers, purchase Federal Funds, issue short-term institutional certificates of deposits and issue bank notes. Interest bearing deposits are classified by type as savings, brokered and other
time deposits. Savings deposits consist primarily of money market deposit accounts sold nationally and savings deposits obtained from individual securities clients. Brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit issued by the
Company’s bank subsidiaries. Other time deposits include individual and institutional certificates of deposit.

The Company’s funding management policies are designed to provide for financings that are executed in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to the
Company’s operations that would result from an interruption in the availability of the Company’s funding sources. The Company pursues a strategy of diversification of funding sources (by product, by investor and by region) and attempts to
ensure that the tenor of the Company’s liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. Maturities of financings are designed to manage exposure to refinancing risk in any one period. The Company maintains
a surplus of unused short- term funding sources at all times to withstand any unforeseen contraction in credit capacity. In addition, the Company attempts to maintain cash and unhypothecated marketable securities equal to at least 110% of its
outstanding short-term unsecured borrowings. The Company also maintains committed credit facilities (described above) to support its ongoing borrowing programs.

Secured Financing.

A substantial portion of the Company’s total assets consists of highly liquid marketable securities and
short-term receivables arising principally from its Institutional Securities sales and trading activities. The highly liquid nature of these assets provides the Company with flexibility in financing these assets with stable collateralized
borrowings, while the securitization market allows for the securitization of the credit card receivables arising from the Company’s Discover business.

The Company’s goal is to maximize funding through less credit sensitive collateralized borrowings and asset securitizations in order to reduce reliance on unsecured
financing. The Institutional Securities business emphasizes the use of collateralized short-term borrowings to limit the growth of short-term unsecured funding, which is more typically subject to disruption during periods of financial stress. As
part of this effort, the Institutional Securities business continually seeks to expand its global secured borrowing capacity. Similarly, Discover, through its use of the securitization market, reduces the need for other unsecured parent company
financing.

Unsecured Financing.

The
Company views long-term debt as a stable source of funding for core inventories, consumer loans and illiquid assets. In general, securities inventories not financed by secured funding sources and the majority of current assets are financed with a
combination of short-term funding, floating rate long-term debt or fixed rate long-term debt swapped to a floating rate. Fixed assets are financed with fixed rate long-term debt. Both fixed rate and floating rate long-term debt (in addition to
sources of funds accessed directly by the Company’s Discover business) are used to finance the Company’s consumer loan portfolio. Consumer loan financing is targeted to match the repricing and duration characteristics of the loans
financed. The Company uses



derivative products (primarily interest rate, currency and equity swaps) to assist in asset and liability management, reduce borrowing costs and hedge
interest rate risk (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).

The
Company issues long-term debt in excess of the amount necessary to meet the needs of its securities inventory and less liquid assets as determined by its Cash Capital Policy. In addition to these needs, long-term debt funding is employed to enhance
the Company’s liquidity position by reducing reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments (e.g., commercial paper and other unsecured short-term borrowings). Availability and cost of financing to the Company can vary depending on market
conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, the Company’s credit ratings and the overall availability of credit.

The Company has a portfolio approach for managing the unsecured debt issued by the parent company. This approach gives the Company flexibility to manage the unsecured
debt portfolio across maturities, currencies, investors and regions, taking into account market capacity and pricing. Down-lending to subsidiaries is managed to ensure that intercompany borrowings mature before those of the parent company. Liquidity
and funding policies recognize potential constraints on the Company’s ability to transfer funds between regulated entities and the parent company.

During fiscal 2006, the Company’s long-term financing strategy was driven, in part, by its continued focus on improving its balance sheet strength (evaluated through
enhanced capital and liquidity positions), a significant factor in the maintenance of strong credit ratings. As a result, for fiscal 2006, $39 billion of unsecured debt was issued (excluding certain equity-linked and credit-linked products not
considered to be a component of the Company’s cash capital). Financing transactions were structured to ensure staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and a diversified investor base was targeted through sales to domestic as
well as international institutional and retail clients. Unsecured debt issuance activity resulted in a net increase in the long-term debt component of the cash capital portfolio of approximately $24 billion. During fiscal 2006, the Company also
issued an aggregate of $3.1 billion of hybrid and equity capital securities in furtherance of its capital management objectives. This included $1.1 billion of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and $1.1 billion of enhanced trust preferred
securities.

Credit Ratings.

The Company’s reliance on external sources to finance a significant portion of its
day-to-day operations makes access to global sources of financing important. The cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are dependent on the Company’s short-term and long-term credit ratings. Factors that are significant to the
determination of the Company’s credit ratings or that otherwise affect its ability to raise short-term and long-term financing include the Company’s level and volatility of earnings, relative positions in the markets in which it operates,
geographic and product diversification, retention of key personnel, risk profile, risk management policies, cash liquidity, capital structure, corporate lending credit risk, and legal and regulatory developments. In addition, continuing
consolidation in the credit card industry presents Discover with stronger competitors that may challenge future growth. A deterioration in any of the previously mentioned factors or combination of these factors may lead rating agencies to downgrade
the credit ratings of the Company, thereby increasing the cost to the Company in obtaining unsecured funding. In addition, the Company’s debt ratings can have a significant impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses
where longer term counterparty performance is critical, such as OTC derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps.

In connection with certain OTC trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with the Institutional Securities business, the Company would be required to
provide additional collateral to certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade by either Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s. At November 30, 2006, the amount of additional collateral that would be required in
the event of a one-notch downgrade of the Company’s senior debt credit rating was approximately $1,184 million. Of this amount, $561 million relates to bilateral



arrangements between the Company and other parties where upon the downgrade of one party, the downgraded party must deliver incremental collateral to the
other. These bilateral downgrade arrangements are a risk management tool used extensively by the Company as credit exposures are reduced if counterparties are downgraded.

As of January 31, 2007, the Company’s credit ratings were as follows:

(1)

On December 19, 2006, Fitch Ratings changed the outlook on the Company’s senior debt ratings from Stable to Negative.

(2)

On October 27, 2006, Standard & Poor’s changed the outlook on the Company’s senior debt ratings from Stable to Positive.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.

The Company enters into various arrangements with unconsolidated entities, including
variable interest entities, primarily in connection with its Institutional Securities and Discover businesses.

Institutional Securities Activities

.

The Company utilizes SPEs primarily in connection with securitization activities. The Company engages in securitization activities
related to commercial and residential mortgage loans, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate bonds and loans, municipal bonds and other types of financial assets. The Company may retain interests in the securitized financial
assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. These retained interests are included in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value. Any changes in the fair value of such retained interests are recognized in the
consolidated statements of income. Retained interests in securitized financial assets associated with the Company’s Institutional Securities business were approximately $4.8 billion at November 30, 2006, the majority of which were related
to residential mortgage loan, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligation and commercial mortgage loan securitization transactions. For further information about the Company’s Institutional Securities securitization activities, see Notes 2
and 4 to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for information about variable interest entities and the Company’s arrangements with these entities.

The Company has entered into liquidity facilities with SPEs and other counterparties, whereby
the Company is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. The Company often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the SPEs in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities (see Note 20 to the
consolidated financial statements).

Discover
Activities.

The asset securitization market is an important source of funding for the Company’s Discover business. By utilizing this market, the Company further diversifies its funding sources, realizes
cost-effective funding and reduces reliance on the Company’s other funding sources, including unsecured debt. The securitization transaction structures utilized for the Discover business are accounted for as sales; i.e., off-balance sheet
transactions in accordance with U.S. GAAP (see Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements). In connection with its credit card securitization program, the Company transfers credit card receivables, on a revolving basis, to a trust, which
issues asset-backed securities that are registered with the SEC, are used to support the issuance of publicly listed notes or are privately placed. This structure includes certain features designed to protect the investors that could result in
earlier-than-expected amortization of the transactions,



potentially resulting in the need for the Company to obtain alternative funding arrangements. The primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of
cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements (“economic early amortization”).

Economic early amortization risk reflects the possibility of negative net securitization cash flows (which would occur if the coupon, contractual servicing fee and net
charge-offs exceeded the collections of finance charges and cardmember fees on securitized credit card receivables) and is driven primarily by the trust’s credit card receivables performance (in particular, receivables yield, cardmember fees
and credit losses incurred) as well as the contractual rate of return of the asset-backed securities. In the event of an economic early amortization, receivables that otherwise would have been subsequently purchased by the trust from the Company
would instead continue to be recognized on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition since the cash flows generated in the trust would instead be used to repay investors in the asset-backed securities. Recognizing these
receivables would require the Company to obtain alternative funding.

Guarantees.

FASB Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”) requires the
Company to disclose information about its obligations under certain guarantee arrangements. FIN 45 defines guarantees as contracts and indemnification agreements that contingently require a guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on
changes in an underlying measure (such as an interest or foreign exchange rate, a security or commodity price, an index, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of a specified event) related to an asset, liability or equity security of a guaranteed
party. FIN 45 also defines guarantees as contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entity’s failure to perform under an agreement as well as indirect guarantees of the
indebtedness of others.

The table below summarizes certain information
regarding derivative contracts, financial guarantees to third parties, market value guarantees and liquidity facilities at November 30, 2006:

See Note 20 to the consolidated
financial statements for information on indemnities, exchange/clearinghouse member guarantees, general partner guarantees, securitized asset guarantees, merchant chargeback guarantees and other guarantees.



Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments.

In connection with its operating activities, the Company enters into certain contractual
obligations, as well as commitments to fund certain fixed assets and other less liquid investments.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at November 30, 2006 include long-term borrowings,
operating leases and purchase obligations. The Company’s future cash payments associated with its contractual obligations as of November 30, 2006 are summarized below:

(1)

See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

(2)

See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.

(3)

Purchase obligations for goods and services include payments for, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, advertising, sponsorship, and computer and telecommunications
maintenance agreements. Purchase obligations at November 30, 2006 reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. These amounts exclude obligations for
goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Purchase obligations also include amounts related to the acquisitions of Saxon, FrontPoint and CityMortgage (see “Other Items
— Business and Other Acquisitions and Dispositions” herein).

The Company’s commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit, other financial guarantees, investment activities, and corporate lending and financing commitments as of November 30, 2006 are summarized below by period of
expiration. Since commitments associated with letters of credit, other financial guarantees, and lending and financing arrangements may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements:

(1)

This amount represents the Company’s outstanding letters of credit and other financial guarantees, which are primarily used to satisfy various collateral requirements. This
amount also includes commercial loan commitments to small businesses.

(2)

The Company’s investment grade and non-investment grade primary and secondary lending commitments are made in connection with corporate lending and other business activities.
Credit ratings for primary commitments are determined by the Company’s Institutional Credit Department using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies. Credit ratings of BB+ or lower are considered
non-investment grade.



(3)

This amount represents lending commitments extended by the Company to companies that are secured by assets of the borrower. Loans made under these arrangements typically are at
variable rates and generally provide for over-collateralization based upon the creditworthiness of the borrower.

(4)

This amount represents the Company’s forward purchase contracts involving mortgage loans.

(5)

See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.

The table above does not include commitments to extend credit for consumer loans of approximately $274 billion. Such commitments arise primarily from agreements with
customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. These commitments, substantially all of which the Company can terminate at any time and which do not
necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage and customer creditworthiness. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company guarantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations
(including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. These guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading
counterparties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

At November 30, 2006, the Company had commitments to enter into reverse repurchase and
repurchase agreements of approximately $104 billion and $76 billion, respectively.

Principal Investments.

Principal investing activities are
capital investments in companies, generally for proprietary purposes, to maximize total returns to the Company. The Company has committed to increasing its principal investing activity. At November 30, 2006, the Company had aggregate
principal investments with a carrying value of approximately $1.8 billion, which are included within Other assets in the consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company intends to make additional investments over time to bring the level
of principal investments to approximately $2.5 billion.

Regulatory
Requirements.

Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated
(“MS&Co.”) and Morgan Stanley DW Inc. (“MSDWI”) are registered broker-dealers and registered futures commission merchants and, accordingly, are subject to the minimum net capital requirements of the SEC, the NYSE and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited (“MSIL”), a London-based broker-dealer subsidiary, is subject to the capital requirements of the Financial Services Authority, and MSJS, a Tokyo-based
broker-dealer subsidiary, is subject to the capital requirements of the Financial Services Agency. MS&Co., MSDWI, MSIL and MSJS have consistently operated in excess of their respective regulatory capital requirements (see Note 13 to the
consolidated financial statements).

In fiscal 2007, the Company intends to
merge MSDWI into MS&Co. Upon completion of the merger, the surviving entity, MS&Co., will be the Company’s principal U.S. broker-dealer.

Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) and other bank regulatory agencies, FDIC-insured
financial institutions must maintain (a) 3% to 5% of Tier 1 capital, as defined, to average assets (“leverage ratio”), (b) 4% of Tier 1 capital, as defined, to risk-weighted assets (“Tier 1 risk-weighted capital ratio”)
and (c) 8% of total capital, as defined, to risk-weighted assets (“total risk-weighted capital ratio”). At November 30, 2006, the leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk-weighted capital ratio and total risk-weighted capital ratio of each of
the Company’s FDIC-insured financial institutions exceeded these regulatory minimums.



Certain other U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries are subject to various securities, commodities and banking regulations and
capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate. These subsidiaries have consistently operated in excess of their local capital adequacy requirements. Morgan Stanley
Derivative Products Inc., the Company’s triple-A rated derivative products subsidiary, maintains certain operating restrictions that have been reviewed by various rating agencies.

Effective December 1, 2005, the Company became a consolidated supervised entity (“CSE”) as defined by the SEC. As such, the
Company is subject to group-wide supervision and examination by the SEC and to minimum capital requirements on a consolidated basis. As of November 30, 2006, the Company was in compliance with the CSE capital requirements.

MS&Co. is required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $1 billion and net capital
in excess of $500 million in accordance with the market and credit risk standards of Appendix E of Rule 15c3-1. MS&Co. is also required to notify the SEC in the event that its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. As of
November 30, 2006, MS&Co. had tentative net capital in excess of the minimum and the notification requirements.

Effects of Inflation and Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.

The Company’s assets to a large extent are liquid in nature and, therefore, are not significantly affected by inflation, although inflation may result in increases
in the Company’s expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets, upon the value of financial
instruments and upon the markets for consumer credit services, it may adversely affect the Company’s financial position and profitability.

A significant portion of the Company’s business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S.
dollar can therefore affect the value of non-U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored, and, where cost-justified, strategies are adopted that are
designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on the Company’s financial performance. These strategies may include the financing of non-U.S. dollar assets with direct or swap-based borrowings in the same currency and the use of currency
forward contracts or the spot market in various hedging transactions related to net assets, revenues, expenses or cash flows.



Item 7A.    Quantitative

and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Risk Management.

Risk Management Policy and Control Structure.

Risk is an inherent part of the Company’s business and activities. The Company’s ability to properly and effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in its activities is critical to
its soundness and profitability. The Company’s broad-based portfolio of business activities helps reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its net revenues as a whole. The Company seeks to identify,
assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in the Company’s business activities: market, credit, operational, legal, and liquidity and funding risk. Liquidity and
funding risk is discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7. The Company’s currency exposure relating to its
net monetary investments in non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries is discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

The cornerstone of the Company’s risk management philosophy is protection of the Company’s franchise, reputation and financial standing. The Company’s risk
management philosophy is based on the following principles: comprehensiveness, independence, accountability, defined risk tolerance and transparency. Given the importance of effective risk management to the Company’s reputation, senior
management requires thorough and frequent communication and appropriate escalation of risk matters.

Risk management at the Company requires independent Company-level oversight, accountability of the Company’s business segments, constant communication, judgment, and knowledge of specialized products and markets.
The Company’s senior management takes an active role in the identification, assessment and management of various risks at both the Company and business segment level. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the global
financial services business, the Company’s risk management philosophy, with its attendant policies, procedures and methodologies, is evolutionary in nature and subject to ongoing review and modification.

The nature of the Company’s risks, coupled with this risk management philosophy, informs
the Company’s risk governance structure. The Company’s risk governance structure includes the Firm Risk Committee and the Capital Structure and Strategic Transactions Committee, the Chief Risk Officer, the Internal Audit Department,
independent control groups, and various risk control managers, committees and groups located within the business segments.

The Firm Risk Committee, composed of the Company’s most senior officers, oversees the Company’s risk management structure. The Firm Risk Committee’s
responsibilities include oversight of the Company’s risk management principles, procedures and limits, and the monitoring of material financial, operational and franchise risks. The Firm Risk Committee is overseen by the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors (the “Audit Committee”). The Capital Structure and Strategic Transactions Committee (the “Capital Committee”) reviews strategic transactions for the Company and significant changes to the Company’s capital
structure. The Capital Committee’s responsibilities include reviewing measures of capital and evaluating capital resources relative to the Company’s risk profile and strategy.

The Chief Risk Officer, a member of the Firm Risk Committee, oversees compliance with Company risk limits; approves certain excessions of
Company risk limits; reviews material market and credit risks; and reviews results of risk management processes with the Audit Committee.

The Internal Audit Department provides independent risk and control assessment and reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the Chief Legal Officer. The
Internal Audit Department periodically examines the Company’s operational and control environment and conducts audits designed to cover all major risk categories.



The Market Risk, Credit Risk, Operational Risk, Financial Control, Treasury, and Legal and Compliance Departments
(collectively, the “Company Control Groups”), which are all independent of the Company’s business units, assist senior management and the Firm Risk Committee in monitoring and controlling the Company’s risk through a number of
control processes. The Company is committed to employing qualified personnel with appropriate expertise in each of its various administrative and business areas to implement effectively the Company’s risk management and monitoring systems and
processes.

Each business segment has a risk committee that is responsible for
ensuring that the business segment, as applicable, adheres to established limits for market, credit, operational and other risks; implements risk measurement, monitoring, and management policies and procedures that are consistent with the risk
framework established by the Firm Risk Committee; and reviews, on a periodic basis, its aggregate risk exposures, risk exception experience, and the efficacy of its risk identification, measurement, monitoring and management policies and procedures,
and related controls.

Each of the Company’s business segments also has
designated operations officers, committees and groups, including operations and information technology groups (collectively, “Segment Control Groups” and, together with the Company Control Groups, the “Control Groups”) to manage
and monitor specific risks and report to the business segment risk committee. The Control Groups work together to review the risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to, among other things, the business segment’s
market and credit risk profile, sales practices, pricing of consumer loans and reserve adequacy, reputation, legal enforceability, and operational and technological risks. Participation by the senior officers of the Control Groups helps ensure that
risk policies and procedures, exceptions to risk limits, new products and business ventures, and transactions with risk elements undergo a thorough review.

The following is a discussion of the Company’s risk management policies and procedures for its principal risks (other than liquidity and funding risk). The
discussion focuses on the Company’s securities activities (primarily its institutional trading activities) and consumer lending and related activities. The Company believes that these activities generate a substantial portion of its principal
risks. This discussion and the estimated amounts of the Company’s market risk exposure generated by the Company’s statistical analyses are forward-looking statements. However, the analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of
future events, and actual results may vary significantly from such analyses due to events in the markets in which the Company operates and certain other factors described below.

Market Risk.

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities (the price volatility of the underlying
instrument imputed from option prices), correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, the Company incurs market risk as a result of trading and client facilitation activities,
principally within the Institutional Securities business where the substantial majority of the Company’s Value-at-Risk (“VaR”) for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, the Company incurs trading-related market risk within
the Global Wealth Management Group. Asset Management incurs non-trading market risk primarily from capital investments in funds and investments in private equity vehicles. In its consumer lending activities, Discover is also exposed to non-trading
market risk primarily through changes in interest rates.

Sound market risk
management is an integral part of the Company’s culture. The various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. The Control Groups help ensure that these risks are
measured and closely monitored and are made transparent to senior management. The Market Risk Department is responsible for ensuring transparency of material market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating risk
concentrations to appropriate senior management. To execute these responsibilities, the Market Risk Department monitors the Company’s risk against limits on aggregate risk exposures, performs a variety of risk analyses, routinely reports risk
summaries



and maintains the Company’s VaR system. A variety of limits are designed to control price and liquidity risk. Market risk is monitored through various
measures: statistically (using VaR and related analytical measures); by measures of position sensitivity; and through routine stress testing and scenario analyses conducted by the Market Risk Department in collaboration with the business units. The
material risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the Market Risk Department that are circulated to, and discussed with, senior management.

Sales and Trading and Related Activities.

Primary Market Risk Exposures and Market Risk Management.

During fiscal 2006, the Company had
exposures to a wide range of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices—and the associated implied volatilities and spreads—related to the global markets in which it conducts its trading activities. The
Company is exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a result of its market-making activities and proprietary trading in interest rate sensitive financial instruments (e.g., risk arising from changes in the level or implied volatility of
interest rates, the timing of mortgage prepayments, the shape of the yield curve and credit spreads). Among the markets in which the Company is active and from which activities those exposures arise are the following: emerging market corporate and
government debt, non-investment grade and distressed corporate debt, investment grade corporate debt, and asset-backed debt. Moreover, some of these markets, such as non-investment grade corporate debt, have experienced periods of illiquidity in the
past, and may do so in the future. The Company is exposed to equity price and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in equity securities and derivatives and maintaining proprietary positions (including positions in non-public
entities). The Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in foreign currencies and foreign currency options and from maintaining foreign exchange positions. The Company is exposed to
commodity price and implied volatility risk as a result of market-making activities and maintaining positions in physical commodities (such as crude and refined oil products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals) and related
derivatives.

The Company manages its trading positions by employing a variety
of risk mitigation strategies. These strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments, including a variety of derivative
products (e.g., futures, forwards, swaps and options). The Company manages the market risk associated with its trading activities on a Company-wide basis, on a worldwide trading division level and on an individual product basis. The Company manages
and monitors its market risk exposures in such a way as to maintain a portfolio that the Company believes is well-diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflects the Company’s aggregate risk tolerance as
established by the Company’s senior management.

Aggregate market risk
limits have been approved for the Company and for its major trading divisions worldwide (equity and fixed income, which includes interest rate products, credit products, foreign exchange and commodities). Additional market risk limits are assigned
to trading desks and, as appropriate, products and regions. Trading division risk managers, desk risk managers, traders and the Market Risk Department monitor market risk measures against limits in accordance with policies set by senior management.

The Market Risk Department independently reviews the Company’s trading
portfolios on a regular basis from a market risk perspective utilizing VaR and other quantitative and qualitative risk measures and analyses. The Company’s trading businesses and the Market Risk Department also use, as appropriate, measures
such as sensitivity to changes in interest rates, prices, implied volatilities and time decay to monitor and report market risk exposures. Stress testing, which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified changes in market
factors for certain products, is performed periodically and is reviewed by trading division risk managers, desk risk managers and the Market Risk Department. The Market Risk Department also conducts scenario analyses, which estimate the
Company’s revenue sensitivity to a set of specific, predefined market and geopolitical events.

Value-at-Risk (VaR)

.

The Company uses the statistical technique known as VaR as one of the tools used to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of its trading
portfolios. The Market Risk Department calculates and distributes daily VaR-based risk measures to various levels of management.



VaR Methodology, Assumptions and Limitations

.

The Company estimates VaR using
a model based on historical simulation for major market risk factors and Monte Carlo simulation for name-specific risk in certain equity and fixed income exposures. Historical simulation involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily
changes in the value of trading portfolios based on two sets of inputs: historical observation of daily changes in key market indices or other market factors (“market risk factors”); and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio
values to these market risk factor changes. The Company’s VaR model uses approximately four years of historical data to characterize potential changes in market risk factors. The Company’s 95%/one-day VaR corresponds to the unrealized loss
in portfolio value that, based on historically observed market risk factor movements, would have been exceeded with a frequency of 5%, or five times in every 100 trading days, if the portfolio were held constant for one day.

The Company’s VaR model generally takes into account linear and non-linear exposures to
price risk and interest rate risk, and linear exposures to implied volatility risks. Market risks that are incorporated in the VaR model include equity and commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates and associated implied volatilities.
As a supplement to the use of historical simulation for major market risk factors, the Company’s VaR model uses Monte Carlo simulation to capture name-specific risk in equities and credit products (i.e., corporate bonds and credit derivatives).

The Company’s VaR models evolve over time in response to changes in the
composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities. As part of regular process improvement, additional systematic and name-specific risk factors may be added to improve the VaR model’s ability
to more accurately estimate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors.

Among their benefits, VaR models permit estimation of a portfolio’s aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating a range of varied market risks; reflect risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activities; and can
cover a wide range of portfolio assets. However, VaR risk measures should be interpreted carefully in light of the methodology’s limitations, which include the following: past changes in market risk factors may not always yield accurate
predictions of the distributions and correlations of future market movements; changes in portfolio value in response to market movements (especially for complex derivative portfolios) may differ from the responses calculated by a VaR model; VaR
using a one-day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day; the historical market risk factor data used for VaR estimation may provide only limited insight into losses that
could be incurred under market conditions that are unusual relative to the historical period used in estimating the VaR; and published VaR results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions. The Company is aware of
these and other limitations and, therefore, uses VaR as only one component in its risk management oversight process. As explained above, this process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses and extensive risk monitoring, analysis, and
control at the trading desk, division and Company levels.

VaR for Fiscal

.

The table below presents the Company’s Aggregate (Trading and Non-trading), Trading and Non-trading VaR for each of the Company’s primary market risk exposures at November 30, 2006 and
November 30, 2005, incorporating substantially all financial instruments generating market risk that are managed by the Company’s trading businesses. This measure of VaR incorporates most of the Company’s trading-related market risks.
However, a small proportion of trading positions generating market risk is not included in VaR, and the modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions relies upon approximations that, under certain circumstances, could produce significantly
different VaR results from those produced using more precise measures. For example, risks associated with residential mortgage-backed securities have been approximated as it is difficult to capture precisely these risks within a VaR context.

Aggregate Trading and Non-trading VaR also incorporates (a) the funding
liabilities related to institutional trading positions and (b) public company equity positions recorded as investments by the Company. Investments made by the Company that are not publicly traded are not reflected in the VaR results reported
below. Aggregate



Trading and Non-trading VaR also excludes certain funding liabilities primarily related to fixed and other non-trading assets. As of November 30, 2006,
the notional amount of funding liabilities related to non-trading assets (including office facilities and other equipment, goodwill, deferred tax assets, and intangible assets) was approximately $7.9 billion, with a duration of approximately 7.3
years.

Since the VaR statistics reported below are estimates based on
historical position and market data, VaR should not be viewed as predictive of the Company’s future revenues or financial performance or of its ability to monitor and manage risk. There can be no assurance that the Company’s actual losses
on a particular day will not exceed the VaR amounts indicated below or that such losses will not occur more than five times in 100 trading days.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company changed the confidence level at which VaR is reported for limit and other management purposes from a 99% confidence level
to a 95% confidence level. The Company believes that for risk management purposes, the 95% VaR statistic is a more useful estimator of possible trading losses resulting from adverse daily market moves. The Company also believes this change will
facilitate comparisons with other companies in the financial services industry. The table below presents 95%/one-day VaR for each of the Company’s primary risk exposures and on an aggregate basis at November 30, 2006 and November 30,
2005.

(1)

Diversification benefit equals the difference between Total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This benefit arises because the simulated one-day losses for
each of the four primary market risk categories occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each category.

The Company’s Aggregate VaR and Trading VaR at November 30, 2006 were $89 million and $85 million, respectively, compared with $61
million and $56 million, respectively, at November 30, 2005. The increase in Aggregate VaR and Trading VaR at year-end was driven primarily by increased directional exposure to equity products. Non-trading VaR at November 30, 2006
decreased to $15 million from $23 million at November 30, 2005, primarily due to a decrease in Non-trading interest rate and credit spread VaR. The overall increase reflects the Company’s strategy to grow key businesses, such as its
principal investing activities, and to take advantage of the opportunities presented by market conditions. The Company expects to continue to invest in its businesses and to increase its risk profile, provided market opportunities continue to
warrant such growth.

The Company views average Trading VaR over the fiscal
year as more representative of trends in the business than VaR at any single point in time. Table 2 below, which presents the high, low and average 95%/one-day Trading VaR during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, represents substantially all of the
Company’s trading activities. Certain market risks included in the year-end Aggregate VaR discussed above are excluded from these measures (e.g., equity price risk in public company equity positions recorded as principal investments by the
Company and certain funding liabilities related to trading positions).



Average Trading VaR for fiscal 2006 increased to $60 million from $57 million in fiscal 2005, reflecting increases in
equity price VaR and commodity price VaR. The increase in equity price VaR was predominantly driven by increased directional exposure to equity products. The increase in commodity price VaR was predominantly driven by increased exposures to energy
products (i.e., natural gas and electricity) and oil products (i.e., crude and distillates).

VaR Statistics Under Varying
Assumptions.

VaR statistics are not readily comparable across firms
because of differences in the breadth of products included in each firm’s VaR model, in the statistical assumptions made when simulating changes in market factors, and in the methods used to approximate portfolio revaluations under the
simulated market conditions. These differences can result in materially different VaR estimates for similar portfolios. As a result, VaR statistics are more reliable and relevant when used as indicators of trends in risk taking within a firm rather
than as a basis for inferring differences in risk taking across firms. Table 3 below presents the VaR statistics that would result if the Company were to adopt alternative parameters for its calculations, such as the reported confidence level (95%
versus 99%) for the VaR statistic or a shorter historical time series (four years versus one year) for market data upon which it bases its simulations:

In addition, if the Company were to
report Trading VaR (using a four-year historical time series) with respect to a 10-day holding period, the Company’s 95% and 99% Average Trading VaR for fiscal 2006 would have been $188 million and $291 million, respectively.



Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues for Fiscal 2006.

As shown in Table 2 above, the Company’s average 95%/one-day Trading VaR for fiscal
2006 was $60 million. The histogram below presents the distribution of the Company’s daily 95%/one-day Trading VaR for fiscal 2006. The most frequently occurring value was between $57 million and $60 million, while for approximately 93% of
trading days during the fiscal year, VaR ranged between $51 million and $69 million.

One method of evaluating the reasonableness of the
Company’s VaR model as a measure of the Company’s potential volatility of net revenue is to compare the VaR with actual trading revenue. Assuming no intra-day trading, for a 95%/one-day VaR, the expected number of times that trading losses
should exceed VaR during the fiscal year is 13, and, in general, if trading losses were to exceed VaR more than 21 times in a year, the accuracy of the VaR model could be questioned. Accordingly, the Company evaluates the reasonableness of its VaR
model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with actual trading results. The histogram below shows the distribution of daily net revenue during fiscal 2006 for the Company’s trading businesses (including
net interest and commissions but excluding primary and prime brokerage revenue credited to the trading businesses).



The Company observed a net trading loss of $87
million on one business day during fiscal 2006, which exceeded the 95%/one-day VaR for that day.

Consumer Lending and Related Activities.

Interest Rate Risk and Management

.

In its consumer lending activities, the Company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates. Such changes in interest rates impact
interest earning assets, principally credit card and other consumer loans and net excess servicing fees received in connection with consumer loans sold through asset securitizations, as well as the interest sensitive liabilities that finance these
assets, including asset-backed securitizations, long-term borrowings and deposits.

The Company’s interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing
schedules of consumer loans as well as the Company’s right, with notice to cardmembers, to reprice certain fixed rate consumer loans to a new interest rate in the future. To the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics
of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively, the Company may utilize interest rate derivative contracts, such as swap agreements, to achieve its objectives. Interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or
financing from fixed to variable repricing or from variable to fixed repricing.

Sensitivity Analysis Methodology, Assumptions and Limitations

.

For its consumer lending activities, the Company uses a variety of techniques to assess its interest rate risk exposure, one of which
is interest rate sensitivity simulation. For purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical, adverse change in interest rates over the 12-month period from its fiscal year-end, the Company assumes that all interest rate
sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical, immediate 100-basis-point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period.

Interest rate sensitive assets are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12-month period. A portion of the
Company’s credit card receivables has a fixed interest rate, although the Company has the right, with notice to cardmembers, to subsequently reprice these receivables to a



new interest rate. Therefore, the Company considers the receivables with a fixed interest rate to be interest rate sensitive. The Company measured the
earnings sensitivity for these assets from the expected repricing date, which takes into consideration the required notice period and billing cycles. In addition, assets that have a market-based index, such as the prime rate, which will reset before
the end of the 12-month period, or assets with rates that are fixed at fiscal year-end but which will mature, or otherwise contractually reset to a market-based indexed or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12-month period, are rate sensitive.
The latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below-market rates for an introductory period, such as for balance transfers and special promotional programs, after which the loans will contractually reprice in
accordance with the Company’s normal market-based pricing structure. For purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans, only the effect of the hypothetical 100-basis-point change in the underlying market-based indexed or other fixed
rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice. For assets that have a fixed interest rate at fiscal year-end but which contractually will, or are assumed to, reset to a market-based
indexed or other fixed rate during the next 12 months, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. In addition, for all interest rate sensitive assets, earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses.

Interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the
stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12-month period. Thus, liabilities that have a market-based index, such as Fed Funds or LIBOR rates, which will reset before the end of the 12-month period, or liabilities whose rates are
fixed at fiscal year-end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market-based indexed rate prior to the end of the 12-month period, are rate sensitive. For these fixed rate liabilities, earnings sensitivity is measured from the
expected repricing date.

Assuming a hypothetical, immediate 100-basis-point
increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities as of November 30, 2006, it is estimated that the pre-tax income of consumer lending and related activities over the following 12-month period would be
reduced by approximately $125 million. The comparable reduction of pre-tax income for the 12-month period following November 30, 2005 was estimated to be approximately $36 million. The increase in the reduction in pre-tax income at
November 30, 2006 was due to a higher level of variable rate funding.

The
hypothetical model assumes that the balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at fiscal year-end will remain constant over the next 12-month period. It does not assume any growth, strategic change in business focus, change in asset
pricing philosophy or change in asset/liability funding mix. Thus, this model represents a static analysis that cannot adequately portray how the Company would respond to significant changes in market conditions. Furthermore, the analysis does not
necessarily reflect the Company’s expectations regarding the movement of interest rates in the near term, including the likelihood of an immediate 100-basis-point change in market interest rates, nor necessarily the actual effect on earnings if
such rate changes were to occur.

Credit Risk.

Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from borrower or counterparty default when a
borrower, counterparty or obligor is unable to meet its financial obligations. The Company is exposed to three distinct types of credit risk in its businesses. The Company incurs significant, “single-name” credit risk exposure through the
Institutional Securities business. This type of risk requires credit analysis of specific counterparties, both initially and on an ongoing basis. The Company incurs “individual consumer” credit risk in the Global Wealth Management Group
business through margin loans to individual investors, which are generally collateralized, and loans to small businesses. The Company incurs “consumer portfolio” credit risk in the Discover business primarily through cardholder
receivables. Credit risk in a pool of credit card receivables is generally highly diversified, without significant individual exposures, and, accordingly, is managed on a portfolio and not a single-name basis.

The Company has structured its credit risk management framework to reflect that each of these
businesses generates unique credit risks that are appropriately managed discretely. The Institutional Credit Department (“Institutional Credit”) manages credit risk exposure for the Institutional Securities business. Institutional Credit



is responsible for ensuring transparency of material credit risks, ensuring compliance with established limits, approving material extensions of credit, and
escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. Credit risk exposure in the Global Wealth Management Group business is managed through various credit risk committees, whose membership includes Institutional Credit. The Global Wealth
Management Group Risk Management Department is responsible for monitoring, measuring and analyzing credit risk exposures, including margin loans and credit sensitive, higher risk transactions. Credit risk exposure in the Discover business is managed
through the Discover Credit and Market Risk Committee, which, in turn, is supported by business line specific risk committees and the Credit Risk Management Department, which is responsible for the development, validation and implementation of
credit policy criteria, for predictive models, for the monitoring of performance for both new and existing products, and for oversight of adherence to existing policies and limits.

Institutional Securities Activities.

Corporate Lending.

In connection with certain of its Institutional Securities business activities, the Company provides loans or
lending commitments (including bridge financing) to selected clients. These loans and commitments have varying terms, may be senior or subordinated, may be secured or unsecured, are generally contingent upon representations, warranties and
contractual conditions applicable to the borrower, and may be syndicated or traded by the Company. The borrowers may be rated investment grade or non-investment grade. Credit risk with respect to loans and lending commitments arises from the failure
of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement. Commitments associated with these business activities may expire unused, or may be cancelled or reduced at the request of the counterparty, and, therefore, they do not
necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. In addition, commitments associated with acquisition financing activities are generally contingent on the completion of the underlying transaction as well as upon various terms and
conditions, and also can be short-term in nature, as borrowers often replace them with other funding sources.

Securitized Products.

The Company also extends loans and lending commitments to clients that are secured by assets of the borrower and generally provide for
over-collateralization, including commercial real estate, loans secured by loan pools, corporate and operating company loans, and secured lines of revolving credit. Credit risk with respect to these loans and lending commitments arises from the
failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement and a decline in collateral value.

Other.

In addition to the activities performed by Institutional Credit, there are credit risks managed by various business
areas within Institutional Securities. For example, certain businesses with heightened settlement risk monitor compliance with established settlement risk limits. Certain risk management activities as they pertain to establishing appropriate
collateral amounts for the Company’s prime brokerage and securitized product businesses are primarily monitored within those areas in that they determine the appropriate collateral level for each strategy or position. In addition, a collateral
management group monitors collateral levels against requirements and oversees the administration of the collateral function.

Derivative Contracts.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into a variety of derivative contracts related to
financial instruments and commodities. The Company uses these instruments for trading and investment purposes, as well as for asset and liability management. These instruments generally represent future commitments to swap interest payment streams,
exchange currencies, or purchase or sell commodities and other financial instruments on specific terms at specified future dates. Many of these products have maturities that do not extend beyond one year, although swaps, options and equity warrants
typically have longer maturities.

The Company incurs credit risk as a dealer
in OTC derivatives. Credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract. The Company’s exposure to credit risk at any point in time is represented by the
fair value of the derivative contracts reported as assets. The fair value of derivatives represents the amount at which the derivative could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale,
and is further described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Future changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,



or the fair values of the financial instruments, commodities, or indices underlying these contracts ultimately may result in cash settlements exceeding fair
value amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition.

Analyzing Credit Risk.

Credit risk management takes place at the transaction, counterparty and portfolio levels. In order to help protect the Company from losses resulting from these activities,
Institutional Credit analyzes all material lending and derivative transactions and ensures that the creditworthiness of the Company’s counterparties and borrowers is reviewed regularly and that credit exposure is actively monitored and managed.
Institutional Credit assigns obligor credit ratings to the Company’s counterparties and borrowers. These credit ratings are intended to assess a counterparty’s probability of default and are derived using methodologies generally consistent
with those employed by external rating agencies. Credit ratings of “BB+” or below are considered non-investment grade. Additionally, for lending transactions, Institutional Credit evaluates the relative position of the Company’s
particular obligation in the borrower’s capital structure and relative recovery prospects, as well as collateral (if applicable) and other structural elements of the particular transaction. The Company has credit guidelines that limit potential
credit exposure to any one borrower or counterparty and to aggregates of borrowers or counterparties. Institutional Credit administers these limits and monitors and reports credit exposure relative to limits.

Risk Mitigation.

The Company may seek to mitigate credit
risk from its lending and derivatives transactions in multiple ways. At the transaction level, the Company seeks to mitigate risk through management of key risk elements such as size, tenor, seniority and collateral. The Company actively hedges its
lending and derivatives exposure through various financial instruments which may include single name, portfolio and structured credit derivatives. Additionally, the Company may sell, assign or sub-participate funded loans and lending commitments to
other financial institutions in the primary and secondary loan market. In connection with its derivatives trading activities, the Company may enter into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties. These agreements may
provide the Company with the ability to offset a counterparty’s rights and obligations, request additional collateral when necessary or liquidate the collateral in the event of counterparty default.

Credit Exposure-Corporate Lending.

At November 30,
2006 and November 30, 2005, the aggregate value of primary investment grade loans and financial accommodations was $6.4 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, and the aggregate value of primary non-investment grade loans and positions was $3.4
billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. At November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005, the aggregate value of primary lending commitments outstanding was $49.2 billion and $37.0 billion, respectively. The increase from the prior year was
primarily related to acquisition financing activity. In connection with these business activities (which include corporate funded loans and lending commitments), the Company had hedges with a notional amount of $26.5 billion and $17.8 billion at
November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005, respectively, including both internal and external hedges utilized by the lending business. The table below shows the Company’s credit exposure from its corporate lending positions and
commitments as of November 30, 2006. Since commitments associated with these business activities may expire unused, they do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements:

Corporate Lending Commitments and Funded Loans



(1)

Obligor credit ratings are determined by Institutional Credit using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies.

(2)

Total corporate lending exposure includes both primary lending commitments and funded loans.

Credit Exposure-Derivatives.

The table below presents a summary by counterparty credit rating and
remaining contract maturity of the fair value of OTC derivatives in a gain position at November 30, 2006. Fair value represents the risk reduction arising from master netting agreements, where applicable, and, in the final column, net of
collateral received (principally cash and U.S. government and agency securities):

OTC Derivative Products—Financial Instruments Owned(1)

(1)

Fair values shown present the Company’s exposure to counterparties related to the Company’s OTC derivative products. The table does not include the effect of any related
hedges utilized by the Company. The table also excludes fair values corresponding to other credit exposures, such as those arising from the Company’s lending activities.

(2)

Obligor credit ratings are determined by Institutional Credit using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies.

(3)

Amounts represent the netting of receivable balances with payable balances for the same counterparty across maturity categories. Receivable and payable balances with the same
counterparty in the same maturity category are netted within such maturity category, where appropriate. Cash collateral received is netted on a counterparty basis, provided legal right of offset exists.

(4)

In lieu of making an individual assessment of the creditworthiness of unrated companies, the Company makes a determination that the collateral held with respect to such obligations
is sufficient to cover a substantial portion of its exposure. In making this determination, the Company takes into account various factors, including legal uncertainties and market volatility.

The following tables summarize the fair values of the Company’s OTC derivative products
recorded in Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased by product category and maturity at November 30, 2006, including on a net basis, where applicable, reflecting the fair value of related non-cash
collateral for financial instruments owned:

OTC Derivative
Products—Financial Instruments Owned



(1)

Amounts represent the netting of receivable balances with payable balances for the same counterparty across maturity and product categories. Receivable and payable balances with the
same counterparty in the same maturity category are netted within the maturity category, where appropriate. Cash collateral received is netted on a counterparty basis, provided legal right of offset exists.

OTC Derivative Products—Financial Instruments Sold, Not Yet
Purchased(1)

(1)

Since these amounts are liabilities of the Company, they do not result in credit exposures.

(2)

Amounts represent the netting of receivable balances with payable balances for the same counterparty across maturity and product categories. Receivable and payable balances with the
same counterparty in the same maturity category are netted within the maturity category, where appropriate. Cash collateral paid is netted on a counterparty basis, provided legal right of offset exists.

The Company’s derivatives (both listed and OTC) at November 30, 2006 and
November 30, 2005 are summarized in the table below, showing the fair value of the related assets and liabilities by product:

Each category of OTC derivative
products in the above tables includes a variety of instruments, which can differ substantially in their characteristics. Instruments in each category can be denominated in U.S. dollars or in one or more non-U.S. currencies.

The fair values recorded in the above tables are determined by the Company using various
pricing models. For a discussion of fair value as it affects the consolidated financial statements, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies” in Part
II, Item 7 and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. As discussed under “Critical Accounting Policies,” the structure of the transaction, including its maturity, is one of several important factors that may impact the price
transparency. The impact of maturity on price transparency can differ significantly among product categories. For example, single currency and multi-currency interest rate derivative products involving highly standardized terms and the major
currencies (e.g., the U.S. dollar or the euro) will generally have greater price transparency



from published external sources even in maturity ranges beyond 20 years. Credit derivatives with highly standardized terms and liquid underlying reference
instruments can have price transparency from published external sources in a maturity ranging up to 10 years, while equity and foreign exchange derivative products with standardized terms in major currencies can have price transparency from
published external sources within a two-year maturity range. Commodity derivatives with standardized terms and delivery locations can have price transparency from published external sources within various maturity ranges up to 10 years, depending on
the commodity. In most instances of limited price transparency based on published external sources, dealers in these markets, in their capacities as market-makers and liquidity providers, provide price transparency beyond the above maturity ranges.

Country Exposure.

The Company monitors
its credit exposure and risk to individual countries. Credit exposure to a country arises from the Company’s lending activities and derivatives activities in a country. At November 30, 2006, approximately 5% of the
Company’s total credit exposure (including primary corporate loans and lending commitments and current exposure arising from the Company’s derivative contracts) was to emerging markets, and no one emerging market country accounted for more
than 0.6% of the Company’s total credit exposure. Country credit ratings are derived using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies.

Industry Exposure.

The Company also monitors its credit exposure and risk to individual industries.
At November 30, 2006, the Company’s material credit exposure (including primary corporate loans and lending commitments and current exposure arising from the Company’s derivative contracts) was to entities engaged in the
following industries: utilities, sovereign-related entities, financial institutions, media, consumer-related entities and healthcare.

Global Wealth Management Group Activities.

Margin Lending.

Customer margin accounts, the primary source of retail credit exposure, are collateralized in accordance with
internal and regulatory guidelines. The Company monitors required margin levels and established credit limits daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary. Factors
considered in the review of all margin loans are the amount of the loan, the intended purpose, the degree of leverage being employed in the account, and overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification or, in the case of
concentrated positions, possible hedging strategies. Additionally, all transactions relating to concentrated or restricted positions require a review of any legal impediments to liquidation of the underlying collateral. Underlying collateral for
margin loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations. At November 30, 2006, there were approximately $6.8 billion
of customer margin loans outstanding.

Commercial
Lending.

Global Wealth Management Group provides commercial lending to small and medium-size domestic businesses through Morgan Stanley Commercial Financial Services, Inc. (“CFS”). CFS’ suite of products
include working capital lines of credit, revolving lines of credit, standby letters of credit, term loans and owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgages. Clients are required to submit a comprehensive credit application, including financial
statements, to CFS’ centralized credit processing platform. Once the information is received by CFS’ experienced underwriting professionals, a comprehensive analysis is performed to assess the business model and to determine appropriate
structure, guarantors’ strengths, debt and cash flow capacity, liquidity and collateral coverage. For standard transactions, credit requests are approved via signature of independent credit officers, and where transactions are of size and
higher complexity, approval is secured through a formal loan committee chaired by independent credit professionals. The facility is risk rated and upon credit approval is moved to the general portfolio where it is monitored periodically through
account management, covenants compliance certificates, and spot and cycle audits.



Consumer Lending Activities.

With respect to its consumer lending activities, potential credit cardholders undergo credit reviews by the Credit Department of Discover
Financial Services to establish that they meet standards of ability and willingness to pay. Credit card applications are evaluated using scoring models (statistical evaluation models) based on information obtained from applicants and credit bureaus.
The Company’s credit scoring systems include both industry and customized models using the Company’s criteria and historical data. Each cardmember’s credit line is reviewed at least annually, and actions resulting from such review may
include raising or lowering a cardmember’s credit line or closing the account. In addition, the Company, on a portfolio basis, performs periodic monitoring and review of consumer behavior and risk profiles. The Company also reviews the
creditworthiness of prospective Discover Network merchants and conducts annual reviews of merchants, with the greatest scrutiny given to merchants with substantial sales volume, chargeback, return and discount volumes. With respect to first
mortgages and second mortgages within the Company’s Institutional Securities business segment, including home equity lines of credit (“mortgage lending”), a loan evaluation process is adopted within a framework of credit underwriting
policies and collateral valuation. The Company’s underwriting policy is designed to ensure that all borrowers pass an assessment of capacity and willingness to pay, which includes an analysis of applicable industry standard credit scoring
models (e.g., FICO scores), debt ratios and reserves of the borrower. Loan-to-collateral value ratios are determined based on independent third-party property appraisal/valuations, and security lien position is established through title/ownership
reports. As part of the mortgage lending business strategy, almost all loans are sold in the secondary market through securitizations and whole loan sales, while almost all servicing rights are retained. These sales and securitizations pass the risk
of credit loss onto the purchaser/investor. For further information on the Company’s consumer loans, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

Operational Risk.

Operational risk refers to the risk of financial or other loss, or potential damage to a firm’s reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, resources and systems or from external
events (e.g. external or internal fraud, legal and compliance risks, damage to physical assets, etc.). The Company may incur operational risk across the full scope of its business activities, including revenue generating activities (e.g. sales and
trading) and support functions (e.g. information technology and facilities management). As such, the Company may incur operational risk in each of its businesses, as well as within the Control Groups. Legal and compliance risk is included in the
scope of operational risk and is discussed below under “Legal Risk.”

The goal of the Company’s operational risk management framework is to establish firm-wide operational risk standards related to risk measurement, monitoring and management. Operational risk policies are designed to reduce the
likelihood and/or impact of operational incidents as well as to mitigate legal, regulatory and reputational risks.

The Company’s Operational Risk Manager (“ORM”) oversees, monitors, measures and analyzes operational risk across the Company. The ORM is also responsible
for facilitating, designing, implementing and monitoring the firm-wide operational risk program. The ORM is independent of the business segments and is supported by the firm-wide Operational Risk Department (“ORD”). The ORD works with the
business segments, Control Groups and other support functions to help ensure a transparent, consistent and comprehensive framework for managing operational risk within each area and across the Company.

Primary responsibility for the management of operational risk is with the business segments
and the Control Groups, and the business managers therein. The business managers generally maintain processes and controls designed to identify, assess, manage, mitigate and report operational risk. As new products and business activities are
developed and processes are designed and modified, operational risks are considered. Each business segment has a designated operational risk coordinator. In addition, business segment risk committees review operational risk matters and/or reports on
a regular basis. Each Control Group also has a designated operational risk coordinator, or equivalent, and a forum for discussing operational risk matters and/or reports with senior



management. Oversight of business segment operational risk is provided by business segment risk committees, a firmwide operational risk committee and
ultimately senior management through the Firm Risk Committee.

Business
Continuity Planning is an ongoing program of analysis and planning which ensures a recovery strategy and required resources for the resumption of critical business functions following a disaster or other business interruption. Disaster recovery
plans are in place for critical facilities and resources on a Company-wide basis, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. The key components of the Company’s disaster recovery plans include: crisis management;
business segment recovery plans; applications/data recovery; work area recovery; and other elements addressing management, analysis, training and testing.

The Company maintains an information security program that coordinates the management of information security risks and satisfies regulatory requirements. Information
security procedures are designed to protect the Company’s information assets against unauthorized disclosure, modification or misuse. These procedures cover a broad range of areas including: application system entitlement; data protection;
internet and intranet access, communications and usage; and, mobile and portable information usage. The Company has also established policies, procedures and technologies to protect its computer and other assets from unauthorized access.

The Company utilizes the services of external vendors in connection with the
Company’s ongoing operations. These may include, for example, outsourced processing and support functions and consulting and other professional services. The Company manages its exposures to the quality of these services through a variety of
means, including service level and other contractual agreements, service and quality reviews, and ongoing monitoring of the vendors’ performance. It is anticipated that the use of these services will continue and possibly increase in the
future.

Legal Risk.

Legal risk includes the risk of non-compliance with applicable legal and regulatory
requirements and standards. Legal risk also includes contractual and commercial risk such as the risk that a counterparty’s performance obligations will be unenforceable. The Company is generally subject to extensive regulation in the different
jurisdictions in which it conducts its business (see “Business—Regulation” in Part I, Item 1). The Company has established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to foster
compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. The Company, principally through the Legal and Compliance Division, also has established procedures that are designed to require that the Company’s policies relating to conduct,
ethics and business practices are followed globally. In connection with its businesses, the Company has and continuously develops various procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements, sales and trading practices, new
products, potential conflicts of interest, structured transactions, use and safekeeping of customer funds and securities, credit granting, collection activities, money-laundering, privacy and recordkeeping. In addition, the Company has established
procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterparty’s performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction
under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. The legal and regulatory focus on the financial services industry presents a continuing business challenge for the Company.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Introduction and Basis of Presentation.

The Company.

Morgan Stanley (the “Company”) is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of its business segments—Institutional Securities,
Global Wealth Management Group, Asset Management and Discover.

A summary of
the activities of each of the Company’s business segments is as follows:

Institutional Securities

includes capital raising; financial advisory services, including advice on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, real estate and project finance; corporate lending; sales, trading,
financing and market-making activities in equity securities and related products and fixed income securities and related products, including foreign exchange and commodities; benchmark indices and risk management analytics; research; and investment
activities.

Global Wealth Management Group

provides
brokerage and investment advisory services covering various investment alternatives; financial and wealth planning services; annuity and insurance products; credit and other lending products; banking and cash management services; retirement
services; and trust and fiduciary services.

Asset
Management

provides global asset management products and services in equity, fixed income, alternative investments and private equity to institutional and retail clients through proprietary and third party retail distribution channels,
intermediaries and the Company’s institutional distribution channel. Asset Management also engages in investment activities.

Discover

offers Discover

®

-branded credit cards and related consumer products and services and operates the Discover Network, a merchant and cash access network for Discover
Network-branded cards, and PULSE

®

EFT Association
LP (“PULSE”), an automated teller machine/debit and electronic funds transfer network. Discover also offers consumer finance products and services in the U.K., including Morgan Stanley-branded, Goldfish-branded and various other credit
cards issued on the MasterCard and Visa networks.

On December 19, 2006,
the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved the spin-off of Discover (the “Discover Spin-off”). The Discover Spin-off, which is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions, is expected to take place in
the third quarter of fiscal 2007.

Basis of Financial
Information.

The consolidated financial statements for the 12 months ended November 30, 2006 (“fiscal 2006”), November 30, 2005 (“fiscal 2005”) and November 30, 2004
(“fiscal 2004”) are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of certain financial instruments, consumer loan loss
levels, the outcome of litigation, tax and other matters that affect the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are
prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

The Company, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements” (“SAB 108”), adjusted its
opening retained earnings for fiscal 2006 and financial results for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006 to reflect a change in its hedge accounting for certain securities under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivatives Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended (“SFAS No. 133”). The same periods also reflect the adjustments of two compensation and benefit accruals. See Note 24 for additional
information on SAB 108.

All material intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated.



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Consolidation

.    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest.

For entities where (1) the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities independently, and (2) the equity holders bear the
economic residual risks of the entity and have the right to make decisions about the entity’s activities, the Company consolidates those entities it controls through a majority voting interest or otherwise. For entities that do not meet these
criteria, commonly known as variable interest entities (“VIE”), the Company consolidates those entities where the Company absorbs a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns, or both, of such entity.

Notwithstanding the above, certain securitization vehicles, commonly known as
qualifying special purpose entities, are not consolidated by the Company if they meet certain criteria regarding the types of assets and derivatives they may hold, the types of sales they may engage in, and the range of discretion they may exercise
in connection with the assets they hold.

For investments in entities in which
the Company does not have a controlling financial interest, but has significant influence over operating and financial decisions, the Company generally applies the equity method of accounting.

Equity and partnership interests held by entities qualifying for accounting purposes as
investment companies are carried at fair value.

The Company’s U.S. and
international subsidiaries include Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated (“MS&Co.”), Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited (“MSIL”), Morgan Stanley Japan Securities Co., Ltd. (“MSJS”), Morgan
Stanley DW Inc. (“MSDWI”), Morgan Stanley Investment Advisors Inc. and NOVUS Credit Services Inc. In fiscal 2007, the Company intends to merge MSDWI into MS&Co. Upon completion of the merger, the surviving entity, MS&Co., will be
the Company’s principal U.S. broker-dealer.

Income Statement
Presentation

.    The Company, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments,
financial institutions and individuals. In connection with the delivery of the various products and services to clients, the Company manages its revenues and related expenses in the aggregate. As such, when assessing the performance of its
businesses, the Company considers its principal trading, investment banking, commissions and interest and dividend income, along with the associated interest expense and provision for loan losses, as one integrated activity for each of the
Company’s separate businesses.

The Company’s cost infrastructure
supporting its businesses varies by activity. In some cases, these costs are directly attributable to one line of business, and, in other cases, such costs relate to multiple businesses. As such, when assessing the performance of its businesses, the
Company does not consider these costs separately, but rather assesses performance in the aggregate along with the related revenues.

Therefore, the Company’s pricing structure considers various items, including the level of expenses incurred directly and indirectly to support the cost
infrastructure, the risk it incurs in connection with a transaction, the overall client relationship and the availability in the market for the particular product and/or service. Accordingly, the Company does not manage or capture the costs
associated with the products or services sold or its general and administrative costs by revenue line, in total or by product.

Discontinued Operations.

The Company’s aircraft leasing business was classified as “held for sale” prior to its sale
on March 24, 2006, and associated revenues and expenses through the date of sale have been reported as

discontinued operations for all years presented. Prior to being reclassified as discontinued operations, the results of the Company’s aircraft leasing
business were included in the Institutional Securities business segment. See Note 18 for additional information on discontinued operations.

2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

Revenue Recognition.

Investment Banking.

Underwriting revenues and fees for mergers, acquisitions and advisory assignments are recorded when services for the
transactions are determined to be completed, generally as set forth under the terms of the engagement. Transaction-related expenses, primarily consisting of legal, travel and other costs directly associated with the transaction, are deferred and
recognized in the same period as the related investment banking transaction revenue. Underwriting revenues are presented net of related expenses. Non-reimbursed expenses associated with advisory transactions are recorded within Non-interest
expenses.

Commissions.

The Company generates
commissions from executing and clearing customer transactions on stock, options and futures markets. Commission revenues are recorded in the accounts on trade date.

Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees.

Asset management, distribution and administration fees
are recognized over the relevant contract period, generally quarterly or annually. In certain management fee arrangements, the Company is entitled to receive performance fees when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark
returns or other performance targets. In such arrangements, performance fee revenue is accrued quarterly based on measuring account/fund performance to date versus the performance benchmark stated in the investment management agreement.

Merchant, Cardmember and Other Fees,
Net.

Merchant, cardmember and other fees include revenues from fees charged to merchants on credit card sales (net of interchange fees paid to banks that issue cards on the Company’s merchant and cash access network),
transaction processing fees on debit card transactions as well as charges to cardmembers for late payment fees, overlimit fees, balance transfer fees, credit protection fees and cash advance fees, net of cardmember rewards. Merchant, cardmember and
other fees are recognized as earned. Cardmember rewards include various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus

®

reward program, pursuant to which the Company pays certain cardmembers a percentage of their purchase amounts based upon a cardmember’s level and type of purchases. The liability for cardmember
rewards, included in Other liabilities and accrued expenses, is accrued at the time that qualified cardmember transactions occur and is calculated on an individual cardmember basis. In determining the liability for cardmember rewards, the Company
considers estimated forfeitures based on historical account closure, charge-off and transaction activity. The Company records the cost of its cardmember reward programs as a reduction of Merchant, cardmember and other fees.

Consumer Loans.

Consumer loans, which consist primarily of
general purpose credit card, mortgage and consumer installment loans, are reported at their principal amounts outstanding less applicable allowances. Interest on consumer loans is recorded to income as earned. Interest is generally accrued on credit
card loans until the date of charge-off, which generally occurs at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 contractually days past due, except in the case of cardmember bankruptcies, probate accounts, and fraudulent transactions.
Cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off at the end of the month 60 days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death but not later than the 180-day contractual time frame. Fraudulent transactions are reported
in consumer loans at their net realizable value upon receipt of notification of the fraud through a charge to operating expenses and are subsequently written off at the end of the month 90 days following notification but not later than the
contractual 180-day time frame. The interest portion of charged-off credit card loans is written off against interest revenue. Origination costs related to the issuance of credit cards are charged to earnings over periods not exceeding 12 months.



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company classifies a portion of its consumer loans as held for sale. Loans held for sale include the lesser of
loans eligible for securitization or sale, or loans that management intends to securitize within three months, net of amortizing securitizations. These loans are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value.

Financial Instruments Used for Trading and
Investment.

Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased, which include cash and derivative products, are recorded at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition, and
gains and losses are reflected net in Principal transactions trading and investment revenues in the consolidated statements of income. Loans and lending commitments are recorded at fair value or the lower of cost or market, depending on the nature
of the transaction. Fair value is the amount at which financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

The fair value of the Company’s Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments
sold, not yet purchased are generally based on observable market prices, observable market parameters or derived from such prices or parameters based on bid prices or parameters for Financial instruments owned and ask prices or parameters for
Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased. In the case of financial instruments transacted on recognized exchanges, the observable prices represent quotations for completed transactions from the exchange on which the financial instrument is
principally traded. Bid prices represent the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a financial instrument at a particular time. Ask prices represent the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a financial instrument at a particular
time.

A substantial percentage of the fair value of the Company’s
Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased is based on observable market prices, observable market parameters, or is derived from such prices or parameters. The availability of observable market prices and pricing
parameters can vary from product to product. Where available, observable market prices and pricing parameters in a product (or a related product) may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment. In certain markets, observable
market prices or market parameters are not available for all products, and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product. These techniques involve some degree of judgment. The price transparency of the particular
product will determine the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments. Price transparency is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of product, whether it is
a new product and not yet established in the marketplace, and the characteristics particular to the transaction. Products for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted
prices or pricing parameters will generally have a higher degree of price transparency. By contrast, products that are thinly traded or not quoted will generally have reduced to no price transparency.

The fair value of over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivative contracts is derived
primarily using pricing models, which may require multiple market input parameters. Where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for credit quality and market liquidity. These adjustments are applied on a consistent basis and are
based upon observable market data where available. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”), on December 1, 2006, the Company followed the provisions of Emerging Issues Task
Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 02-3, “Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities” (“EITF Issue No. 02-3”). See
also Note 28. Under EITF Issue No. 02-3, in the absence of observable market prices or parameters in an active market, observable prices or parameters of other comparable current market transactions, or other observable data supporting a
fair value based on a pricing model at the inception of a contract, revenue recognition at the inception of an OTC derivative financial instrument is not permitted. Such revenue is recognized in income at the earlier of when there is market value
observability or at the end of the contract period. In the absence of observable market prices or parameters in an active market, observable prices or parameters of other comparable



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

current market transactions, or other observable data supporting a fair value based on a pricing model at the inception of a contract, fair value is based on
the transaction price. The Company also uses pricing models to manage the risks introduced by OTC derivatives. Depending on the product and the terms of the transaction, the fair value of OTC derivative products can be modeled using a series of
techniques, including closed-form analytic formulae, such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulation models or a combination thereof, applied consistently. In the case of more established derivative products, the pricing models used by
the Company are widely accepted by the financial services industry. Pricing models take into account the contract terms, including the maturity, as well as market parameters such as interest rates, volatility and the creditworthiness of the
counterparty.

Purchases and sales of financial instruments and related
expenses are recorded on trade date. Unrealized gains and losses arising from the Company’s dealings in OTC financial instruments, including derivative contracts related to financial instruments and commodities, are presented in the
accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition on a net-by-counterparty basis, when appropriate.

The Company nets cash collateral paid or received against its derivatives inventory under credit support annexes, which the Company views as conditional contracts, pursuant to legally enforceable master netting
agreements.

Equity and debt investments purchased in connection with private
equity and other principal investment activities initially are valued at cost to approximate fair value. The carrying value of such investments is adjusted when changes in the underlying fair values are readily ascertainable, generally as evidenced
by observable market prices or transactions that directly affect the value of such investments. Downward adjustments relating to such investments are made in the event that the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value.
The Company’s partnership interests, including general partnership and limited partnership interests in real estate funds, are included within Other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition and are recorded at fair value
based upon changes in the fair value of the underlying partnership’s net assets.

Financial Instruments Used for Asset and Liability Management

.    The Company applies hedge accounting to various derivative financial instruments used to hedge interest rate, foreign exchange and credit risk
arising from assets, liabilities and forecasted transactions. These instruments are included within Financial instruments owned—derivative contracts or Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased—derivative contracts within the
consolidated statements of financial condition.

These hedges are designated
and qualify for accounting purposes as one of the following types of hedges: hedges of changes in fair value of assets and liabilities due to the risk being hedged (fair value hedges), hedges of the variability of future cash flows from forecasted
transactions and floating rate assets and liabilities due to the risk being hedged (cash flow hedges) and hedges of net investments in foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the reporting currency of the parent company (net
investment hedges).

For all hedges where hedge accounting is being applied,
effectiveness testing and other procedures to ensure the ongoing validity of the hedges are performed at least monthly. The impact of hedge ineffectiveness and amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness on the consolidated
statements of income was not material for all periods presented. If a derivative is de-designated as a hedge, it is thereafter accounted for as a financial instrument used for trading.

Fair Value Hedges.

The Company’s designated fair value hedges consist primarily of benchmark interest
rate hedges of fixed rate borrowings, including certificates of deposit and senior long-term borrowings.



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Interest rate swaps, including swaps with embedded options that mirror features contained in the hedged items, are
used as hedging instruments in these programs. For these hedges, the Company ensures that the terms of the hedging instruments and hedged items match and other accounting criteria are met so that the hedges are assumed to have no ineffectiveness
(i.e., the Company applies the “shortcut” method of hedge accounting).

The Company also uses interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of the benchmark interest rate risk from host contracts of equity-linked notes that contain embedded derivatives. For these hedge relationships, regression analysis is used for
the prospective and retrospective assessments of hedge effectiveness. At the inception of a hedge, the prospective analysis is based on what the hedge results would have been at regular points over an immediately preceding period. Over the life of
the hedge, the length of the observation period and number of data points remain constant and the hypothetical data are replaced with actual hedge results so that the rolling analysis serves as both a prospective and retrospective test.

For qualifying fair value hedges of benchmark interest rates, the changes in the fair
value of the derivative and the changes in the fair value of the hedged liability provide offset of one another and, together with any resulting ineffectiveness, are recorded in Interest expense. If a derivative is de-designated as a hedge, any
basis adjustment remaining on the hedged liability is amortized to Interest expense over the life of the liability using the effective interest method.

The Company has designated a portion of the credit derivative embedded in a non-recourse structured note liability as a fair value hedge of the credit risk arising from a
loan receivable to which the structured note liability is specifically linked. Regression analysis is used to perform prospective and retrospective assessments of hedge effectiveness for this hedge relationship. The changes in the fair value of the
derivative and the changes in the fair value of the hedged item provide offset of one another and, together with any resulting ineffectiveness, are recorded in Principal transactions–Trading revenues.

Cash Flow Hedges.

Before the sale of the aircraft leasing
business (see Note 18), the Company applied hedge accounting to interest rate swaps used to hedge variable rate long-term borrowings associated with this business. Changes in the fair value of the swaps were recorded in Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) in Shareholders’ equity, net of tax effects, and then reclassified to Interest expense as interest on the hedged borrowings was recognized.

In connection with the sale of the aircraft financing business (see Note 18), the Company de-designated the interest rate swaps associated
with this business effective August 31, 2005 and no longer accounts for them as cash flow hedges. Amounts in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to those interest rate swaps continue to be reclassified to Interest expense since the
related borrowings remain outstanding. The Company estimates that approximately $15 million of the unrealized loss recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of November 30, 2006 will be reclassified into earnings within the next
12 months.

Net Investment Hedges.

The Company
utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt to manage the currency exposure relating to its net investments in non-U.S. dollar functional currency operations. No hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings
since the notional amounts of the hedging instruments equal the portion of the investments being hedged, and, where forward contracts are used, the currencies being exchanged are the functional currencies of the parent and investee; where debt
instruments are used as hedges, they are denominated in the functional currency of the investee. The gain or loss from revaluing hedges of net investments in foreign operations at the spot rate is deferred and reported within Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) in Shareholders’ equity, net of tax effects. The forward points on the hedging instruments are recorded in Interest and dividend revenues.



MORGAN STANLEY

Securitization Activities.

The Company engages in securitization activities related to
commercial and residential mortgage loans, corporate bonds and loans, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations, credit card loans and other types of financial assets (see Notes 4 and 5). The Company may retain interests in the securitized
financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization, undivided seller’s interests, accrued interest receivable subordinate to investors’ interests (see Note 5), cash collateral accounts, servicing rights, rights to any excess
cash flows remaining after payments to investors in the securitization trusts of their contractual rate of return and reimbursement of credit losses, and other retained interests. The exposure to credit losses from securitized loans is limited to
the Company’s retained contingent risk, which represents the Company’s retained interest in securitized loans, including any credit enhancement provided. The gain or loss on the sale of financial assets depends, in part, on the previous
carrying amount of the assets involved in the transfer, and each subsequent transfer in revolving structures, allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based upon their respective fair values at the date of sale. To obtain fair
values, observable market prices are used if available. However, observable market prices are generally not available for retained interests so the Company estimates fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows using its best
estimates of the key assumptions, including forecasted credit losses, payment rates, forward yield curves and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. The present value of future net excess cash flows that the Company estimates it will
receive over the term of the securitized loans is recognized in income as the loans are securitized. An asset also is recorded and charged to income over the term of the securitized loans, with actual net excess cash flows continuing to be
recognized in income as they are earned.

Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows.

For purposes of these statements, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments not held for resale with maturities, when purchased, of three months or less. In connection with business
acquisitions, the Company assumed liabilities of $1,377 million, $58 million and $145 million in fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively.

Allowance for Consumer Loan Losses.

The allowance for consumer loan losses is a significant estimate that represents
management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in the owned consumer loan portfolio. The allowance for consumer loan losses is primarily applicable to the owned homogeneous consumer credit card loan portfolio. The allowance is evaluated
quarterly for adequacy and is established through a charge to the Provision for consumer loan losses.

In estimating the allowance for consumer loan losses, the Company uses a systematic and consistently applied approach. This process starts with a migration analysis (a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a
consumer loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off) of delinquent and current consumer credit card accounts in order to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for consumer loan losses. The
migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in consumer loans. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for consumer loan losses, management also considers factors that may impact credit losses, including
current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings, account collection management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties. The Provision for consumer
loan losses is charged against earnings to maintain the allowance for consumer loan losses at an appropriate level.

Office Facilities, Other Equipment and Software Costs.

Office facilities and other equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization of buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, equipment, tugs, barges, terminals and pipelines are provided principally by the straight-line and accelerated methods over the
estimated useful life of the asset. Estimates of useful lives are generally as follows: buildings—39 years; furniture and fixtures—7 years; computer and communications equipment—3 to 5 years; terminals and pipelines—3 to 25
years; and tugs and barges—15 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or, where applicable, the remaining term of the lease, but generally not exceeding 15 years.



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Certain costs incurred in connection with internal-use software projects are capitalized and amortized over the
expected useful life of the asset.

Income
Taxes.

Income tax expense is provided for using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the temporary differences between the financial statement and
income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates.

Earnings per Common Share.

Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities (see Note 10).

Stock-Based Compensation.

The Company early adopted SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”), using the modified prospective approach as of
December 1, 2004. SFAS No. 123R revised the fair value-based method of accounting for share-based payment liabilities, forfeitures and modifications of stock-based awards and clarified guidance in several areas, including measuring fair
value, classifying an award as equity or as a liability and attributing compensation cost to service periods. Upon adoption, the Company recognized an $80 million gain ($49 million after-tax) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 resulting from the requirement to estimate forfeitures at the date of grant instead of recognizing them as incurred. The cumulative effect gain increased both basic and diluted earnings per share in
fiscal 2005 by $0.05.

For stock-based awards issued prior to the adoption of
SFAS No. 123R, the Company’s accounting policy for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees was to recognize compensation cost over the service period specified in the award terms. The Company accelerates any unrecognized
compensation cost for such awards if and when a retirement-eligible employee leaves the Company. For stock-based awards made to retirement-eligible employees during fiscal 2005, the Company recognized compensation expense for such awards on the date
of grant.

For fiscal 2005 year-end stock-based compensation awards that were
granted to retirement-eligible employees in December 2005, the Company recognized the compensation cost for such awards at the date of grant instead of over the service period specified in the award terms. As a result, the Company recorded non-cash
incremental compensation expenses of approximately $270 million in fiscal 2006 for stock-based awards granted to retirement-eligible employees as part of the fiscal 2005 year-end award process. These incremental expenses were included within
Compensation and benefits expense and reduced income before taxes within the Institutional Securities ($190 million), Global Wealth Management Group ($50 million), Asset Management ($20 million) and Discover ($10 million) business segments.

Additionally, based on interpretive guidance related to SFAS No. 123R in
the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company changed its accounting policy for expensing the cost of anticipated fiscal 2006 year-end equity awards that were granted to retirement-eligible employees in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Effective
December 1, 2005, the Company accrues the estimated cost of these awards over the course of the current fiscal year rather than expensing the awards on the date of grant (which occurred in December 2006). The Company believes that this method
of recognition for retirement-eligible employees is preferable because it better reflects the period over which the compensation is earned.

If the Company had accrued the estimated cost of equity awards granted to retirement-eligible employees over the course of the fiscal year ended November 30, 2005
rather than expensing such awards at the grant date in December 2005, net income would have decreased during fiscal 2005. The approximate resulting pro forma net income would have been $4,684 million rather than the reported amount of $4,939
million. The approximate



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

resulting impact on earnings per share for fiscal 2005 would have been a reduction in the reported amounts of earnings per basic share from $4.70 to $4.46
and earnings per diluted share from $4.57 to $4.34.

Translation of
Foreign Currencies.

Assets and liabilities of operations having non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at year-end rates of exchange, and income statement accounts are translated at weighted average rates
of exchange for the year. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements, net of hedge gains or losses and related tax effects, are reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of
Shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in net income.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized and are reviewed annually (or more frequently
under certain conditions) for impairment. Other intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives.

Investments in Unconsolidated Investees.

The Company invests in unconsolidated investees that own synthetic fuel production plants. The Company accounts for these investments under
the equity method. The Company’s share of the operating losses generated by these investments is recorded within Losses from unconsolidated investees, and the tax credits and the tax benefits associated with these operating losses are recorded
within the Provision for income taxes.

Deferred Compensation
Arrangements.

The Company maintains trusts, commonly referred to as rabbi trusts, in connection with certain deferred compensation plans. Assets of rabbi trusts are consolidated, and the value of the Company’s
stock held in rabbi trusts are classified in Shareholders’ equity and generally accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock. The Company has included its obligations under certain deferred compensation plans in Employee stock trust.
Shares that the Company has issued to its rabbi trusts are recorded in Common stock issued to employee trust. Both Employee stock trust and Common stock issued to employee trust are components of Shareholders’ equity. The Company recognizes the
original amount of deferred compensation (fair value of the deferred stock award at the date of grant—see Note 14) as the basis for recognition in Employee stock trust and Common stock issued to employee trust. Changes in the fair value of
amounts owed to employees are not recognized as the Company’s deferred compensation plans do not permit diversification and must be settled by the delivery of a fixed number of shares of the Company’s common stock.

3.    Goodwill and Net Intangible Assets.

During fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, the Company completed the annual goodwill
impairment test (as of December 1 in each fiscal year). The Company’s testing did not indicate any goodwill impairment.



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Changes in the carrying amount of the Company’s goodwill and intangible assets for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005
were as follows:

(1)

Institutional Securities activity includes adjustments to goodwill related to the sale of the Company’s interest in POSIT (see Note 23) and for the recognition of deferred tax
liabilities in connection with the Company’s acquisition of Barra, Inc. (“Barra”). Discover activity represents goodwill and intangible assets acquired in connection with the Company’s acquisition of PULSE (see Note 23).

(2)

Institutional Securities activity primarily represents goodwill and intangible assets acquired in connection with the Company’s acquisition of TransMontaigne Inc., Heidmar
Group and Nan Tung Bank Ltd. Zhuhai. Discover activity represents goodwill and intangible assets acquired in connection with the Company’s acquisition of Goldfish and other acquisitions (see Note 23).

(3)

Amount is related to the sale of the Company’s interest in POSIT (see Note 23).

Amortizable intangible assets, which are included in the Institutional Securities, Asset Management and Discover business segments, were as
follows:

Amortization expense associated with
intangible assets is estimated to be approximately $58 million per year over the next five fiscal years.



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

4.    Collateralized and Securitization Transactions.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell (“reverse repurchase agreements”)
and Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“repurchase agreements”), principally government and agency securities, are carried at the amounts at which the securities subsequently will be resold or reacquired as specified in the
respective agreements; such amounts include accrued interest. Reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements are presented on a net-by-counterparty basis, when appropriate. The Company’s policy is to take possession of securities
purchased under agreements to resell. Securities borrowed and Securities loaned are carried at the amounts of cash collateral advanced and received in connection with the transactions. Other secured financings include the liabilities related to
transfers of financial assets that are accounted for as financings rather than sales, consolidated variable interest entities where the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and certain equity-referenced securities and loans where in all
instances these liabilities are payable solely from the cash flows of the related assets accounted for as Financial instruments owned.

The Company pledges its financial instruments owned to collateralize repurchase agreements and other securities financings. Pledged securities that can be sold or
repledged by the secured party are identified as Financial instruments owned (pledged to various parties) in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The carrying value and classification of securities owned by the Company that have been
loaned or pledged to counterparties where those counterparties do not have the right to sell or repledge the collateral were as follows:

The Company enters into reverse
repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements, securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions to, among other things, acquire securities to cover short positions and settle other securities obligations, to accommodate customers’ needs
and to finance the Company’s inventory positions. The Company also engages in securities financing transactions for customers through margin lending. Under these agreements and transactions, the Company either receives or provides collateral,
including U.S. government and agency securities, other sovereign government obligations, corporate and other debt, and corporate equities. The Company receives collateral in the form of securities in connection with reverse repurchase agreements,
securities borrowed and derivative transactions, and customer margin loans. In many cases, the Company is permitted to sell or repledge these securities held as collateral and use the securities to secure repurchase agreements, to enter into
securities lending and derivative transactions or for delivery to counterparties to cover short positions. At November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005, the fair value of securities received as collateral where the Company is permitted to
sell or repledge the securities was $942 billion and $798 billion, respectively, and the fair value of the portion that had been sold or repledged was $780 billion and $737 billion, respectively.

The Company additionally receives securities as collateral in connection with certain
securities for securities transactions in which the Company is the lender. In instances where the Company is permitted to sell or repledge these securities, the Company reports the fair value of the collateral received and the related obligation to
return the collateral in the consolidated statement of financial condition. At November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005, $64,588 million and $43,557 million, respectively, were reported as Securities received as collateral and an Obligation to return
securities received as collateral in the consolidated statements of financial condition.



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company manages credit exposure arising from reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements, securities
borrowed and securities loaned transactions by, in appropriate circumstances, entering into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties that provide the Company, in the event of a customer default, the right to
liquidate collateral and the right to offset a counterparty’s rights and obligations. The Company also monitors the fair value of the underlying securities as compared with the related receivable or payable, including accrued interest, and, as
necessary, requests additional collateral to ensure such transactions are adequately collateralized. Where deemed appropriate, the Company’s agreements with third parties specify its rights to request additional collateral. Customer receivables
generated from margin lending activity are collateralized by customer-owned securities held by the Company. For these transactions, adherence to the Company’s collateral policies significantly limits the Company’s credit exposure in the
event of customer default. The Company may request additional margin collateral from customers, if appropriate, and, if necessary, may sell securities that have not been paid for or purchase securities sold, but not delivered from customers.

In connection with its Institutional Securities business, the Company engages
in securitization activities related to residential and commercial mortgage loans, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate bonds and loans, and other types of financial assets. These assets are carried at fair value, and any
changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The Company may act as underwriter of the beneficial interests issued by securitization vehicles. Underwriting net revenues are recognized in connection with these
transactions. The Company may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. These retained interests are included in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value. Any changes
in the fair value of such retained interests are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Retained interests in securitized financial assets associated with the Institutional Securities business were approximately $4.8 billion at
November 30, 2006, the majority of which were related to residential mortgage loan, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligation and commercial mortgage loan securitization transactions. Net gains at the time of securitization were not
material in fiscal 2006. The assumptions that the Company used to determine the fair value of its retained interests at the time of securitization related to those transactions that occurred during fiscal 2006 were not materially different from the
assumptions included in the table below. Additionally, as indicated in the table below, the Company’s exposure to credit losses related to these retained interests was not material to the Company’s results of operations.

The following table presents information on the Company’s residential mortgage loan,
U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligation and commercial mortgage loan securitization transactions. Key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of the retained interests to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in
those assumptions at November 30, 2006 were as follows (dollars in millions):

(1)

Amounts for residential mortgage loans exclude positive valuation effects from immediate 10% and 20% changes.

(2)

Commercial mortgage loans typically contain provisions that either prohibit or economically penalize the borrower from prepaying the loan for a specified period of time.



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The table above does not include the offsetting benefit of any financial instruments that the Company may utilize to
hedge risks inherent in its retained interests. In addition, the sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based on a 10% or 20% variation in an assumption generally cannot be extrapolated because
the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interests is calculated independent of changes in any other
assumption; in practice, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities. In addition, the sensitivity analysis does not consider any corrective action that the Company may take to mitigate
the impact of any adverse changes in the key assumptions.

In connection with
its Institutional Securities business, during fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, the Company received proceeds from new securitization transactions of $68 billion, $65 billion and $72 billion, respectively, and cash flows from retained
interests in securitization transactions of $6.0 billion, $7.1 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively.

Amounts relate to the Company’s acquisition of Goldfish (see Note 23) and other acquisitions.



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Information on net charge-offs of interest and cardmember fees was as follows:

At November 30, 2006, the Company
had commitments to extend credit for consumer loans of approximately $274 billion. Such commitments arise primarily from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards, provided that there are no violations of
conditions established in the related agreements. These commitments, substantially all of which the Company can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage
and customer creditworthiness.

At November 30, 2006 and November 30,
2005, $5,570 million and $4,960 million, respectively, of the Company’s consumer loans had minimum contractual maturities of less than one year. Because of the uncertainty regarding consumer loan repayment patterns, which historically have been
higher than contractually required minimum payments, this amount may not necessarily be indicative of the Company’s actual consumer loan repayments.

The Company received net proceeds from consumer loan sales of $11,532 million, $10,525 million and $7,590 million in fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004,
respectively.

At November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005, $2.3
billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, of the Company’s consumer loans were classified as held for sale.

The Company’s U.S. consumer loan portfolio, including securitized loans, is geographically diverse, with a distribution approximating that of the population of the U.S.

Credit Card Securitization Activities.

The
Company’s retained interests in credit card asset securitizations include undivided seller’s interests, accrued interest receivable on securitized credit card receivables, cash collateral accounts, servicing rights, rights to any excess
cash flows (“Residual Interests”) remaining after payments to investors in the securitization trusts of their contractual rate of return and reimbursement of credit losses, and other retained interests. The undivided seller’s
interests less an applicable allowance for loan losses is recorded in Consumer loans. The Company’s undivided seller’s interests rank

pari passu

with investors’ interests in the securitization trusts, and the remaining retained
interests are subordinate to investors’ interests. Accrued interest receivable and certain other subordinated retained interests are recorded in Other assets at amounts that approximate fair value. The Company receives annual servicing fees of
2% of the investor principal balance outstanding. The Company does not recognize servicing assets or servicing liabilities for servicing rights as the servicing contracts provide just adequate compensation, as defined in SFAS No. 140,
“Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities” (“SFAS No. 140”), to the Company for performing the servicing. Residual Interests and cash collateral accounts are recorded in
Other assets and reflected at fair value with changes in fair value recorded currently in earnings. At November 30, 2006, the Company had $12,661 million of retained interests, including $9,370 million of undivided seller’s interests, in



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

credit card asset securitizations. The retained interests are subject to credit, payment and interest rate risks on the transferred credit card assets. The
investors and the securitization trusts have no recourse to the Company’s other assets for failure of cardmembers to pay when due.

During fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, the Company completed credit card asset securitizations of $8.7 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, and recognized net
securitization gains of $159 million and net securitization losses of $78 million, respectively, as servicing and securitization income in the consolidated statements of income. The amount for fiscal 2006 includes an increase in the fair value of
the Company’s retained interests in securitized credit card receivables primarily resulting from a favorable impact on charge-offs following the enactment of federal bankruptcy legislation effective in October 2005. The uncollected balances of
securitized general purpose credit card loans were $26.7 billion and $24.4 billion at November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005, respectively.

Key economic assumptions used in measuring the Residual Interests at the date of securitization resulting from credit card asset securitizations completed during fiscal
2006 and fiscal 2005 were as follows:

Key economic assumptions and the
sensitivity of the current fair value of the Residual Interests to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in those assumptions were as follows (dollars in millions):

The sensitivity analysis in the table
above is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based on a 10% or 20% variation in an assumption generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may
not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the Residual Interests is calculated independent of changes in any other assumption; in practice, changes in one factor may result in changes in another
(for example, increases in market interest rates may result in lower payments and increased credit losses), which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities. In addition, the sensitivity analysis does not consider any corrective action that the
Company may take to mitigate the impact of any adverse changes in the key assumptions.

Deposits were as follows:

The weighted average interest rates of
interest-bearing deposits outstanding during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 were 4.4% and 4.1%, respectively. The increase in deposits in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected growth in the Company’s bank deposit program.

At November 30, 2006, interest-bearing deposits maturing over the next five years were
as follows:

7.    Short-Term Borrowings.

The table below summarizes certain information regarding short-term borrowings for fiscal
2006 and fiscal 2005 (dollars in millions):

(1)

These borrowings included bank loans, Federal Funds and bank notes.

The Company maintains a senior revolving credit agreement with a group of banks to support general liquidity needs, including the issuance of commercial paper, which
consists of three separate tranches: a U.S. dollar tranche with the Company as borrower; a Japanese yen tranche with MSJS as borrower and the Company as borrower and guarantor for MSJS borrowings; and a multicurrency tranche available in both euro
and sterling with the Company as borrower. Under this combined facility (the “Credit Facility”), the banks are committed to provide up to $7.5 billion under the U.S. dollar tranche, 80 billion Japanese yen under the Japanese yen tranche
and $3.25 billion under the multicurrency tranche. At November 30, 2006, the Company had a $16.4 billion consolidated stockholders’ equity surplus as compared with the Credit Facility’s covenant requirement.

The Company anticipates that it may utilize the Credit Facility for short-term funding from
time to time. The Company does not believe that any of the covenant requirements in its Credit Facility will impair its ability to obtain funding under the Credit Facility, pay its current level of dividends or obtain loan arrangements, letters of
credit and other financial guarantees or other financial accommodations. At November 30, 2006, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Facility.

The Company and its subsidiaries also maintain certain committed bilateral credit facilities to support general liquidity needs. These facilities are expected to be drawn
from time to time to cover short-term funding needs.

The Company, through
several of its subsidiaries, maintains several funded committed credit facilities to support various businesses, including (without limitation) the collateralized commercial and residential mortgage whole loan, derivative contracts, warehouse
lending, emerging market loan, structured product, corporate loan, investment banking and prime brokerage businesses.

8.    Long-Term Borrowings.

Maturities and Terms.

Long-term borrowings at fiscal year-end consisted of the following:

(1)

Weighted average coupon was calculated utilizing non-U.S. dollar interest rates.

(2)

U.S. dollar contractual floating rate borrowings bear interest based on a variety of money market indices, including London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”) and Federal
Funds rates. Non-U.S. dollar contractual floating rate borrowings bear interest based primarily on Euribor floating rates.

(3)

Amounts include a decrease of approximately $326 million at November 30, 2006 and $324 million at November 30, 2005 to the carrying amount of certain of the Company’s
long-term borrowings associated with fair value hedges under SFAS No. 133.

The Company’s long-term borrowings included the following components:

Senior debt securities often are
denominated in various non-U.S. dollar currencies and may be structured to provide a return that is equity-linked, credit-linked or linked to some other index (e.g., the consumer price index). Senior debt also may be structured to be callable by the
Company or extendible at the option of holders of the senior debt securities. Debt containing provisions that effectively allow the holders to put or extend the notes aggregated $16,016 million at November 30, 2006 and $16,018 million at
November 30, 2005. Subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures typically are issued to meet the capital requirements of the Company or its regulated subsidiaries and primarily are U.S. dollar denominated.

Senior Debt—Structured Borrowings.

The
Company’s index/equity-linked borrowings include various structured instruments whose payments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index (e.g., Standard & Poor’s 500), a basket of stocks, a specific
equity security, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures. To minimize the exposure resulting from movements in the underlying equity, credit, or other position or index, the Company has entered into various swap contracts and purchased
options that effectively convert the



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

borrowing costs into floating rates based upon LIBOR. These instruments are included in the preceding table at their redemption values based on the
performance of the underlying indices, baskets of stocks, or specific equity securities, credit or other position or index. The Company accounts for its structured borrowings as having embedded derivatives. The embedded derivatives are bifurcated
from the hybrid notes and are accounted for at fair value, with the changes in fair value reported in Principal transactions trading revenues. The swaps and purchased options used to economically hedge the embedded features are derivatives and also
are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Principal transactions trading revenues.

Subordinated Debt and Junior Subordinated Debentures

.

Included in the Company’s long-term borrowings are subordinated notes (including the notes issued by MS&Co.
discussed below) of $3,881 million having a contractual weighted average coupon of 4.77% at November 30, 2006 and $4,007 million having a weighted average coupon of 4.86% at November 30, 2005. Junior subordinated debentures issued by the
Company were $4,884 million at November 30, 2006 and $2,764 million at November 30, 2005 having a contractual weighted average coupon of 6.51% at November 30, 2006 and 6.45% at November 30, 2005. Maturities of the subordinated
and junior subordinated notes range from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2033. Maturities of certain junior subordinated debentures can be extended to 2066 at the Company’s option.

At November 30, 2006, MS&Co. had outstanding a $25 million 7.82% fixed rate subordinated Series F note. The note matures in fiscal
2016. The terms of the note contain restrictive covenants that require, among other things, MS&Co. to maintain specified levels of Consolidated Tangible Net Worth and Net Capital, each as defined. As of November 30, 2006, MS&Co. was in
compliance with these restrictive covenants.

Asset and Liability
Management.

In general, securities inventories not financed by secured funding sources and the majority of current assets are financed with a combination of short-term funding, floating rate long-term debt or fixed
rate long-term debt swapped to a floating rate. Fixed assets are financed with fixed rate long-term debt. Both fixed rate long-term debt and floating rate long-term debt (in addition to sources of funds accessed directly by the Company’s
Discover business segment) are used to finance the Company’s consumer loan portfolio. The Company uses interest rate swaps to more closely match these borrowings to the duration, holding period and interest rate characteristics of the assets
being funded and to manage interest rate risk. These swaps effectively convert certain of the Company’s fixed rate borrowings into floating rate obligations. In addition, for non-U.S. dollar currency borrowings that are not used to fund assets
in the same currency, the Company has entered into currency swaps that effectively convert the borrowings into U.S. dollar obligations. The Company’s use of swaps for asset and liability management affected its effective average borrowing rate
as follows:

Subsequent to fiscal year-end and through January 31,
2007, the Company’s long-term borrowings (net of repayments) increased by approximately $11 billion.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

9.    Commitments and Contingencies.

Office Facilities.

The Company has non-cancelable
operating leases covering office space and equipment. At November 30, 2006, future minimum rental commitments under such leases (net of subleases, principally on office rentals) were as follows (dollars in millions):

Occupancy lease agreements, in
addition to base rentals, generally provide for rent and operating expense escalations resulting from increased assessments for real estate taxes and other charges. Total rent expense, net of sublease rental income, was $491 million, $595 million
and $444 million in fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. The net rent expense for fiscal 2005 included $109 million related to the lease adjustment charge recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 (see Note 26).

Equipment.

In connection with its commodities business,
the Company enters into operating leases for both crude oil and refined products storage and for vessel charters. These operating leases are integral parts of the Company’s commodities risk management business. At November 30, 2006, future
minimum rental commitments under such leases were as follows (dollars in millions):

Letters of Credit and Other
Financial Guarantees.

At November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005, the Company had approximately $5.8 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively, of letters of credit and other financial guarantees outstanding to
satisfy various collateral requirements.

Securities
Activities.

In connection with certain of its Institutional Securities business activities, the Company provides loans or lending commitments (including bridge financing) to selected clients. The borrowers may be rated
investment grade or non-investment grade. These loans and commitments have varying terms, may be senior or subordinated, are generally contingent upon representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower, and may be
syndicated or traded by the Company.



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The aggregate value of the investment grade and non-investment grade primary and secondary lending commitments are
shown below:

Financial instruments sold, not yet
purchased include obligations of the Company to deliver specified financial instruments at contracted prices, thereby creating commitments to purchase the financial instruments in the market at prevailing prices. Consequently, the Company’s
ultimate obligation to satisfy the sale of financial instruments sold, not yet purchased may exceed the amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition.

The Company has commitments to fund other less liquid investments, including at November 30, 2006, $1,279 million in connection with
investment activities, $15,888 million related to secured lending transactions and $5,062 million related to forward purchase contracts involving mortgage loans. Additionally, the Company has provided and will continue to provide financing,
including margin lending and other extensions of credit, to clients that may subject the Company to increased credit and liquidity risks.

At November 30, 2006, the Company had commitments to enter into reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements of approximately $104 billion and $76 billion,
respectively.

Legal.

In the normal course
of business, the Company has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services
institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the issuers that would otherwise be the primary
defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress.

The Company is
also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the Company’s business, including, among other matters, accounting and
operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. The number of these reviews, investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in
the financial services industry, including the Company.

The Company contests
liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where
investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, the Company cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters, how or if such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what the
eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be. Subject to the foregoing, and except for the pending matter described in the paragraphs below, the Company believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with
counsel, that the outcome of the pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

of the Company, although the outcome of such matters could be material to the Company’s operating results and cash flows for a particular future period,
depending on, among other things, the level of the Company’s revenues or income for such period. Legal reserves have been established in accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (“SFAS No. 5”). Once
established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change.

Coleman Litigation.

On May 8, 2003, Coleman (Parent) Holdings Inc. (“CPH”) filed a complaint against the Company in
the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit for Palm Beach County, Florida. The complaint relates to the 1998 merger between The Coleman Company, Inc. (“Coleman”) and Sunbeam, Inc. (“Sunbeam”). The complaint, as amended,
alleges that CPH was induced to agree to the transaction with Sunbeam based on certain financial misrepresentations, and it asserts claims against the Company for aiding and abetting fraud, conspiracy and punitive damages. Shortly before trial,
which commenced in April 2005, the trial court granted, in part, a motion for entry of a default judgment against the Company and ordered that portions of CPH’s complaint, including those setting forth CPH’s primary allegations against the
Company, be read to the jury and deemed established for all purposes in the action. In May 2005, the jury returned a verdict in favor of CPH and awarded CPH $604 million in compensatory damages and $850 million in punitive damages. On June 23,
2005, the trial court issued a final judgment in favor of CPH in the amount of $1,578 million, which includes prejudgment interest and excludes certain payments received by CPH in settlement of related claims against others.

On June 27, 2005, the Company filed a notice of appeal with the District Court of Appeal
for the Fourth District of Florida (the “Court of Appeal”) and posted a supersedeas bond, which automatically stayed execution of the judgment pending appeal. Included in cash and securities deposited with clearing organizations or
segregated under federal and other regulations or requirements in the consolidated statement of financial condition is $1,840 million of money market deposits that have been pledged to obtain the supersedeas bond. The Company filed its initial brief
in support of its appeal on December 7, 2005, and, on June 28, 2006, the Court of Appeal heard oral argument. The Company’s appeal seeks to reverse the judgment of the trial court on several grounds and asks that the case be remanded
for entry of a judgment in favor of the Company or, in the alternative, for a new trial.

The Company believes, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is probable that the compensatory and punitive damages awards will be overturned on appeal and the case remanded for a new trial. Taking into
account the advice of outside counsel, the Company is maintaining a reserve of $360 million for the Coleman litigation, which it believes to be a reasonable estimate, under SFAS No. 5, of the low end of the range of its probable exposure in the
event the judgment is overturned and the case remanded for a new trial. If the compensatory and/or punitive awards are ultimately upheld on appeal, in whole or in part, the Company may incur an additional expense equal to the difference between the
amount affirmed on appeal (and post-judgment interest thereon) and the amount of the reserve. While the Company cannot predict with certainty the amount of such additional expense, such additional expense could have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial condition of the Company and/or the Company’s or Institutional Securities’ operating results and cash flows for a particular future period, and the upper end of the range could exceed $1.4 billion.

Income Taxes.

11.    Sales and Trading Activities.

The Company’s institutional sales and trading activities are conducted through the
integrated management of its client-driven and proprietary transactions along with the hedging and financing of these positions. Sales and trading activities include revenues from customer purchases and sales of financial instruments in which the
Company acts as principal and gains and losses on the Company’s positions. The Company also engages in proprietary trading activities for its own account.

The Company’s trading portfolios are managed with a view toward the risk and profitability of the portfolios. The following discussions of risk management, market
risk, credit risk, concentration risk and customer activities relate to the Company’s sales and trading activities.

Risk Management.

The cornerstone of the Company’s risk management philosophy is protection of the Company’s franchise,
reputation and financial standing. The Company’s risk management philosophy is based on the following principles: comprehensiveness, independence, accountability, defined risk tolerance and transparency. Given the importance of effective risk
management to the Company’s reputation, senior management requires thorough and frequent communication and appropriate escalation of risk matters.

Risk management at the Company requires independent Company-level oversight, accountability of the Company’s business segments, constant communication, judgment, and
knowledge of specialized products and markets. The Company’s senior management takes an active role in the identification, assessment and management of various risks at both the Company and business segment level. In recognition of the
increasingly varied and complex nature of the global financial services business, the Company’s risk management philosophy, with its attendant policies, procedures and methodologies, is evolutionary in nature and subject to ongoing review and
modification.

The nature of the Company’s risks, coupled with this risk
management philosophy, informs the Company’s risk governance structure. The Company’s risk governance structure includes the Firm Risk Committee and the Capital Structure and Strategic Transactions Committee, the Chief Risk Officer, the
Internal Audit Department, independent control groups, and various risk control managers, committees and groups located within the business segments.

The Firm Risk Committee, composed of the Company’s most senior officers, oversees the Company’s risk management structure. The Firm Risk Committee’s
responsibilities include oversight of the Company’s risk management principles, procedures and limits, and the monitoring of material financial, operational and franchise risks. The Firm Risk Committee is overseen by the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors (the “Audit Committee”). The Capital Structure and Strategic Transactions Committee (the “Capital Committee”) reviews strategic transactions for the Company and significant changes to the Company’s capital
structure. The Capital Committee’s responsibilities include reviewing measures of capital and evaluating capital resources relative to the Company’s risk profile and strategy.

The Chief Risk Officer, a member of the Firm Risk Committee, oversees compliance with Company risk limits; approves certain excessions of
Company risk limits; reviews material market and credit risks; and reviews results of risk management processes with the Audit Committee.

The Internal Audit Department provides independent risk and control assessment and reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the Chief Legal Officer. The
Internal Audit Department periodically examines the Company’s operational and control environment and conducts audits designed to cover all major risk categories.



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Market Risk, Credit Risk, Operational Risk, Financial Control, Treasury, and Legal and Compliance Departments
(collectively, the “Company Control Groups”), which are all independent of the Company’s business units, assist senior management and the Firm Risk Committee in monitoring and controlling the Company’s risk through a number of
control processes. The Company is committed to employing qualified personnel with appropriate expertise in each of its various administrative and business areas to implement effectively the Company’s risk management and monitoring systems and
processes.

Each business segment has a risk committee that is responsible for
ensuring that the business segment, as applicable, adheres to established limits for market, credit, operational and other risks; implements risk measurement, monitoring, and management policies and procedures that are consistent with the risk
framework established by the Firm Risk Committee; and reviews, on a periodic basis, its aggregate risk exposures, risk exception experience, and the efficacy of its risk identification, measurement, monitoring and management policies and procedures,
and related controls.

Each of the Company’s business segments also has
designated operations officers, committees and groups, including operations and information technology groups (collectively, “Segment Control Groups” and, together with the Company Control Groups, the “Control Groups”) to manage
and monitor specific risks and report to the business segment risk committee. The Control Groups work together to review the risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to, among other things, the business segment’s
market and credit risk profile, sales practices, pricing of consumer loans and reserve adequacy, reputation, legal enforceability, and operational and technological risks. Participation by the senior officers of the Control Groups helps ensure that
risk policies and procedures, exceptions to risk limits, new products and business ventures, and transactions with risk elements undergo a thorough review.

Market Risk.

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied
volatilities (the price volatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices), correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio.

The Company manages the market risk associated with its trading activities on a Company-wide
basis, on a worldwide trading division level and on an individual product basis. Aggregate market risk limits have been approved for the Company and for its major trading divisions worldwide (equity and fixed income, which includes interest rate
products, credit products, foreign exchange and commodities). Additional market risk limits are assigned to trading desks and, as appropriate, products and regions. Trading division risk managers, desk risk managers, traders and the Market Risk
Department monitor market risk measures against limits in accordance with policies set by senior management.

The Market Risk Department independently reviews the Company’s trading portfolios on a regular basis from a market risk perspective utilizing Value-at-Risk and other quantitative and qualitative risk measures and
analyses. The Company’s trading businesses and the Market Risk Department also use, as appropriate, measures such as sensitivity to changes in interest rates, prices, implied volatilities and time decay to monitor and report market risk
exposures. Stress testing, which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified changes in market factors for certain products, is performed periodically and is reviewed by trading division risk managers, desk risk managers and
the Market Risk Department. The Market Risk Department also conducts scenario analyses, which estimate the Company’s revenue sensitivity to a set of specific, predefined market and geopolitical events.

Credit Risk.

Credit risk refers to the risk of loss
arising from borrower or counterparty default when a borrower, counterparty or obligor is unable to meet its financial obligations. The Company incurs significant, “single name” credit risk exposure through the Institutional Securities
business. This type of risk requires credit analysis of specific counterparties, both initially and on an ongoing basis.



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Institutional Credit Department (“Institutional Credit”) manages credit risk exposure for the
Institutional Securities business. Institutional Credit is responsible for ensuring transparency of material credit risks, ensuring compliance with established limits, approving material extensions of credit, and escalating risk concentrations to
appropriate senior management.

Concentration
Risk.

The Company is subject to concentration risk by holding large positions in certain types of securities or commitments to purchase securities of a single issuer, including sovereign governments and other entities,
issuers located in a particular country or geographic area, public and private issuers involving developing countries, or issuers engaged in a particular industry. Financial instruments owned by the Company include U.S. government and agency
securities and securities issued by other sovereign governments (principally Japan, United Kingdom, Italy and Germany), which, in the aggregate, represented approximately 6% of the Company’s total assets at November 30, 2006. In addition,
substantially all of the collateral held by the Company for resale agreements or bonds borrowed, which together represented approximately 25% of the Company’s total assets at November 30, 2006, consist of securities issued by the U.S.
government, federal agencies or other sovereign government obligations. Positions taken and commitments made by the Company, including positions taken and underwriting and financing commitments made in connection with its private equity, principal
investment and lending activities, often involve substantial amounts and significant exposure to individual issuers and businesses, including non-investment grade issuers. In addition, the Company may originate or purchase certain residential and
commercial mortgage loans that could contain certain terms and features that may result in additional credit risk as compared with more traditional types of mortgages. Such terms and features may include loans made to borrowers subject to payment
increases or loans with high loan-to-value ratios. The Company seeks to limit concentration risk through the use of the systems and procedures described in the preceding discussions of risk management, market risk and credit risk.

Customer Activities.

The Company’s customer
activities involve the execution, settlement and financing of various securities and commodities transactions on behalf of customers. Customer securities activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis. Customer commodities activities,
which include the execution of customer transactions in commodity futures transactions (including options on futures), are transacted on a margin basis.

The Company’s customer activities may expose it to off-balance sheet credit risk. The Company may have to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market
prices in the event of the failure of a customer to settle a trade on its original terms or in the event cash and securities in customer margin accounts are not sufficient to fully cover customer losses. The Company seeks to control the risks
associated with customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulations and Company policies.

Derivative Contracts.

The amounts in the following table represent unrealized gains and losses on exchange traded and OTC options and
other contracts (including interest rate, foreign exchange, and other forward contracts and swaps) for derivatives for trading and investment purposes and for asset and liability management, net of offsetting positions in situations where netting is
appropriate. The asset amounts are not reported net of non-cash collateral, which the Company obtains with respect to certain of these transactions to reduce its exposure to credit losses.

Credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the failure of a counterparty
to perform according to the terms of the contract. The Company’s exposure to credit risk at any point in time is represented by the fair value of the derivative contracts reported as assets. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of
counterparties to these transactions on an ongoing basis and requests additional collateral when deemed necessary.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company’s derivatives (both listed and OTC) at November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005 are
summarized in the table below, showing the fair value of the related assets and liabilities by product:

12.    Capital
Units.

The Company has Capital Units outstanding that were issued by the
Company and Morgan Stanley Finance plc (“MSF”), a U.K. subsidiary. A Capital Unit consists of (a) a Subordinated Debenture of MSF guaranteed by the Company and maturing in 2017 and (b) a related Purchase Contract issued by the
Company, which may be accelerated by the Company, requiring the holder to purchase one Depositary Share representing shares of the Company’s Cumulative Preferred Stock. The aggregate amount of Capital Units outstanding was $66 million at both
November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005. Subsequent to fiscal year-end, the Company and MSF announced the Company’s intention to redeem all of the outstanding Capital Units on February 28, 2007.

13.    Shareholders’ Equity.

Common Stock.

Changes in shares of common stock
outstanding for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 were as follows (share data in millions):

Treasury
Shares.

During fiscal 2006, the Company purchased $3.4 billion of its common stock through open market purchases at an average cost of $65.43 per share. During fiscal 2005, the Company purchased $3.7 billion of its
common stock through a combination of open market purchases and purchases from employees at an average cost of $54.31 per share. In December 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $6 billion of
the Company’s outstanding common stock. This share repurchase authorization replaces the Company’s previous repurchase authorizations with one repurchase program for capital management purposes that will consider, among other things,
business segment capital needs, as well as equity-based compensation and benefit plan requirements. The Company expects to exercise the authorization over the next 12-18 months at prices the Company deems appropriate, subject to its surplus capital
position, market conditions and regulatory considerations.

Rabbi Trusts.

The Company has established rabbi trusts (the “Trusts”)
to provide common stock voting rights to certain employees who hold outstanding restricted stock units. The number of shares of common stock outstanding in the Trusts was 81 million at November 30, 2006 and 60 million at
November 30, 2005. The assets of the Trusts are consolidated with those of the Company, and the value of the Company’s stock held in the Trusts is classified in Shareholders’ equity and generally accounted for in a manner similar to
treasury stock.

Preferred
Stock

.

In July 2006, the Company issued 44,000,000 Depositary Shares, in an aggregate of $1,100 million, representing 1/1,000th of a Share of Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series
A, $0.01 par value (“Series A Preferred Stock”). The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Company’s option in whole or in part on or after July 15, 2011 at a redemption price of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $25
per Depositary Share). The Series A Preferred Stock also has a preference over the Company’s common stock upon liquidation. Subsequent to fiscal year-end, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $388.045 per share of Series A Preferred
Stock that was paid on January 16, 2007 to preferred shareholders of record on January 1, 2007.

Regulatory Requirements.

MS&Co. and MSDWI are registered broker-dealers and registered futures commission merchants and, accordingly, are subject to the minimum net
capital requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. MS&Co. and MSDWI have consistently operated in excess of these requirements.
MS&Co.’s net capital totaled $4,498 million at November 30, 2006, which exceeded the amount required by $3,168 million. MSDWI’s net capital totaled $1,251 million at November 30, 2006, which exceeded the amount required by
$1,180 million. MSIL, a London-based broker-dealer subsidiary, is subject to the capital requirements of the Financial Services Authority, and MSJS, a Tokyo-based broker-dealer subsidiary, is subject to the capital requirements of the Financial
Services Agency. MSIL and MSJS have consistently operated in excess of their respective regulatory capital requirements.

In fiscal 2007, the Company intends to merge MSDWI into MS&Co. Upon completion of the merger, the surviving entity, MS&Co., will be the Company’s principal
U.S. broker-dealer.

Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) and other bank regulatory agencies, FDIC-insured financial institutions must maintain (a) 3% to 5% of Tier 1 capital, as defined, to average assets (“leverage ratio”),
(b) 4% of Tier 1 capital, as defined, to risk-weighted assets (“Tier 1 risk-weighted capital ratio”) and (c) 8% of total capital, as defined, to risk-weighted assets (“total risk-weighted capital ratio”). At
November 30, 2006, the leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk-weighted capital ratio and total risk-weighted capital ratio of each of the Company’s FDIC-insured financial institutions exceeded these regulatory minimums.

Certain other U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries are subject to various securities, commodities
and banking regulations, and capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate. These subsidiaries have consistently operated in excess of their local capital adequacy
requirements. Morgan Stanley Derivative Products Inc., the Company’s triple-A rated derivative products subsidiary, maintains certain operating restrictions that have been reviewed by various rating agencies.

Effective December 1, 2005, the Company became a consolidated supervised entity
(“CSE”) as defined by the SEC. As such, the Company is subject to group-wide supervision and examination by the SEC and to minimum capital requirements on a consolidated basis. As of November 30, 2006, the Company was in compliance
with the CSE capital requirements.

MS&Co. is required to hold tentative
net capital in excess of $1 billion and net capital in excess of $500 million in accordance with the market and credit risk standards of Appendix E of Rule 15c3-1. MS&Co. is also required to notify the SEC in the event that its tentative
net capital is less than $5 billion. As of November 30, 2006, MS&Co. had tentative net capital in excess of the minimum and the notification requirements.



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The regulatory capital requirements referred to above, and certain covenants contained in various agreements
governing indebtedness of the Company, may restrict the Company’s ability to withdraw capital from its subsidiaries. At November 30, 2006, approximately $14.0 billion of net assets of consolidated subsidiaries may be restricted as to the
payment of cash dividends and advances to the Company.

Cumulative
Translation Adjustments.

Cumulative translation adjustments include gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements from their respective functional currencies to U.S. dollars, net of
hedge gains or losses and related tax effects. The Company uses foreign currency contracts and designates certain non-U.S. dollar currency debt as hedges to manage the currency exposure relating to its net monetary investments in non-U.S. dollar
functional currency subsidiaries. Increases or decreases in the value of the Company’s net foreign investments generally are tax deferred for U.S. purposes, but the related hedge gains and losses are taxable currently. The Company attempts to
protect its net book value from the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its net monetary investments in non-U.S. dollar subsidiaries by selling the appropriate non-U.S. dollar currency in the forward market. However, under some
circumstances, the Company may elect not to hedge its net monetary investments in certain foreign operations due to market conditions, including the availability of various currency contracts at acceptable costs. Information relating to the hedging
of the Company’s net monetary investments in non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries and their effects on cumulative translation adjustments is summarized below:

14.    Employee
Compensation Plans.

As of December 1, 2004, the Company early
adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method (see Note 2). SFAS No. 123R requires measurement of compensation cost for equity-based awards at fair value and recognition of compensation cost over the service period, net of
estimated forfeitures. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of units granted and the grant date fair value of the Company’s common stock. The fair value of stock options is determined using the
Black-Scholes valuation model.

The components of the Company’s
stock-based compensation expense (net of cancellations and a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal 2005 associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R) are presented below:

(1)

Amounts for fiscal 2006 include $464 million of accrued stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2006 year-end equity awards granted to retirement-eligible employees in December
2006.



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The tax benefit for stock-based compensation expense related to deferred stock and stock options was $748 million,
$260 million and $250 million for fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively.

At November 30, 2006, the Company had approximately $1,188 million of compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards not yet recognized (excluding fiscal 2006 year-end awards granted in December 2006 to
non-retirement-eligible employees, which will begin to be amortized in fiscal 2007). The unrecognized compensation cost as of November 30, 2006 will primarily be recognized in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008.

In connection with awards under its equity-based compensation and benefit plans, the Company
is authorized to issue shares of its common stock held in treasury or newly issued shares. At November 30, 2006, approximately 107 million shares were available for future grant under these plans.

Deferred Stock Awards.

The Company has made deferred
stock awards pursuant to several equity-based compensation plans. The plans provide for the deferral of a portion of certain key employees’ discretionary compensation with awards made in the form of restricted common stock or in the right to
receive unrestricted shares of common stock in the future (“restricted stock units”). Awards under these plans are generally subject to vesting over time and to restrictions on sale, transfer or assignment until the end of a specified
period, generally five years from date of grant. All or a portion of an award may be canceled if employment is terminated before the end of the relevant vesting period. All or a portion of a vested award also may be canceled in certain limited
situations, including termination for cause during the relevant restriction period.

The following table sets forth activity relating to the Company’s vested and unvested restricted stock units (share data in millions):

The weighted average price of
restricted stock units at the beginning and end of fiscal 2006 was $51.47 and $53.57, respectively. During fiscal 2006, the weighted average price for granted, converted and canceled restricted stock units was $57.86, $56.41 and $54.10,
respectively. The weighted average price for restricted stock units granted during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 was $53.10 and $54.69, respectively.

The total fair value of restricted stock units converted to common stock during fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 was $768 million, $986 million and $791 million,
respectively.

The following table sets forth activity relating to the Company’s unvested restricted stock units (share data in
millions):

(1)

Unvested restricted stock units represent awards where recipients have yet to satisfy either the explicit vesting terms or retirement-eligible requirements.

Stock Option Awards.

The
Company has made stock option awards pursuant to several equity-based compensation plans. The plans provide for the deferral of a portion of certain key employees’ discretionary compensation with awards made in the form of stock options
generally having an exercise price not less than the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Such stock option awards generally become exercisable over a one- to five-year period and expire 10 years from the date of
grant, subject to accelerated expiration upon termination of employment. Stock option awards have vesting, restriction and cancellation provisions that are similar to those in deferred stock awards.

The weighted average fair values of options granted during fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and
fiscal 2004 were $14.15, $12.77 and $16.67, respectively, utilizing the following weighted average assumptions:

The Company’s expected option
life has been determined based upon historical experience, and the expected stock price volatility has been determined based upon historical stock price data over a similar time period of the expected option life.

As of November 30,
2006, the intrinsic value of in-the-money exercisable stock options was $2,292 million.

The following table presents information relating to the Company’s stock options outstanding at November 30, 2006 (number of options outstanding data in millions):

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan.

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) allows employees to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a 15% discount from market value. The Company expenses the 15% discount associated
with the ESPP.

Morgan Stanley 401(k) and Profit Sharing
Awards.

Eligible U.S. employees receive 401(k) matching contributions which are invested in the Company’s common stock. The Company also provides discretionary profit sharing to certain employees. The pre-tax
expense associated with the 401(k) match and profit sharing for fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 was $132 million, $132 million and $118 million, respectively.

15.    Employee Benefit Plans.

The Company sponsors various pension plans for the majority of its U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The Company provides certain other
postretirement benefits, primarily health care and life insurance, to eligible U.S. employees. The Company also provides certain other postemployment benefits other than pension and postretirement benefits to certain former employees or inactive
employees prior to retirement. The following summarizes these plans:

Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.

Substantially all of the U.S. employees of the Company and its U.S. affiliates are covered by a non-contributory pension plan that is qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Qualified Plan”). Unfunded supplementary plans (the “Supplemental Plans”) cover certain executives. In addition, certain of the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries have
pension plans covering substantially all of their employees. These pension plans generally provide pension benefits that are based on each employee’s years of credited service and on compensation levels specified in the plans. The
Company’s policy is to fund at least the amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax regulations. Liabilities for benefits payable under its Supplemental Plans are accrued by the Company and
are funded when paid to the beneficiaries.



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company also has unfunded postretirement benefit plans that provide medical and life insurance for eligible U.S.
retirees and their dependents.

The Company uses a measurement date of
September 30 to calculate obligations under its pension and postretirement plans.

fiscal 2005 as well as a summary of the funded status at November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005:

The accumulated benefit obligation for
all defined benefit pension plans was $2,385 million and $2,351 million at November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005, respectively.

The following table contains
information for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of plan assets as of fiscal year-end:

In accordance with SFAS No. 87,
“Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,” the Company has recognized an additional minimum pension liability of $13 million at November 30, 2006 and $18 million at November 30, 2005 for defined benefit pension plans whose
accumulated benefit obligations exceeded plan assets. An intangible asset of $1 million was recognized as of November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005, which represented the unrecognized prior-service cost for such plans. The remaining balance of $12
million ($7 million, net of income taxes) in fiscal 2006 and $17 million ($5 million, net of income taxes) in fiscal 2005 was recorded as a reduction of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of Shareholders’ equity.

Assumptions.

The following table presents the weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit
obligations at fiscal year-end:

The following table presents the
weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs for fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004:

The expected long-term rate of return
on assets represents the Company’s best estimate of the long-term return on plan assets and generally was estimated by computing a weighted average return of the underlying long-term expected returns on the different asset classes, based on the
target asset allocations. For plans where there is no established target asset allocation, actual asset allocations were used. The expected long-term return on assets is a long-term assumption that generally is expected to remain the same from one
year to the next, but is adjusted when there is a significant change in the target asset allocation, the fees and expenses paid by the plan or market conditions.



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following table presents assumed health care cost trend rates used to determine the postretirement benefit
obligations at fiscal year-end:

Assumed health care cost trend rates
can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the Company’s postretirement benefit plans. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

Qualified Plan Assets.

The Qualified Plan assets represent 89% of the Company’s total
pension plan assets. The weighted average asset allocations for the Qualified Plan at November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005 and the targeted asset allocation for fiscal 2007 by asset class were as follows:

Qualified Pension Plan Asset
Allocation

.    The Company, in consultation with its independent investment consultants and actuaries, determined the asset allocation targets for its Qualified Plan based on its assessment of business and financial
conditions, demographic and actuarial data, funding characteristics and related risk factors. Other relevant factors, including industry practices, long-term historical and prospective capital market returns, were considered as well.

The Qualified Plan return objectives provide long-term measures for monitoring the investment
performance against growth in the pension obligations. The overall allocation is expected to help protect the plan’s funded status while generating sufficiently stable real returns (net of inflation) to help cover current and future benefit
payments. Total Qualified Plan portfolio performance is assessed by comparing actual returns with relevant benchmarks, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the Russell 2000 Index, the MSCI EAFE Index and, in the case of the fixed income
portfolio, the Qualified Plan’s liability profile.

Both the equity and
fixed income portions of the asset allocation use a combination of active and passive investment strategies and different investment styles. The fixed income asset allocation consists of longer-



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

duration fixed income securities in order to help reduce plan exposure to interest rate variation and to better correlate assets with obligations. The
longer-duration fixed income allocation is expected to help stabilize plan contributions over the long run.

The asset mix of the Company’s Qualified Plan is reviewed by the Morgan Stanley Retirement Plan Investment Committee on a regular basis. When asset class exposure reaches a minimum or maximum level, an asset
allocation review process is initiated, and the portfolio is automatically rebalanced back to target allocation levels unless the Investment Committee determines otherwise.

The Investment Committee has determined to allocate no more than 10% of the Qualified Plan assets to “alternative” asset classes
that provide attractive diversification benefits, absolute return enhancement and/or other potential benefit to the plan. Allocations to alternative asset classes will be made based upon an evaluation of particular attributes and relevant
considerations of each asset class.

Derivative instruments are permitted in
the Qualified Plan’s portfolio only to the extent that they comply with all of its policy guidelines and are consistent with its risk and return objectives. In addition, any investment in derivatives must meet the following conditions:

•

Derivatives may be used only if the vehicle is deemed by the investment manager to be more attractive than a similar direct investment in the underlying cash market
or if the vehicle is being used to manage risk of the portfolio.

•

Under no circumstances may derivatives be used in a speculative manner or to leverage the portfolio.

•

Derivatives may not be used as short-term trading vehicles. The investment philosophy of the Qualified Plan is that investment activity is undertaken for long-term
investment rather than short-term trading.

•

Derivatives may be used only in the management of the Qualified Plan’s portfolio when their possible effects can be quantified, shown to enhance the
risk-return profile of the portfolio, and reported in a meaningful and understandable manner.

As a fundamental operating principle, any restrictions on the underlying assets apply to a respective derivative product. This includes percentage allocations and credit
quality. The purpose of the use of derivatives is to enhance investment in the underlying assets, not to circumvent portfolio restrictions.

Cash Flows.

The Company expects to contribute approximately $140 million to its pension and postretirement benefit plans (U.S. and non-U.S.) in fiscal 2007 based upon their current funded status and expected asset return
assumptions for fiscal 2007, as applicable.

Expected benefit payments
associated with the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans for the next five fiscal years and in aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter are as follows:



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Defined Contribution Pension Plans.

The Company maintains separate defined contribution pension plans that cover substantially all employees of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries.
Under such plans, benefits are determined by the purchasing power of the accumulated value of contributions paid. In fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, the Company’s expense related to these plans was $91 million, $73 million and $58
million, respectively.

Postemployment
Benefits.

Postemployment benefits include, but are not limited to, salary continuation, severance benefits, disability-related benefits, and continuation of health care and life insurance coverage provided to former
employees or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. The postemployment benefit obligations were not material as of November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005.

16.    Income Taxes.

The provision for income taxes from continuing operations consisted of:

The following table reconciles the
provision for income taxes to the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate:

(1)

The fiscal 2006 effective tax rate includes the impact of a $280 million income tax benefit related to the resolution of the Internal Revenue Service examination of years 1994-1998.
The fiscal 2005 effective tax rate includes the impact of a $309 million income tax benefit resulting from repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

As of November 30, 2006, the Company had approximately $4.4 billion of earnings
attributable to foreign subsidiaries for which no provisions have been recorded for income tax that could occur upon repatriation. Except to the extent such earnings can be repatriated tax efficiently, they are permanently invested abroad. It is not
practicable to determine the amount of income taxes payable in the event all such foreign earnings are repatriated.



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The American Jobs Creation Act, adopted on October 22, 2004, provided for a special one-time tax deduction, or
dividend received deduction, of 85% of qualifying foreign earnings that are repatriated in either a company’s last tax year that began before the enactment date or the first tax year that begins during the one-year period beginning on the
enactment date. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $309 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, resulting from the Company’s repatriation of approximately $4.0 billion of qualifying foreign earnings
under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. The $309 million tax benefit resulted from the reversal of net deferred tax liabilities previously provided under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” net of
additional taxes associated with these qualifying earnings.

Deferred income
taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to
reverse. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities at November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005 were as follows:

Cash paid for income taxes was $3,115
million, $1,536 million and $818 million in fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively.

The Company recorded income tax benefits of $72 million, $317 million and $331 million related to employee stock compensation transactions in fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. Such benefits were
credited to Paid-in capital.

Income Tax
Examinations.

The Company is under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other tax authorities in certain countries, such as Japan and the U.K., and states in which the
Company has significant business operations, such as New York. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction; for example, the current IRS examination covers 1999-2005. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional
assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years’ examinations. The Company has established tax reserves that the Company believes are adequate in relation to the potential for additional
assessments. Once established, the Company adjusts tax reserves only when more information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. The Company believes that the resolution of tax matters will not have a material
effect on the consolidated financial condition of the



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Company, although a resolution could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statement of income for a particular future period and on the
Company’s effective income tax rate for any period in which such resolution occurs.

The effective income tax rate in fiscal 2006 included an income tax benefit of $280 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, related to the resolution of the IRS examination of years 1994-1998.

17.    Segment and Geographic Information.

The Company structures its segments primarily based upon the nature of the financial
products and services provided to customers and the Company’s management organization. The Company provides a wide range of financial products and services to its customers in each of its business segments: Institutional Securities, Global
Wealth Management Group, Asset Management and Discover. For further discussion of the Company’s business segments, see Note 1.

Revenues and expenses directly associated with each respective segment are included in determining their operating results. Other revenues and expenses that are not
directly attributable to a particular segment are allocated based upon the Company’s allocation methodologies, generally based on each segment’s respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.

As a result of treating certain intersegment transactions as transactions with external
parties, the Company includes an Intersegment Eliminations category to reconcile the business segment results to the Company’s consolidated results. Income before taxes in Intersegment Eliminations primarily represents the effect of timing
differences associated with the revenue and expense recognition of commissions paid by Asset Management to the Global Wealth Management Group associated with sales of certain products and the related compensation costs paid to the Global Wealth
Management Group’s global representatives.

Selected financial information

18.    Discontinued Operations.

Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005.

On August 17, 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved
management’s recommendation to sell the Company’s non-core aircraft leasing business. In connection with this action, the aircraft leasing business was classified as “held for sale” and reported as discontinued operations in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements. In addition, in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recognized a charge of approximately $1.7 billion ($1.0 billion after-tax) to reflect the write-down of the aircraft leasing business to
its estimated fair value of approximately $2.0 billion. In determining the charge that was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company estimated the value to be realized in selling the aircraft leasing business as a whole. The
estimated value of the business was based on the appraised values of the aircraft portfolio, an evaluation of then current market conditions, recent transactions involving the sales of similar aircraft leasing businesses, a detailed assessment of
the portfolio and additional valuation analyses.

On January 30, 2006, the
Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement under which it would sell its aircraft leasing business to Terra Firma, a European private equity group, for approximately $2.5 billion in cash and the assumption of liabilities. Based on
the terms of the agreement and in accordance with SFAS No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS No. 144”), the Company revised its estimate of the fair value (less selling costs) of the
aircraft leasing business and, as a result, in the fourth quarter reduced the pre-tax charge recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 by approximately $1.1 billion. Full year results for fiscal 2005 reflected a charge of $509 million ($316
million after-tax).

The sale was completed on March 24, 2006. The results
for discontinued operations in the quarter ended February 28, 2006 included a loss of $125 million ($75 million after-tax) related to the impact of the finalization of the sales proceeds and balance sheet adjustments related to the closing.

Fiscal 2004.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company entered into agreements for the sale of
certain aircraft. Accordingly, the Company designated such aircraft as “held for sale” and recorded a $42 million pre-tax loss related to the write-down of these aircraft to fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 144. As of
February 3, 2005, all of these aircraft were sold.

In accordance with
SFAS No. 144, the Company’s aircraft were reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of an aircraft may not have been recoverable. During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the
Company evaluated various financing strategies for its aircraft financing business. As part of that evaluation and to determine the potential debt ratings associated with the financing strategies, the Company commissioned appraisals of the aircraft
portfolio from three independent aircraft appraisal firms. The appraisals indicated a decrease in the aircraft portfolio average market value of 12% from the appraisals obtained at the date of the prior impairment charge (May 31, 2003). In
accordance with SFAS No. 144, the Company considered the decline in appraisal values a significant decrease in the market price of its aircraft portfolio and thus a trigger event to test for impairment in the carrying value of its aircraft.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, the Company tested each of its aircraft
for impairment by comparing each aircraft’s projected undiscounted cash flows with its respective carrying value. For those aircraft for which impairment was indicated (because the projected undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying
value), the Company adjusted the carrying value of each aircraft to its fair value if lower than the carrying value. To determine each aircraft’s fair value, the Company used the market value appraisals provided by three independent appraisers.
As a result of this review, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax asset impairment charge of $109 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 based on the average of the market value appraisals provided by the independent appraisers.

Summarized financial information for the Company’s discontinued operations:

The table below provides information regarding amounts included within discontinued
operations (dollars in millions):

Fiscal 2006 reflected a net loss of
$25 million on discontinued operations, which included the results of operations of the aircraft leasing business through the date of sale. Fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 reflected a net loss on discontinued operations of $302 million and $103 million,
respectively.

The following is a summary of the assets and liabilities of the
Company’s aircraft leasing business as of November 30, 2005 (dollars in millions):

19.    Variable
Interest Entities.

Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46, as revised (“FIN 46R”), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” applies to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling
financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties (“variable interest entities”). Variable interest entities are
required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if they do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a
majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests. The Company is involved with various entities in the normal course of business that may be deemed to be VIEs and may hold interests therein, including
debt securities, interest-only strip investments and derivative instruments that may be considered variable interests. Transactions associated with these entities include asset- and mortgage-backed securitizations and structured financings
(including collateralized debt, bond or loan obligations and credit-linked notes). The Company engages in these transactions principally to facilitate client needs and as a means of selling financial assets. The Company consolidates entities in
which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. For those entities deemed to be qualifying special purpose entities (as defined in SFAS No. 140), which includes the credit card asset securitization master trusts (see Note 5), the Company does
not consolidate the entity.

The Company purchases and sells interests in
entities that may be deemed to be VIEs in the ordinary course of its business. As a result of these activities, it is possible that such entities may be consolidated and deconsolidated at various points in time. Therefore, the Company’s
variable interests described below may not be held by the Company at the end of future quarterly reporting periods.



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

At November 30, 2006, in connection with its Institutional Securities business, the aggregate size of VIEs,
including financial asset-backed securitization, mortgage-backed securitization, collateralized debt obligation, credit-linked note, structured note, municipal bond trust, loan issuing, commodities monetization, equity-linked note, equity fund and
exchangeable trust entities, for which the Company was the primary beneficiary of the entities was approximately $20.4 billion, which is the carrying amount of the consolidated assets recorded as Financial instruments owned that are collateral for
the entities’ obligations. The nature and purpose of these entities that the Company consolidated were to issue a series of notes to investors that provides the investors a return based on the holdings of the entities. These transactions were
executed to facilitate client investment objectives. The structured note, equity-linked note, equity fund, certain credit-linked note, certain collateralized debt obligation, certain mortgage-backed securitization, certain financial asset-backed
securitization and municipal bond transactions also were executed as a means of selling financial assets. The Company consolidates those entities where it holds either the entire class or a majority of the class of subordinated notes or entered into
a derivative instrument with the VIE, which bears the majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the expected residual returns of the entities. The Company accounts for the assets held by the entities as Financial instruments owned
and the liabilities of the entities as Other secured financings. For those liabilities that include an embedded derivative, the Company has bifurcated such derivative in accordance with SFAS No. 133. The beneficial interests of these
consolidated entities are payable solely from the cash flows of the assets held by the VIE.

At November 30, 2006, also in connection with its Institutional Securities business, the aggregate size of the entities for which the Company holds significant variable interests, which consist of subordinated
and other classes of beneficial interests, derivative instruments, limited partnership investments and secondary guarantees, was approximately $34.7 billion. The Company’s variable interests associated with these entities, primarily
credit-linked note, structured note, loan and bond issuing, collateralized debt, loan and bond obligation, financial asset-backed securitization, mortgage-backed securitization and tax credit limited liability entities, including investments in
affordable housing tax credit funds and underlying synthetic fuel production plants, were approximately $19.0 billion consisting primarily of senior beneficial interests, which represent the Company’s maximum exposure to loss at
November 30, 2006. The Company may hedge the risks inherent in its variable interest holdings, thereby reducing its exposure to loss. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss does not include the offsetting benefit of any financial
instruments that the Company utilizes to hedge these risks.

20.    Guarantees.

The Company has
certain obligations under certain guarantee arrangements, including contracts and indemnification agreements that contingently require a guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying measure (such as an
interest or foreign exchange rate, security or commodity price, an index or the occurrence or non-occurrence of a specified event) related to an asset, liability or equity security of a guaranteed party. Also included as guarantees are contracts
that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entity’s failure to perform under an agreement, as well as indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others. The Company’s use of guarantees
is disclosed below by type of guarantee:

Derivative
Contracts.

Certain derivative contracts meet the accounting definition of a guarantee, including certain written options, contingent forward contracts and credit default swaps. Although the Company’s derivative
arrangements do not specifically identify whether the derivative counterparty retains the underlying asset, liability or equity security, the Company has disclosed information regarding all derivative contracts that could meet the accounting
definition of a guarantee. The maximum potential payout for certain derivative contracts, such as written interest rate caps and written foreign currency options, cannot be estimated, as



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

increases in interest or foreign exchange rates in the future could possibly be unlimited. Therefore, in order to provide information regarding the maximum
potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under certain derivative contracts, the notional amount of the contracts has been disclosed.

The Company records all derivative contracts at fair value. For this reason, the Company does not monitor its risk exposure to such
derivative contracts based on derivative notional amounts; rather, the Company manages its risk exposure on a fair value basis. Aggregate market risk limits have been established, and market risk measures are routinely monitored against these
limits. The Company also manages its exposure to these derivative contracts through a variety of risk mitigation strategies, including, but not limited to, entering into offsetting economic hedge positions. The Company believes that the notional
amounts of the derivative contracts generally overstate its exposure.

Financial Guarantees to Third Parties.

In connection with its corporate lending business and other corporate activities, the Company provides standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees to
counterparties. Such arrangements represent obligations to make payments to third parties if the counterparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a borrowing arrangement or other contractual obligation.

Market Value Guarantees.

Market value guarantees are
issued to guarantee return of principal invested to fund investors associated with certain European equity funds and to guarantee timely payment of a specified return to investors in certain affordable housing tax credit funds. The guarantees
associated with certain European equity funds are designed to provide for any shortfall between the market value of the underlying fund assets and invested principal and a stipulated return amount. The guarantees provided to investors in certain
affordable housing tax credit funds are designed to return an investor’s contribution to a fund and the investor’s share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by a fund.

Liquidity Guarantees.

The Company has entered into
liquidity facilities with special purpose entities and other counterparties, whereby the Company is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. The Company often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the special
purpose entities in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities.

The table below summarizes certain information regarding these guarantees at November 30, 2006:

Indemnities.

In the normal course of its business, the Company provides standard indemnities to counterparties for certain contingent exposures and taxes, including U.S. and foreign withholding taxes, on
interest and other payments made on derivatives, securities and stock lending transactions, certain annuity products and other financial arrangements. These indemnity payments could be required based on a change in the tax laws or change in
interpretation of applicable tax rulings or a change in factual circumstances. Certain contracts contain provisions that enable the Company to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of such events. The



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these indemnifications cannot be estimated. The Company has not
recorded any contingent liability in the consolidated financial statements for these indemnifications and believes that the occurrence of any events that would trigger payments under these contracts is remote.

Exchange/Clearinghouse Member Guarantees.

The Company is
a member of various U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges and clearinghouses that trade and clear securities and/or futures contracts. Associated with its membership, the Company may be required to pay a proportionate share of the financial obligations of
another member who may default on its obligations to the exchange or the clearinghouse. While the rules governing different exchange or clearinghouse memberships vary, in general the Company’s guarantee obligations would arise only if the
exchange or clearinghouse had previously exhausted its resources. In addition, any such guarantee obligation would be apportioned among the other non-defaulting members of the exchange or clearinghouse. Any potential contingent liability under these
membership agreements cannot be estimated. The Company has not recorded any contingent liability in the consolidated financial statements for these agreements and believes that any potential requirement to make payments under these agreements is
remote.

General Partner Guarantees.

As a
general partner in certain private equity and real estate partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all
or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in various partnership agreements, subject to certain limitations. The maximum potential amount of future
payments that the Company could be required to make under these provisions at November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005 was $320 million and $349 million, respectively. As of November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005, the
Company’s accrued liability for distributions that the Company has determined is probable it will be required to refund based on the applicable refund criteria specified in the various partnership agreements was $25 million and $36 million,
respectively.

Securitized Asset
Guarantees.

As part of the Company’s Institutional Securities and Discover securitization activities, the Company provides representations and warranties that certain securitized assets conform to specified
guidelines. The Company may be required to repurchase such assets or indemnify the purchaser against losses if the assets do not meet certain conforming guidelines. Due diligence is performed by the Company to ensure that asset guideline
qualifications are met, and, to the extent the Company has acquired such assets to be securitized from other parties, the Company seeks to obtain its own representations and warranties regarding the assets. The maximum potential amount of future
payments the Company could be required to make would be equal to the current outstanding balances of all assets subject to such securitization activities. Also, in connection with originations of residential mortgage loans under the Company’s
FlexSource

®

program, the Company may permit
borrowers to pledge marketable securities as collateral instead of requiring cash down payments for the purchase of the underlying residential property. Upon sale of the residential mortgage loans, the Company may provide a surety bond that
reimburses the purchasers for shortfalls in the borrowers’ securities accounts up to certain limits if the collateral maintained in the securities accounts (along with the associated real estate collateral) is insufficient to cover losses that
purchasers experience as a result of defaults by borrowers on the underlying residential mortgage loans. The Company requires the borrowers to meet daily collateral calls to ensure the marketable securities pledged in lieu of a cash down payment are
sufficient. At November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005, the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company may be required to make under its surety bond was $121 million and $157 million, respectively. The Company has not recorded
any contingent liability in the consolidated financial statements for these representations and warranties and reimbursement agreements and believes that the probability of any payments under these arrangements is remote.

Merchant Chargeback Guarantees.

In connection with its
Discover business, the Company issues credit cards in the U.S. and U.K. and owns and operates the Discover Network in the U.S. The Company is contingently



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

liable for certain transactions processed on the Discover Network in the event of a dispute between the cardmember and a merchant. The contingent liability
arises if the disputed transaction involves a merchant or merchant acquirer with whom the Discover Network has a direct relationship. If a dispute is resolved in the cardmember’s favor, the Discover Network will credit or refund the disputed
amount to the Discover Network card issuer, who in turn credits its cardmember’s account. Discover Network will then charge back the transaction to the merchant or merchant acquirer. If the Discover Network is unable to collect the amount from
the merchant or merchant acquirer, it will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardmember. In most instances, a payment requirement by the Discover Network is unlikely to arise because most products or services are delivered
when purchased, and credits are issued by the merchant acquirer or merchant on returned items in a timely fashion. However, where the product or service is not provided until some later date following the purchase, the likelihood of payment by the
Discover Network increases. Similarly, the Company is also contingently liable for the resolution of cardmember disputes associated with its general purpose credit cards issued by its U.K. chartered bank on the MasterCard and Visa networks. The
maximum potential amount of future payments related to these contingent liabilities is estimated to be the total Discover Network sales transaction volume processed to date as well as the total U.K. cardmember sales transaction volume billed to date
that could qualify as a valid disputed transaction under the Company’s merchant processing network, issuer and cardmember agreements; however, the Company believes that this amount is not representative of the Company’s actual potential
loss exposure based on the Company’s historical experience. The actual amount of the potential exposure cannot be quantified as the Company cannot determine whether the current or cumulative transaction volumes may include or result in disputed
transactions.

The table below summarizes certain information regarding
merchant chargeback guarantees during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005:

The amount of the liability related to
the Company’s cardmember merchant guarantee was not material at November 30, 2006. The Company mitigates this risk by withholding settlement from merchants or obtaining escrow deposits from certain merchants that are considered higher risk
due to various factors such as time delays in the delivery of products or services. The table below provides information regarding the settlement withholdings and escrow deposits:

Other.

The Company may, from time to time, in its role as investment banking advisor be required to provide guarantees in connection with certain European merger and acquisition transactions. If required
by the regulating authorities, the Company provides a guarantee that the acquirer in the merger and acquisition transaction has or will have sufficient funds to complete the transaction and would then be required to make the acquisition payments in
the event the acquirer’s funds are insufficient at the completion date of the transaction. These arrangements generally cover the time frame from the transaction offer date to its closing date and therefore are generally short term in nature.
The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make cannot be estimated. The Company believes the likelihood of any payment by the Company under these arrangements is remote given the level of the
Company’s due diligence associated with its role as investment banking advisor.

21.    Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The majority of the Company’s assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value or at
amounts that approximate fair value. Such assets and liabilities include: cash and cash equivalents, cash and securities deposited with clearing organizations or segregated under federal and other regulations or requirements, customer and broker
receivables and payables, certain other assets, commercial paper, and other short-term borrowings and payables.

The fair value of certain of the Company’s other assets and liabilities is presented below.

Financial Instruments Owned and Financial Instruments Sold, Not Yet Purchased.

The Company’s
financial instruments used for trading and investment and for asset and liability management are recorded at fair value as discussed in Note 2.

Consumer Loans.

The fair value of consumer loans is determined by discounting cash flows using current market rates of loans having
similar characteristics. The cash flow calculation methodologies, which vary by product, include adjustments for credit risk and prepayment rates commensurate with recent and projected trends. At November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005,
the carrying value of the Company’s consumer loans was approximately $0.1 billion less than their estimated fair value.

Collateralized Transaction Activities.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell, Securities borrowed, Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase and Securities loaned are recorded at their original contract amount plus accrued interest. As the majority of such activities are short term in nature, the carrying value of these instruments approximates fair value.

Deposits.

The estimated fair value of the
Company’s deposits, using current rates for deposits with similar remaining maturities, approximated carrying value at November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005.

Long-Term Borrowings.

The Company’s long-term borrowings are recorded at historical amounts unless
designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge under SFAS No. 133. The fair value of the Company’s long-term borrowings was estimated using either quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analyses based on the Company’s current
borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. At November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005, the carrying value of the Company’s long-term borrowings was approximately $1.8 billion and approximately $0.9 billion,
respectively, less than fair value.

22.    Investments
in Unconsolidated Investees.

The Company invests in unconsolidated
investees that own synthetic fuel production plants. The Company accounts for these investments under the equity method of accounting. The Company’s share of the operating losses generated by these investments is recorded within Losses from
unconsolidated investees, and the tax credits and the tax benefits associated with these operating losses are recorded within the Provision for income taxes.

In fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, the losses from unconsolidated investees were more than offset by the respective tax credits and tax benefits on the losses.
The table below provides information regarding the losses from unconsolidated investees, tax credits and tax benefits on the losses:



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Under the current tax law, synthetic fuels tax credits are granted under Section 45K of the Internal Revenue
Code. Synthetic fuels tax credits are available in full only when the price of oil is less than a base price specified by the tax code, as adjusted for inflation (“Base Price”). The Base Price for each calendar year is determined by the
Secretary of the Treasury by April 1 of the following year. If the annual average price of a barrel of oil in 2006 or future years exceeds the applicable Base Price, the synthetic fuels tax credits generated by the Company’s synthetic fuel
facilities will be phased out, on a ratable basis, over the phase-out range. Synthetic fuels tax credits realized in prior years are not affected by this limitation. Due to the high level of crude oil prices in fiscal 2006 and continued uncertainty
regarding the value of tax credits associated with synthetic fuel investments, all of the Company’s investees idled production at their synthetic fuel production facilities during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2006. In the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2006, all of the Company’s investees began production at their synthetic fuel production facilities, largely due to a decline in the level of crude oil prices in the fourth quarter as compared with the second and third
quarters of fiscal 2006. Additionally, based on fiscal year to date and futures prices at November 30, 2006, the Company estimates that there will be a partial phase-out of tax credits earned in fiscal 2006. The impact of this anticipated
partial phase-out is included within Losses from unconsolidated investees and the Provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2006.

The Company has entered into derivative contracts designed to reduce its exposure to rising oil prices and the potential phase-out of the synthetic fuels tax credits.
Changes in fair value relative to these derivative contracts are included within Principal transactions—trading revenues.

23.    Business and Other Acquisitions and Dispositions.

Subsequent to Fiscal 2006.

Fiscal 2006.

Goldfish

.

On February 17, 2006, the Company acquired the Goldfish credit card business in the U.K. The acquisition has
added economies of scale through better utilization of the existing U.K. infrastructure and strengthened the Company’s position in the U.K. credit card market. Since the acquisition date, the results of Goldfish have been included within the
Discover business segment. The acquisition price was $1,676 million, which was paid in cash in February 2006. The Company recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately $370 million in connection with the acquisition.

The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed at the date of the acquisition:

On October 30, 2006, the
Company formed a strategic alliance with Avenue Capital Group (“Avenue”), a New York-based investment manager with approximately $12 billion in assets under management. The Company acquired a minority interest in Avenue. The investment in
Avenue is accounted for under the equity method of accounting within the Asset Management business segment.

Nan Tung Bank.

On September 29, 2006, the Company acquired Nan Tung Bank Ltd. Zhuhai (“Nan Tung”), a bank in the People’s Republic of China. The acquisition
will enable the Company to strengthen its platform in China. Since the acquisition date, the results of Nan Tung have been included within the Institutional Securities business segment. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and subject
to further adjustment as the valuation of certain intangible assets is still in process.

TransMontaigne Inc.

On September 1, 2006, the Company acquired TransMontaigne Inc. and its affiliates (“TransMontaigne”), a group of companies operating in
the refined petroleum products marketing and distribution business. The acquisition will enable the Company to expand its supply and distribution of oil and refined oil products across a broader range of clients and regions across the U.S., as well
as increase its oil storage capacity across the U.S. Since the acquisition date, the results of TransMontaigne and its affiliates have been included within the Institutional Securities business segment. The allocation of the purchase price is
preliminary and is subject to further adjustment as the valuation of certain intangible assets is still in process.

Heidmar
Group.

On September 1, 2006, the Company acquired the Heidmar Group of companies that provides international shipping and U.S. marine logistics services. The acquisition will enable the Company to expand
its physical freight business across multiple vessel classes and geographies and provides an opportunity to expand into international shipping and services. Since the acquisition date, the results of the Heidmar Group of companies have been included
within the Institutional Securities business segment. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and subject to further adjustment as the valuation of certain intangible assets is still in process.

Office Building.

On June 19, 2006, the Company
purchased a majority interest in a joint venture that indirectly owns title to 522 Fifth Avenue, a 23-floor office building in New York City (the “Building”), for approximately $420 million. Concurrently, the Company entered into an
occupancy agreement with the joint venture pursuant to which the Company will occupy the office space in the Building (approximately 580,000 square feet).

The pro forma impact of each of the above business acquisitions individually and in the aggregate was not material to the consolidated financial statements.

Fiscal 2005.

PULSE.

On January 12, 2005, the Company acquired PULSE, a U.S.-based automated teller
machine/debit and electronic funds transfer network currently serving banks, credit unions, and savings and other financial institutions. Since the acquisition date, the results of PULSE have been included within the Discover business segment. The
acquisition price was approximately $324 million, which was paid in cash during fiscal 2005. The Company recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of $329 million in connection with the acquisition.

Fiscal 2004.

Barra.

On June 3, 2004, the Company acquired Barra, Inc. (“Barra”), a global leader in
delivering risk management systems and services to managers of portfolio and firm-wide investment risk. Since the acquisition date, the results of Barra have been included within the Institutional Securities business segment. The acquisition price
was $41.00 per share in cash, or an aggregate consideration of approximately $800 million. The Company recorded goodwill and other intangible assets totaling $663 million in connection with the acquisition. In February 2005, the Company sold its 50%
interest in POSIT, an equity crossing system that matches institutional buyers and sellers, to Investment Technology Group, Inc. The Company acquired the POSIT interest as part of its acquisition of Barra. As a result of the sale, the net carrying
amount of intangible assets decreased by approximately $75 million.

24.    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108.

In September 2006, the SEC released SAB 108. SAB 108 permits the Company to adjust for the cumulative effect of errors relating to prior years in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the current fiscal
year, with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. SAB 108 also requires the adjustment of any prior quarterly financial statements within the fiscal year of adoption for the effects of such
errors on the quarters when the information is next presented. Such adjustments do not require previously filed reports with the SEC to be amended. Effective August 31, 2006, the Company elected early application of SAB 108. In accordance
with SAB 108, the Company has adjusted its opening retained earnings for fiscal 2006 and its financial results for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006 for the items described below. The Company considers these adjustments to be immaterial to prior
annual periods.

Trust Preferred
Securities.

The Company adjusted its opening retained earnings for fiscal 2006 and its financial results for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006 to reflect a change in its hedge accounting under SFAS



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

No. 133. The change is being made following a clarification by the SEC of its interpretation of SFAS No. 133 related to the accounting for fair
value hedges of fixed-rate trust preferred securities.

Since January 2005, the
Company entered into various interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in its trust preferred securities. The terms of the interest rate swaps and the corresponding trust preferred securities mirrored one another, and the Company
determined in the past that the changes in the fair value of the swaps and hedged instruments were the same. The Company applied the commonly used “short-cut method” in accounting for these fair value hedges and, therefore, did not reflect
any gains or losses during the relevant periods. Based upon the SEC’s clarification of SFAS No. 133, the Company determined that since it has the ability at its election to defer interest payments on its trust preferred securities, these
swaps did not qualify for the short-cut method. These swaps performed as expected as effective economic hedges of interest rate risk. The Company ended hedging of the interest rate risk on these trust preferred securities effective August 2006 and
adjusted its financial results as if hedge accounting was never applied. Prospectively, the Company will manage the interest rate risk on these securities as part of its overall asset liability management.

Compensation and Benefits.

The Company also adjusted its
opening retained earnings for fiscal 2006 and its financial results for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006 for two compensation and benefits accruals. Such accruals are related to (i) the overaccrual of certain payroll taxes in certain
non-U.S. locations, primarily in the U.K., which arose in fiscal 2000 through fiscal 2006 and (ii) an adjustment to the amortization expense associated with stock-based compensation awards, which arose in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004.

Impact of Adjustments.

The impact of each
of the items noted above on fiscal 2006 opening Shareholders’ equity and Retained earnings and on Net income for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2006 is presented below (dollars in millions):

The aggregate impact of these
adjustments is summarized below (dollars in millions, except per share data):

25.    Insurance Settlement.

On
September 11, 2001, the U.S. experienced terrorist attacks targeted against New York City and Washington, D.C. The attacks in New York resulted in the destruction of the World Trade Center complex, where approximately 3,700 of the
Company’s employees were located, and the temporary closing of the debt and equity financial markets in the U.S. Through the implementation of its business recovery plans, the Company relocated its displaced employees to other facilities.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company settled its claim with its
insurance carriers related to the events of September 11, 2001. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $251 million as the insurance recovery was in excess of previously recognized costs related to the terrorist attacks (primarily write-offs of
leasehold improvements and destroyed technology and telecommunications equipment in the World Trade Center complex, employee relocation and certain other employee-related expenditures).

The pre-tax gain was recorded as a reduction to non-interest expenses and is included within the Global Wealth Management Group ($198
million), Asset Management ($43 million) and Institutional Securities ($10 million) business segments. The insurance settlement was allocated to the respective segments in accordance with the relative damages sustained by each segment.

26.    Lease Adjustment.

Prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company did not record the effects of
scheduled rent increases and rent-free periods for certain real estate leases on a straight-line basis. In addition, the Company had been accounting for certain tenant improvement allowances as reductions to the related leasehold improvements
instead of recording funds received as deferred rent and amortizing them as reductions to lease expense over the lease term. In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company changed its method of accounting for these rent escalation clauses,
rent-free periods and tenant improvement allowances to properly reflect lease expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. The impact of this correction resulted in the Company recording



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

$109 million of additional rent expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The impact of this change was included within non-interest expenses and
reduced income before taxes within the Institutional Securities ($71 million), Global Wealth Management Group ($29 million), Asset Management ($5 million) and Discover ($4 million) business segments. The impact of this correction was not material to
the pre-tax income of each of the segments or to the Company.

27.    Asset Management and Account Fees.

Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company was improperly recognizing certain management fees, account fees and related compensation expense paid at the beginning of the relevant contract periods, which is when such fees were
billed. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company changed its method of accounting for such fees to properly recognize such fees and related expenses over the relevant contract period, generally quarterly or annually. As a result of the
change, the Company’s results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 included an adjustment to reflect the cumulative impact of the deferral of certain management fees, account fees and related compensation expense paid to global representatives.
The impact of this change reduced net revenues by $107 million, non-interest expenses by $27 million and income before taxes by $80 million, at both the Company and the Global Wealth Management Group business segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004. Such adjustment reduced fiscal 2004 net income by approximately $50 million and basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.05.

28.    Accounting Developments.

In April 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FIN 46(R)-6, “Determining the Variability to Be Considered in Applying FASB Interpretation
No. 46(R)” (“FSP FIN 46(R)-6”). FSP FIN 46(R)-6 requires that the determination of the variability to be considered in applying FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” (“FIN 46R”), be based on an analysis of the design of the entity. In evaluating whether an interest with a variable interest entity creates or absorbs variability, FSP FIN 46(R)-6 focuses on the role of a
contract or arrangement in the design of an entity, regardless of its legal form or accounting classification. The Company adopted the guidance in FSP FIN 46(R)-6 prospectively on September 1, 2006 to all entities that the
Company first becomes involved with and to all entities previously required to be analyzed under FIN 46R when a reconsideration event has occurred under paragraph 7 of FIN 46R. The adoption of FSP FIN 46(R)-6 did not have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in EITF Issue No. 04-5, “Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited
Partners Have Certain Rights” (“EITF Issue No. 04-5”). Under the provisions of EITF Issue No. 04-5, a general partner in a limited partnership is presumed to control that limited partnership and, therefore, should include
the limited partnership in its consolidated financial statements, regardless of the amount or extent of the general partner’s interest unless a majority of the limited partners can vote to dissolve or liquidate the partnership or otherwise
remove the general partner without having to show cause or the limited partners have substantive participating rights that can overcome the presumption of control by the general partner. EITF Issue No. 04-5 was effective immediately for all
newly formed limited partnerships and existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements have been modified. For all other existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements have not been modified, the Company adopted
EITF Issue No. 04-5 on December 1, 2006. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 04-5 on December 1, 2006 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid
Financial Instruments” (“SFAS No. 155”), which amends SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140. SFAS No. 155 permits hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation to
irrevocably be



MORGAN STANLEY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of income. The fair value election may be applied on an
instrument-by-instrument basis. SFAS No. 155 also eliminates a restriction on the passive derivative instruments that a qualifying special purpose entity may hold. The Company adopted SFAS No. 155 on December 1, 2006 and has elected
to fair value only certain hybrid financial instruments acquired, issued or subject to a remeasurement event after December 1, 2006.

In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140” (“SFAS No.
156”). SFAS No. 156 requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. The standard permits an entity to subsequently measure each class of servicing assets
or servicing liabilities at fair value and report changes in fair value in the statement of income in the period in which the changes occur. The Company adopted SFAS No. 156 on December 1, 2006 and has elected to fair value certain
servicing rights held as of the date of adoption. This election did not have a material impact on the Company’s opening balance of Retained earnings as of December 1, 2006. The Company will also elect to fair value certain servicing rights
acquired after December 1, 2006.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s
financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for the Company as of December 1, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting
FIN 48.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157. SFAS
No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In addition, SFAS No. 157 disallows the use of block discounts for large holdings of unrestricted financial
instruments where quoted prices are readily and regularly available in an active market, and nullifies select guidance provided by EITF Issue No. 02-3, which prohibited the recognition of trading gains or losses at the inception of a derivative
contract, unless the fair value of such derivative is obtained from a quoted market price, or other valuation technique that incorporates observable market data. SFAS No. 157 also requires the Company to consider its own credit spreads when
measuring the fair value of liabilities, including derivatives. Effective December 1, 2006, the Company elected early adoption of SFAS No. 157. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 157 related to block discounts and EITF
Issue No. 02-3, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of approximately $80 million after-tax as an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings as of December 1, 2006, which was primarily associated with EITF Issue
No. 02-3. The impact of considering the Company’s own credit spreads when measuring the fair value of liabilities, including derivatives, did not have a material impact on fair value measurements at the date of adoption.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)” (“SFAS No. 158”). Among other items, SFAS No. 158 requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an
entity’s defined benefit and postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the financial statements and requires the measurement of defined benefit and postretirement plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employer’s fiscal
year. SFAS No. 158’s requirement to recognize the funded status in the financial statements is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006, and its requirement to use the fiscal year-end date as the measurement date is effective
for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 158 will have on its consolidated results of operations and cash flows. However, if SFAS No. 158 were to be applied by the Company as of
November 30, 2006, based on a September 30, 2006 measurement date, the effect on its consolidated statement of financial position would be an after-tax charge to Shareholders’ equity of approximately $355 million.

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Morgan Stanley’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Morgan Stanley;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Morgan Stanley’s management and directors; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of Morgan Stanley’s internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2006. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on management’s assessment and those criteria, management believes that Morgan Stanley maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of November 30, 2006.

Morgan Stanley’s
independent registered public accounting firm has audited and issued their attestation report on management’s assessment of Morgan Stanley’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears below.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Morgan Stanley:

We have audited management’s assessment, included within this November 30, 2006 Form 10-K of Morgan Stanley and subsidiaries (the “Company”) at Item 9A under the heading “Management’s Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting”, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statement of financial condition of the Company as of November 30, 2006 and



the related consolidated statement of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in shareholders’ equity for the year ended November 30, 2006
and our report dated February 12, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included explanatory paragraphs regarding the Company’s change in its accounting policy for recognition of equity awards granted to
retirement-eligible employees and the application of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements”.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

No change in Morgan Stanley’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2006 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Morgan Stanley’s internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Introduction and
Basis of Presentation.

Basis of Financial
Information.

The accompanying condensed financial statements (the “Parent Company Financial Statements”), including the notes thereto, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Morgan Stanley
(the “Company”) and the notes thereto found on pages 110 to 172 in this Form 10-K.

The Parent Company Financial Statements for the 12 months ended November 30, 2006 (“fiscal 2006”), November 30, 2005 (“fiscal 2005”) and November 30, 2004 (“fiscal
2004”) are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions regarding valuations of certain financial instruments, the potential outcome of litigation
and other matters that affect the Parent Company Financial Statements and related disclosures. The Company believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of the Parent Company Financial Statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results
could differ materially from these estimates.

2. Transactions with
Subsidiaries.

The Company has transactions with its consolidated
subsidiaries determined on an agreed-upon basis and has guaranteed certain unsecured lines of credit and contractual obligations of certain of its consolidated subsidiaries.

The Company received cash dividends from its consolidated subsidiaries totaling $1,838 million, $5,720 million and $3,333 million in fiscal
2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively.

3. Guarantees.

In the normal course of its business, the Company guarantees certain of
its subsidiaries’ obligations under derivative and other financial arrangements. The Company records all derivative contracts and Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased at fair value on its consolidated
statements of financial condition. For a discussion of the Company’s risk management activities, see Note 11 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The Company also, in the normal course of its business, provides standard indemnities to counterparties on behalf of its subsidiaries for
taxes, including U.S. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest and other payments made on derivatives, securities and stock lending transactions and certain annuity products. These indemnity payments could be required based on a change in the tax
laws or change in interpretation of applicable tax rulings. Certain contracts contain provisions that enable the Company to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of such events. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company
could be required to make under these indemnifications cannot be estimated. The Company has not recorded any contingent liability in the condensed financial statements for these indemnifications and believes that the occurrence of any events that
would trigger payments under these contracts is remote.

The Company has issued
guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries to various U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges and clearinghouses that trade and clear securities and/or futures contracts. Under these guarantee arrangements, the Company may be required to pay the financial
obligations of its subsidiaries related to business transacted on or with the exchanges and clearinghouses in the event of a subsidiary’s default on its obligations to the exchange or the clearinghouse. The Company has not recorded any
contingent liability in the condensed financial statements for these arrangements and believes that any potential requirements to make payments under these arrangements is remote.

S-5


The Company guarantees certain debt instruments and warrants issued by subsidiaries. The debt instruments totaled $10.5
billion and the warrants totaled $3.7 billion at November 30, 2006. In addition, the Company has provided guarantees for Morgan Stanley Japan Securities Co., Ltd.’s obligations under committed credit facilities of 80 billion Japanese yen
at November 30, 2006. In connection with subsidiary lease obligations, the Company has issued guarantees to various lessors. At November 30, 2006, the Company had $1.8 billion outstanding under subsidiary lease obligations, primarily in the
U.K.

4. Commitments and Contingencies.

For a discussion of the Company’s commitments and contingencies, see Note 9 to the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Morgan Stanley:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Morgan Stanley and subsidiaries
(the “Company”) as of November 30, 2006 and 2005, and for each of the three years in the period ended November 30, 2006, management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of November 30, 2006, and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2006, and have issued our reports thereon dated February 12, 2007 (such report on the
consolidated financial statements expresses an unqualified opinion and includes an explanatory paragraph concerning, in fiscal 2005, the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS
No. 123(R)”) and effective December 1, 2005, the change in accounting policy for recognition of equity awards granted to retirement-eligible employees and, in fiscal 2006, an explanatory paragraph concerning the application of Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 108 “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements” (“SAB No. 108”)); such consolidated financial statements and reports are included in
this 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our audits also included Schedule I listed in the Index to Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedules. This financial statement schedule is the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion based on our audits. In our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth therein.

In fiscal 2005, the Company adopted SFAS
No. 123(R).

In fiscal 2006, the Company changed its accounting policy for
recognition of equity awards granted to retirement-eligible employees and the Company elected application of SAB No. 108.
