PART I

ITEM 1.        BUSINESS

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated
real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and
substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). 
Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its
shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and
the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their
obligations to creditors.  Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately
 93.7%

of the common limited partnership
interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2015.  All references to
“we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust
and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership.

On January 15, 2015, we completed the spin-off of substantially
all of our retail segment comprised of 79 strip shopping centers, three malls, a
warehouse park and $225 million of cash to Urban Edge Properties (“UE”) (NYSE:
UE).  As part of this transaction, we received 5,717,184 UE operating
partnership units (5.4% ownership interest).

We currently own all or portions of:

New York:

·

21.3 million square feet of Manhattan office space in 35
properties;

·

2.6 million square feet of Manhattan street retail space in 65
properties;

·

1,711 units in eleven residential properties;

·

The 1,700 room Hotel Pennsylvania located on Seventh Avenue at 33

rd

Street in the heart of the Penn Plaza district;

·

A 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX), which owns
seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, including 731
Lexington Avenue, the 1.3 million square foot Bloomberg, L.P. headquarters
building;

Washington, DC:

·

15.8 million square feet of office space in 57 properties;

·

2,414 units in seven residential properties;

Other Real Estate and
Related Investments:

·

The 3.6 million square foot Mart (“theMart”) in Chicago;

·

A 70% controlling interest in 555 California Street, a
three-building office complex in San Francisco’s financial district aggregating
1.8 million square feet, known as the Bank of America Center;

·

A 25.0% interest in Vornado Capital Partners, our real estate
fund.  We are the general partner and investment manager of the fund;

·

A 32.5% interest in Toys “R” Us, Inc.; and

·

Other real estate and other investments.


Objectives and Strategy

Our business
objective is to maximize shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective
by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and execute our operating
strategies through:

·

Maintaining a superior team of operating
and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit

·

Investing in properties in select
markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe
there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation

·

Acquiring quality properties at a
discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for
higher rents

·

Investing in retail properties in select
under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area

·

Developing and redeveloping our existing
properties to increase returns and maximize value

·

Investing
in operating companies that have a significant real estate component

We expect to
finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated
funds, proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private
capital markets.  We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or
Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or
otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

fund’s limited partners to buy out the fund’s joint venture partner’s 57%
interest

DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES

We are
constructing a residential condominium tower containing 392,000 salable square
feet on our 220 Central Park South development site.  The incremental
development cost of this project is approximately $1.3 billion, of which $293
million has been expended as of December 31, 2015.

We are
developing The Bartlett, a 699-unit residential project in Pentagon City, which
is expected to be completed in 2016.  The project includes a 40,000 square foot
Whole Foods Market at the base of the building.  The incremental development
cost of this project is approximately $250 million, of which $166 million has
been expended as of December 31, 2015.

On June 24,
2015, we entered into a joint venture, in which we own a 55% interest, to
develop a 173,000 square foot Class-A office building, located along the
western edge of the High Line at 512 West 22nd Street in the West Chelsea
submarket of Manhattan.  The development cost of this project is approximately
$235 million.  On November 24, 2015, the joint venture obtained a $126 million
construction loan.  The loan matures in November 2019 with two six-month
extension options.  The interest rate is LIBOR plus 2.65% (3.07% at December
31, 2015).  As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance of the loan was
$44.1 million, of which $24.2 million is our share.

On July 23,
2014, a joint venture in which we are a 50.1% partner entered into a 99-year
ground lease for 61 Ninth Avenue located on the Southwest corner of Ninth
Avenue and 15th Street in the West Chelsea submarket of Manhattan.  The
venture’s current plans are to construct an office building, with retail at the
base, of approximately 167,000 square feet.  Total development costs are
currently estimated to be approximately $150 million.

We plan to
demolish two adjacent Washington, DC office properties, 1726 M Street and 1150
17th Street in the first half of 2016 and replace them in the future with a new
335,000 square foot Class A office building, to be addressed 1700 M Street. 
The incremental development cost of the project is approximately $170 million.

We are also
evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our
properties in Manhattan, including the Penn Plaza District, and in Washington,
including Crystal City, Rosslyn and Pentagon City.

There can be
no assurance that any of our development or redevelopment projects will
commence, or if commenced, be completed, or completed on schedule or within
budget.


SEGMENT
DATA

We operate in the following
business segments: New York and Washington, DC.  Financial information related
to these business segments for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013
is set forth in Note 24 – Segment Information to our consolidated financial
statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

SEASONALITY

Our revenues and expenses are
subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings,
cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the
current quarter to the previous quarter.  The New York and Washington, DC
segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and
third quarters of the year.

tenants ACCOUNTING FOR over 10% of revenues

None of our tenants accounted for
more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014
and 2013

.

Certain Activities

We do not base our acquisitions and investments on
specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our
properties for long‑term investment; however, it is possible that
properties in our portfolio may be sold when circumstances warrant. Further, we
have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which
could be invested in a specific property or property type. While we may seek
the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material
transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from
time to time by our Board of Trustees without the vote of shareholders.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we have approximately 4,089

employees, of which 298 are corporate staff. The New
York segment has 3,242 employees, including 2,566

employees
of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides
cleaning, security and engineering services primarily to our New York and
Washington, DC properties and


employees at the Hotel Pennsylvania. The Washington,
DC segment and theMart properties have 462

and 87
employees, respectively.  The foregoing does not include employees of partially
owned entities.

principal executive offices

Our principal executive offices are located at 888
Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019; telephone (212) 894‑7000.

ITEM
1A.     RISK FACTORS

Material factors that may adversely affect our
business, operations and financial condition are summarized below.  The risks
and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones we face. 
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we
currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.  See
“Forward-Looking Statements” contained herein on page 4.

Real Estate
Investments’ Value and Income Fluctuate Due to Various Factors.

The value of real estate fluctuates depending on
conditions in the general economy and the real estate business. These
conditions may also adversely impact our revenues and cash flows.

The factors that affect the value of our real
estate investments include, among other things:

·

global,
national, regional and local economic conditions;

·

competition
from other available space;

·

local
conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real
estate in the area;

·

how
well we manage our properties;

·

the development and/or redevelopment of our properties;

·

changes
in market rental rates;

·

the
timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;

·

whether
we are able to pass all or portions of any increases in operating costs through
to tenants;

·

changes
in real estate taxes and other expenses;

·

whether
tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property
attractive;

·

changes in space utilization by our tenants due to technology,
economic conditions and business environment;

·

the
financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies
or defaults;

·

availability
of financing on acceptable terms or at all;

·

inflation or deflation;

·

fluctuations
in interest rates;

·

our
ability to obtain adequate insurance;

·

changes
in zoning laws and taxation;

·

government
regulation;

·

consequences
of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attacks against, the United
States or individual acts of violence in public spaces including retail
centers;

·

potential
liability under environmental or other laws or regulations;

·

natural disasters;

·

general
competitive factors; and

·

climate changes.

The rents or sales proceeds we receive and the
occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes
in any of these factors. If rental revenues, sales proceeds and/or occupancy
levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available to pay
indebtedness and for distribution to shareholders. In addition, some of our
major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance
costs generally do not decline when the related rents decline.

Capital
markets and economic conditions can materially affect our liquidity, financial
condition and results of operations as well as the value of our debt and equity
securities.

There are many factors that can affect the value
of our debt and equity securities, including the state of the capital markets
and the economy.  Demand for office and retail space may decline nationwide, as
it did in 2008 and 2009 due to the economic downturn, bankruptcies, downsizing,
layoffs and cost cutting.  Government action or inaction may adversely affect
the state of the capital markets.  The cost and availability of credit may be
adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads, which
may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our
results of operations, and the liquidity and financial condition of our
tenants.  Our inability or the inability of our tenants to timely refinance
maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs may
materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the
value of our debt and equity securities.


Real
estate is a competitive business.

We compete with a large number of real estate
property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower
returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents
charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property
and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon,
among other factors, trends of the global, national, regional and local
economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and
prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital,
construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations,
legislation, population and employment trends.

We depend on leasing space
to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from tenants who
may not be able to pay.

Our financial results depend significantly on
leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms. In
addition, because a majority of our income comes from renting of real property,
our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and funds available for
distribution to shareholders will decrease if a significant number of our
tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain occupancy
levels on favorable terms. If a tenant does not pay its rent, we may not be
able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial
legal costs.  During periods of economic adversity, there may be an increase in
the number of tenants that cannot pay their rent and an increase in vacancy
rates.

We may be unable to renew
leases or relet space as leases expire.

When our tenants decide not to renew their leases
upon their expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if tenants
do renew or we can relet the space, the terms of renewal or reletting, taking
into account among other things, the cost of improvements to the property and
leasing commissions, may be less favorable than the terms in the expired
leases. In addition, changes in space utilization by our tenants may impact our
ability to renew or relet space without the need to incur substantial costs in
renovating or redesigning the internal configuration of the relevant property.
If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space at similar
rates or if we incur substantial costs in renewing or reletting the space, our
cash flow and ability to service debt obligations and pay dividends and
distributions to security holders could be adversely affected.

Bankruptcy or insolvency of
tenants may decrease our revenue, net income and available cash.

From time to time, some of our tenants have
declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become
insolvent in the future. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could
cause us to suffer lower revenues and operational difficulties, including
leasing the remainder of the property. As a result, the bankruptcy or
insolvency of a major tenant could result in decreased revenue, net income and
funds available to pay our indebtedness or make distributions to shareholders.

We may
incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and environmental
contamination may impair our ability to lease and/or sell real estate.

Our operations and properties are subject to
various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection
of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic
substances and health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or
previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and
clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or
operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties
for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs
incurred by those parties because of the contamination. These laws often impose
liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release
of the substances or caused the release. The presence of contamination or the
failure to remediate contamination may impair our ability to sell or lease real
estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other laws and
regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can
require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event
of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of
and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. The maintenance and removal of lead
paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) are also regulated by federal and state laws. We are also subject to
risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants
such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can
be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in
susceptible individuals. Our predecessor companies may be subject to similar
liabilities for activities of those companies in the past.  We could incur
fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial
action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or related claims
arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure to contamination
at or from our properties.


Each of our properties
has been subject to varying degrees of environmental assessment. To date, these
environmental assessments have not revealed any environmental condition
material to our business. However, identification of new compliance concerns or
undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of
contamination, human exposure to contamination or changes in clean-up or
compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us.

In addition, we may become subject to costs or
taxes, or increases therein, associated with natural resource or energy usage
(such as a “carbon tax”).  These costs or taxes could increase our operating
costs and decrease the cash available to pay our obligations or distribute to
equity holders.

We face
risks associated with our tenants being designated “Prohibited Persons” by the
Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar requirements.

Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws,
the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the
Treasury (“OFAC”) maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who
are otherwise blocked or banned (“Prohibited Persons”) from conducting business
or engaging in transactions in the United States and thereby restricts our
doing business with such persons.  We are required to comply with OFAC and
related requirements and may be required to terminate or otherwise amend our
leases, loans and other agreements.  If a tenant or other party with whom we
conduct business is placed on the OFAC list or is otherwise a party with which
we are prohibited from doing business, we may be required to terminate the
lease or other agreement.  Any such termination could result in a loss of
revenue or otherwise negatively affect our financial results and cash flows.

Our
business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.

Despite system redundancy, the implementation of
security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our
internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages
from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access,
energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication
failures.  Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our
operations could result in a material disruption to our business.  We may also
incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions.

The
occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cyber security, could
negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a
compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our
business relationships or reputation, all of which could negatively impact our
financial results.

We face risks associated with security breaches,
whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware,
computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons who access our systems from
inside or outside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our IT
networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption,
particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer
hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as
the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions
from around the world have increased. Our IT networks and related systems
are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform
day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems) and, in some
cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. Although we
make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of
IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures
to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no
assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that
attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.
Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities
remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted
security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched
against a target, and in some cases are designed to not be detected and, in
fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these
techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative
measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.

A security breach or other significant disruption
involving our IT networks and related systems could disrupt the proper
functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or
those of certain of our tenants; result in the unauthorized access to, and
destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary,
confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others,
which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage
claims by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful
purposes and outcomes; result in our inability to maintain the building systems
relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space; require
significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that
result; subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits,
penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our
reputation among our tenants and investors generally. Any or all of the
foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.


Some of our potential losses may not be covered by
insurance.

We maintain general liability
insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, and all
risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per
occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as flood and earthquake.
Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of
$180,000,000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate, subject to a
deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. We
maintain coverage for terrorism acts with limits of $4.0 billion per occurrence
and in the aggregate, and $2.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for
terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”)
terrorism events, as defined by Terrorism Risk Insurance Program
Reauthorization Act of 2015, which expires in December 2020.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC
(“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with
respect to a portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a
portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for
coverage for acts of terrorism including NBCR acts. Coverage for acts of
terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance
companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. For NBCR acts,
PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 ($2,400,000 effective
January 1, 2016) per occurrence and 15% of the balance of a covered loss (16%
effective January 1, 2016) and the Federal government is responsible for the
remaining 85% of a covered loss (84% effective January 1, 2016). We are
ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance
market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we
cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable
terms in the future.

Our debt
instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are
non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements
contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we
believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these
agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at
reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage
than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our
properties and expand our portfolio.

Compliance
or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety
regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”)
generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, meet
certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. 
Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government
or the award of damages to private litigants and/or legal fees to their
counsel.  From time to time persons have asserted claims against us with
respect to some of our properties under the ADA, but to date such claims have
not resulted in any material expense or liability.  If, under the ADA, we are
required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or
more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as
the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders.

Our properties are subject to various federal,
state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life
safety requirements.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could
incur fines or private damage awards.  We do not know whether existing
requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will
require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow
and results of operations.


Our
Investments Are Concentrated in the New York CITY METROPOLITAN AREA and
Washington, DC / NORTHERN VIRGINIA Area. Circumstances Affecting These Areas
Generally Could Adversely Affect Our Business.

A significant
portion of our properties are located in the New York City / New Jersey
metropolitan area and Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area and are affected
by the economic cycles and risks inherent to those areas.

In 2015, approximately 92% of our EBITDA,
excluding items that affect comparability, came from properties located in the
New York City metropolitan area and the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia
area.  We may continue to concentrate a significant portion of our future
acquisitions in these areas or in other geographic real estate markets in the
United States or abroad.  Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns
and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact these markets in
either the short or long term. Declines in the economy or declines in real
estate markets in these areas could hurt our financial performance and the
value of our properties.  In addition to the factors affecting the national
economic condition generally, the factors affecting economic conditions in these
regions include:

·

financial
performance and productivity of the media, advertising, financial, technology,
retail, insurance and real estate industries;

·

space
needs of, and budgetary constraints affecting, the United States Government,
including the effect of a deficit reduction plan and/or base closures and
repositioning under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 2005, as
amended;

·

business
layoffs or downsizing;

·

industry
slowdowns;

·

relocations
of businesses;

·

changing
demographics;

·

increased
telecommuting and use of alternative work places;

·

infrastructure
quality; and

·

any
oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.

It is impossible for us to assess the future
effects of trends in the economic and investment climates of the geographic
areas in which we concentrate, and more generally of the United States, or the
real estate markets in these areas.  Local, national or global economic
downturns, would negatively affect our businesses and profitability.

Terrorist
attacks, such as those of September 11, 2001 in New York City and the Washington,   DC area, may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to
generate cash flow.

We have significant investments in large
metropolitan areas, including the New York, Washington, DC, Chicago and San
Francisco metropolitan areas. In response to a terrorist attack or the
perceived threat of terrorism, tenants in these areas may choose to relocate
their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that
may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity and
fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in these areas. This, in
turn, would trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these areas, which
could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease space on less
favorable terms. As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our
revenues and cash flows could decline materially.

Natural
disasters and the effects of climate change could have a concentrated impact on
the areas where we operate and could adversely impact our results.

Our investments are concentrated in the New York,
Washington, DC, Chicago and San Francisco metropolitan areas.  Natural
disasters, including earthquakes, storms and hurricanes, could impact our
properties in these and other areas in which we operate.  Potentially adverse
consequences of “global warming” could similarly have an impact on our
properties.  As a result, we could become subject to significant losses and/or
repair costs that may or may not be fully covered by insurance and to the risk
of business interruption.  The incurrence of these losses, costs or business
interruptions may adversely affect our operating and financial results.


We May Acquire or Sell Assets or Entities or Develop Properties. Our Failure or Inability to Consummate These Transactions or Manage the Results of These Transactions Could Adversely Affect Our Operations and Financial Results.

We may acquire, develop or redevelop real estate and acquire related companies and this may create risks.

We may acquire, develop or redevelop properties or acquire real estate related companies when we believe doing so is consistent with our business strategy. We may not succeed in (i) developing, redeveloping or acquiring real estate and real estate related companies; (ii) completing these activities on time or within budget; and (iii) leasing or selling developed, redeveloped or acquired properties at amounts sufficient to cover our costs.  Competition in these activities could also significantly increase our costs. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management’s attention. Acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in weaker than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred.  Furthermore, we may be exposed to the liabilities of properties or companies acquired, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition.

From time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, one or more material acquisitions.  The announcement of such a material acquisition may result in a rapid and significant decline in the price of our common shares.

We are continuously looking at material transactions that we believe will maximize shareholder value.  However, an announcement by us of one or more significant acquisitions could result in a quick and significant decline in the price of our common shares.

It may be difficult to buy and sell real estate quickly, which may limit our flexibility.

Real estate investments are relatively difficult to buy and sell quickly. Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.

We may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the debt associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs.  In addition, when we dispose of or sell assets, we may not be able to reinvest the sales proceeds and earn similar returns.

As part of an acquisition of a property, or a portfolio of properties, we may agree, and in the past have agreed, not to dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness for a long-term period, unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the seller. These agreements could result in us holding on to properties that we would otherwise sell and not pay down or refinance.  In addition, when we dispose of or sell assets, we may not be able to reinvest the sales proceeds and earn returns similar to those generated by the assets that were sold.

From time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, investments in companies over which we do not have sole control. Some of these companies operate in industries with different risks than investing and operating real estate.

From time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, investments in companies that we may not control, including, but not limited to, Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”), Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”), Lexington Realty Trust (“Lexington”), Urban Edge Properties (“UE”), Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (“PREIT”), and other equity and loan investments. Although these businesses generally have a significant real estate component, some of them operate in businesses that are different from investing and operating real estate, including operating or managing toy stores. Consequently, we are subject to operating and financial risks of those industries and to the risks associated with lack of control, such as having differing objectives than our partners or the entities in which we invest, or becoming involved in disputes, or competing directly or indirectly with these partners or entities.  In addition, we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may adversely affect us.

We are subject to risks that affect the general and New York City retail environments.

Certain of our properties are Manhattan street retail properties.  As such, these properties are affected by the general and New York City retail environments, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, the threat of terrorism and increasing competition from retailers, outlet malls, retail websites and catalog companies.  These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our retail locations, and in turn, adversely affect us.


Our investment in Toys has in the past and may in the
future result in increased seasonality and volatility in our reported earnings.

We carry our Toys investment at zero.  As a result, we
no longer record our equity in Toys' income or loss.   Because Toys
is a retailer, its operations subject us to the risks of a retail company that
are different than those presented by our other lines of business. The business
of Toys is highly seasonal and substantially all of Toys net income is
generated in its fourth quarter.  It is possible that the value of Toys may
increase and we could again resume recording our equity in Toys' income or
loss, which would increase the seasonality and volatility of our reported
earnings.

Our decision to dispose of real estate assets would change
the holding period assumption in our valuation analyses, which could result in
material impairment losses and adversely affect our financial results.

We evaluate
real estate assets for impairment based on the projected cash flow of the asset
over our anticipated holding period.  If we change our intended holding period,
due to our intention to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset, then under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we
must reevaluate whether that asset is impaired.  Depending on the carrying
value of the property at the time we change our intention and the amount that
we estimate we would receive on disposal, we may record an impairment loss that
would adversely affect our financial results. This loss could be material to
our results of operations in the period that it is recognized.

We
invest in marketable equity securities.  The value of these investments may
decline as a result of operating performance or economic or market conditions.

We invest in marketable equity securities of
publicly-traded companies, such as Lexington Realty Trust.  As of December 31,
2015, our marketable securities have an aggregate carrying amount of $150,997,000,
at market.  Significant declines in the value of these investments due to,
among other reasons, operating performance or economic or market conditions,
may result in the recognition of impairment losses which could be material.

Our
Organizational and Financial Structure Gives Rise to Operational and Financial
Risks.

We may not be able to
obtain capital to make investments.

We depend primarily on external financing to fund
the growth of our business. This is because one of the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for a REIT is that it distributes
90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its shareholders.
There is a separate requirement to distribute net capital gains or pay a
corporate level tax in lieu thereof. Our access to debt or equity financing
depends on the willingness of third parties to lend or make equity investments
and on conditions in the capital markets generally. Although we believe that we
will be able to finance any investments we may wish to make in the foreseeable
future, there can be no assurance that new financing will be available or
available on acceptable terms.  For information about our available sources of
funds, see

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources”

and the notes to
the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Vornado
Realty Trust (“Vornado”) depends on dividends and distributions from its direct
and indirect subsidiaries. The creditors and preferred security holders of
these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries
before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to Vornado.

Substantially all of Vornado’s assets are held
through its Operating Partnership that holds substantially all of its
properties and assets through subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership’s cash
flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by its subsidiaries, and in turn,
substantially all of Vornado’s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to
it by the Operating Partnership. The creditors of each of Vornado’s direct and
indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations
to them, when due and payable, before distributions may be made by that
subsidiary to its equity holders. Thus, the Operating Partnership’s ability to
make distributions to holders of its units depends on its subsidiaries’ ability
first to satisfy their obligations to their creditors and then to make
distributions to the Operating Partnership. Likewise, Vornado’s ability to pay
dividends to holders of common and preferred shares depends on the Operating
Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and
make distributions payable to holders of preferred units and then to make
distributions to Vornado.

Furthermore, the holders of preferred units of the
Operating Partnership are entitled to receive preferred distributions before
payment of distributions to holders of Class A units of the Operating
Partnership, including Vornado. Thus, Vornado’s ability to pay cash dividends
to its shareholders and satisfy its debt obligations depends on the Operating
Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and
make distributions to holders of its preferred units and then to holders of its
Class A units, including Vornado.  As of December 31, 2015, there were four
series of preferred units of the Operating Partnership not held by Vornado with
a total liquidation value of $56,007,000.


In addition, Vornado’s
participation in any distribution of the assets of any of its direct or
indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency, is
only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors and preferred
security holders, are satisfied.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could
affect our future operations.

As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated
mortgages and unsecured indebtedness, excluding related premium, discount and
deferred financing costs, net, totaled $11.2 billion. We are subject to
the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our
cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service.
Our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the
property, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants,
cause a reduction in the income from the property. Should such events occur,
our operations may be adversely affected. If a property is mortgaged to secure
payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay
that indebtedness, the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee
resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value.

We have
outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may increase and
refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.

We rely on both secured and unsecured, variable
rate and non-variable rate debt to finance acquisitions and development
activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt financing
or refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and
results of operations would likely be adversely affected.  In addition, the
cost of our existing debt may increase, especially in the case of a rising
interest rate environment, and we may not be able to refinance our existing
debt in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms.  If the cost or amount of
our indebtedness increases or we cannot refinance our debt in sufficient
amounts or on acceptable terms, we are at risk of credit ratings downgrades and
default on our obligations that could adversely affect our financial condition
and results of operations.

Covenants
in our debt instruments could adversely affect our financial condition and our
acquisitions and development activities.

The mortgages on our properties contain customary
covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of
the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue insurance
coverage. Our unsecured indebtedness and debt that we may obtain in the future
may contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our
ability to incur indebtedness, including covenants that limit our ability to
incur debt based upon the level of our ratio of total debt to total assets, our
ratio of secured debt to total assets, our ratio of EBITDA to interest expense,
and fixed charges, and that require us to maintain a certain level of
unencumbered assets to unsecured debt. Our ability to borrow is subject to
compliance with these and other covenants. In addition, failure to comply with
our covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt instrument, and
we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources or
give possession of a secured property to the lender. Under those circumstances,
other sources of capital may not be available to us, or may be available only
on unattractive terms.

A downgrade in our credit
ratings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.

Our credit rating and the credit ratings assigned
to our debt securities and our preferred shares could change based upon, among
other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings
are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and any rating
could be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its
judgment, circumstances warrant such action. Moreover, these credit ratings are
not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our common shares or any other
securities. If any of the credit rating agencies that have rated our securities
downgrades or lowers its credit rating, or if any credit rating agency
indicates that it has placed any such rating on a “watch list” for a possible
downgrading or lowering, or otherwise indicates that its outlook for that
rating is negative, such action could have a material adverse effect on our
costs and availability of funding, which could in turn have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the
trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service
obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders.


Vornado
may fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT and may be required to pay
income taxes at corporate rates.

Although we believe that we will remain organized
and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes, we may fail to remain so qualified. Qualifications are governed by
highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which
there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and depend on
various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control. In
addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court
decisions may significantly change the relevant tax laws and/or the federal
income tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT. If, with respect to any taxable
year, we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT and do not qualify under
statutory relief provisions, we could not deduct distributions to shareholders
in computing our taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on our
taxable income at regular corporate rates. The federal income tax payable would
include any applicable alternative minimum tax. If we had to pay federal income
tax, the amount of money available to distribute to shareholders and pay our
indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved, and we would not
be required to make distributions to shareholders in that taxable year and in
future years until we were able to qualify as a REIT.  In addition, we
would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years
following the year during which qualification was lost, unless we were entitled
to relief under the relevant statutory provisions.

We face possible adverse changes in tax laws, which may
result in an increase in our tax liability.

From time to time changes in state and local tax
laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax
liability. The shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in
recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes.
If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets
or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for
payment of dividends.

Loss of
our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of
our common shares.

We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth,
the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado. 
While we believe that we could find a replacement for him and other key
personnel, the loss of their services could harm our operations and adversely
affect the value of our common shares.

Vornado’s
charter documents and applicable law may hinder any attempt to acquire us.

Our Amended and Restated
Declaration of Trust (the “declaration of trust”) sets limits on the ownership
of our shares.

Generally, for Vornado to maintain its
qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% in
value of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of Vornado may be owned,
directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the
last half of Vornado’s taxable year. The Internal Revenue Code defines
“individuals” for purposes of the requirement described in the preceding
sentence to include some types of entities. Under Vornado’s declaration of trust,
as amended, no person may own more than 6.7% of the outstanding common shares
of any class, or 9.9% of the outstanding preferred shares of any class, with
some exceptions for persons who held common shares in excess of the 6.7% limit
before Vornado adopted the limit and other persons approved by Vornado’s Board
of Trustees. These restrictions on transferability and ownership may delay, deter
or prevent a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might
involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the
shareholders.

The Maryland General Corporation Law (the “MGCL”)
contains provisions that may reduce the likelihood of certain takeover
transactions.

The MGCL imposes conditions and restrictions on
certain “business combinations” (including, among other transactions, a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, or, in certain circumstances, an asset transfer
or issuance of equity securities) between a Maryland REIT and certain persons
who beneficially own at least 10% of the corporation’s stock (an “interested
shareholder”). Unless approved in advance by the board of trustees of the
trust, or otherwise exempted by the statute, such a business combination is
prohibited for a period of five years after the most recent date on which the
interested shareholder became an interested shareholder.  After such five-year
period, a business combination with an interested shareholder must be: (a)
recommended by the board of trustees of the trust, and (b) approved by the
affirmative vote of at least (i) 80% of the trust’s outstanding shares entitled
to vote and (ii) two-thirds of the trust’s outstanding shares entitled to vote
which are not held by the interested shareholder with whom the business
combination is to be effected, unless, among other things, the trust’s common
shareholders receive a “fair price” (as defined by the statute) for their
shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as
previously paid by the interested shareholder for his or her shares.


In approving a transaction, the Board may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the Board.  Vornado’s Board has adopted a resolution exempting any business combination between Vornado and any trustee or officer of Vornado or its affiliates.  As a result, any trustee or officer of Vornado or its affiliates may be able to enter into business combinations with Vornado that may not be in the best interest of Vornado’s shareholders. With respect to business combinations with other persons, the business combination provisions of the MGCL may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the shareholders. The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of Vornado and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.

Vornado has a classified Board of Trustees and that may reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Vornado’s Board of Trustees is divided into three classes of trustees. Trustees of each class are chosen for three-year staggered terms. Staggered terms of trustees may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of Vornado, even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of Vornado’s shareholders.

We may issue additional shares in a manner that could adversely affect the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Vornado’s declaration of trust authorizes the Board of Trustees to:

·

cause Vornado to issue additional authorized but unissued common shares or preferred shares;

·

classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred shares;

·

set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified shares that Vornado issues; and

·

increase, without shareholder approval, the number of shares of beneficial interest that Vornado may issue.

The Board of Trustees could establish a series of preferred shares whose terms could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of Vornado’s shareholders, although the Board of Trustees does not now intend to establish a series of preferred shares of this kind. Vornado’s declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders.

We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our shareholders.

Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other companies, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Trustees. Accordingly, our shareholders do not control these policies.

Our Ownership Structure and Related-Party Transactions May Give Rise to Conflicts of Interest.

Steven Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of our other trustees and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.

As of December 31, 2015, Interstate Properties, a New Jersey general partnership, and its partners owned an aggregate of approximately 7.1% of the common shares of Vornado and 26.3% of the common stock of Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX) (“Alexander’s”), which is described below.  Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the three partners of Interstate Properties. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties, and the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s. Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are Trustees of Vornado and also Directors of Alexander’s.

Because of these overlapping interests, Mr. Roth and Interstate Properties and its partners may have substantial influence over Vornado and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Vornado’s shareholders for approval. In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate Properties and our other equity or debt holders. In addition, Mr. Roth, Interstate Properties and its partners, and Alexander’s currently and may in the future engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as which of these entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these entities.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate Properties under a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent.  See the related party disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.


There
may be conflicts of interest between Alexander’s and us.

As of December 31, 2015, we owned 32.4% of the
outstanding common stock of Alexander’s. Alexander’s is a REIT that has seven properties,
which are located in the greater New York metropolitan area.  In addition to
the 2.3% that they indirectly own through Vornado, Interstate Properties, which
is described above, and its partners owned 26.3% of the outstanding common
stock of Alexander’s as of December 31, 2015. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of
the Board and Chief Executive Office of Vornado, the managing general partner
of Interstate Properties, and the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer of Alexander’s.  Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are Trustees of
Vornado and also Directors of Alexander’s and general partners of Interstate Properties. 
Dr. Richard West is a Trustee of Vornado and a Director of Alexander’s.  In
addition, Joseph Macnow, our Executive Vice President – Finance and Chief
Administrative Officer, is the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer of Alexander’s, and Stephen W. Theriot, our Chief Financial Officer, is
the Assistant Treasurer of Alexander’s.

We manage, develop and lease Alexander’s
properties under management and development agreements and leasing agreements
under which we receive annual fees from Alexander’s. See the related party
disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

The Number of Shares
of Vornado Realty Trust and the Market for Those Shares Give Rise to Various
Risks.

The trading price of our
common shares has been volatile and may fluctuate.

The trading price of our common shares has been
volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of a number of
factors, many of which are outside our control.  In addition, the stock market
is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect
the market prices of the shares of many companies.  These broad market
fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market
price of our common shares.  Among the factors that could affect the price of
our common shares are:

·

our financial condition and performance;

·

the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of
tenant bankruptcies or defaults;

·

actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating
results and financial condition;

·

our dividend policy;

·

the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and
the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in comparison to other equity
securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and
fixed income securities;

·

uncertainty and volatility in the equity and credit markets;

·

fluctuations in interest rates;

·

changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of
research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by
rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs;

·

failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;

·

speculation in the press or investment community;

·

strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions
or restructurings;

·

the extent of institutional investor interest in us;

·

the extent of short-selling of our common shares and the shares
of our competitors;

·

fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our
competitors;

·

general financial and economic market conditions and, in
particular, developments related to market conditions for REITs and other real
estate related companies;

·

domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our
performance; and

·

all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report
on the Form 10-K.

A significant
decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for shareholders.

Vornado
has many shares available for future sale, which could hurt the market price of
its shares.

The interests of our current shareholders could be
diluted if we issue additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2015, we
had authorized but unissued, 61,423,147 common shares of beneficial interest,
$.04 par value and 57,266,023 preferred shares of beneficial interest, no par
value; of which 19,923,393 common shares are reserved for issuance upon
redemption of Class A Operating Partnership units, convertible securities and
employee stock options and 11,200,000 preferred shares are reserved for
issuance upon redemption of preferred Operating Partnership units.  Any shares
not reserved may be issued from time to time in public or private offerings or
in connection with acquisitions.  In addition, common and preferred shares
reserved may be sold upon issuance in the public market after registration
under the Securities Act or under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or
other available exemptions from registration.  We cannot predict the effect
that future sales of our common and preferred shares or Operating Partnership
Class A and preferred units will have on the market prices of our outstanding
shares.

In addition, under Maryland law, the Board has the
authority to increase the number of authorized shares without shareholder
approval.


Item 1b.     unresolved
staff comments

There are no unresolved comments from the staff of
the Securities Exchange Commission as of the date of this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

As of December 31, 2015, we own junior and senior mezzanine loans of 85 Tenth Avenue with an accreted balance of $164.6 million.  The junior and senior mezzanine loans bear paid-in-kind interest of 12% and 9%, respectively and mature in May 2017.  We account for our investment in 85 Tenth Avenue using the equity method of accounting because we will receive a 49.9% equity interest in the property after repayment of the junior mezzanine loan.  As a result of recording our share of the GAAP losses of the property, the net carrying amount of these loans is $24.8 million on our consolidated balance sheets.

(4)

We own a 25% interest in the Fund. The ownership percentage in this section represents the Fund's ownership in the underlying asset.


New York

As of December 31, 2015, our New York segment consisted of 29.3

million square feet in 84 properties.  The 29.3 million square feet is comprised of 21.3 million square feet of office space in 35 properties, 2.6 million square feet of retail space in 65 properties, 1,711 units in eleven residential properties, the 1.4 million square foot Hotel Pennsylvania, and our 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”), which owns seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area.  The New York segment also includes 11 garages totaling 1.7 million square feet (4,980 spaces) which are managed by, or leased to, third parties.

New York lease terms generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 20 years for major tenants, and may provide for extension options at market rates.  Leases typically provide for periodic step‑ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants their share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year.  Electricity is provided to tenants on a sub-metered basis or included in rent based on surveys and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases.  Leases also typically provide for free rent and tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.

As of December 31, 2015, the occupancy rate for our New York segment was 96.4%.

Performance Graph

The following graph is a comparison of the five-year cumulative return of our common shares, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (the “S&P 500 Index”) and the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts’ (“NAREIT”) All Equity Index, a peer group index.  The graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2010 in our common shares, the S&P 500 Index and the NAREIT All Equity Index and that all dividends were reinvested without the payment of any commissions.  There can be no assurance that the performance of our shares will continue in line with the same or similar trends depicted in the graph below.

FFO
is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors
of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). 
NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gain from
sales of depreciated real estate assets, real estate impairment losses,
depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other
specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of
unconsolidated subsidiaries.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP
financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate
meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our
peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization
and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly
assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather
than fluctuating based on existing market conditions.  FFO does not represent
cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of
cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an
alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flows as a liquidity
measure.  FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by
other companies.

Overview

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated
real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and
substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). 
Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its
shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and
the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their
obligations to creditors.  Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately
 93.7% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership
at December 31, 2015.  All references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and
“Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries,
including the Operating Partnership.

On January 15, 2015, we completed the spin-off of
substantially all of our retail segment comprised of 79 strip shopping centers,
three malls, a warehouse park and $225,000,000 of cash to Urban Edge Properties
(“UE”) (NYSE: UE). As part of this transaction, we retained 5,717,184 UE
operating partnership units (5.4% ownership interest). We are providing
transition services to UE for an initial period of up to two years, primarily
for information technology support.  UE is providing us with leasing and
property management services for (i) certain small retail properties that we
plan to sell, and (ii) our affiliate, Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX) Rego Park
retail assets. Steven Roth, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is a
member of the Board of Trustees of UE. The spin-off distribution was effected
by Vornado distributing one UE common share for every two Vornado common
shares.  The historical financial results of UE are reflected in our
consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods
presented.

We own and operate office and retail properties
(our “core” operations) with large concentrations in the New York City
metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area. In
addition, we have a 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX)
(“Alexander’s”), which owns seven properties in the greater New York
metropolitan area, a 32.5% interest in Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”) as well as
interests in other real estate and related investments.

Our business
objective is to maximize shareholder value, which we measure by the total
return provided to our shareholders. Below is a table comparing our performance
to the FTSE NAREIT Office Index (“Office REIT”) and the Morgan Stanley REIT
Index (“RMS”) for the following periods ended December 31, 2015:

Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future
  performance.

We intend to achieve our business objective by
continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and execute our operating
strategies through:

·

Maintaining a
superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial
spirit

·

Investing in
properties in select markets, such as New York City and
Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital
appreciation

·

Acquiring
quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a
significant potential for higher rents

·

Investing in
retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City
metropolitan area

·

Developing and
redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value

·

Investing in
operating companies that have a significant real estate component

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and
investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from asset sales and by
accessing the public and private capital markets.  We may also offer Vornado common
or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and
may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

We compete with a large number of real estate
property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower
returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents
charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property
and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon,
among other factors, trends of the global, national, regional and local
economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and
prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital,
construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation,
population and employment trends.  See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A for additional
information regarding these factors.

Acquisitions

On January 20, 2015, we and one of our real
estate fund’s limited partners co-invested with the Fund to buy out the Fund’s
joint venture partner’s 57% interest in the Crowne Plaza Times Square Hotel. 
The purchase price for the 57% interest was approximately $95,000,000 (our
share $39,000,000) which valued the property at approximately $480,000,000. 
The property is encumbered by a $310,000,000 mortgage loan bearing interest at
LIBOR plus 2.80% which matures in December 2018 with a one-year extension
option.  Our aggregate ownership interest in the property increased to 33% from
11%.

On March 18, 2015, we acquired the Center
Building, a 437,000 square foot office building, located at 33-00 Northern
Boulevard in Long Island City, New York, for $142,000,000, including the
assumption of an existing $62,000,000, 4.43% mortgage maturing in October 2018.

On June 2, 2015, we completed the acquisition of
150 West 34th Street, a 78,000 square foot retail property leased to Old Navy
through May 2019, and 226,000 square feet of additional zoning air rights, for
approximately $355,000,000.  At closing we completed a $205,000,000 financing
of the property.

On
June 24, 2015, we entered into a joint venture, in which we own a 55% interest,
to develop a 173,000 square foot Class-A office building, located along the
western edge of the High Line at 512 West 22nd Street. The development cost of
this project is approximately $235,000,000. The development commenced during
the fourth quarter of 2015 and is expected to be completed in 2018. We account
for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method.

On July 31, 2015, we acquired 260 Eleventh
Avenue, a 235,000 square foot office property leased to the City of New York
through 2021 with two five-year renewal options, a 10,000 square foot parking
lot and additional air rights.  The transaction is structured as a 99-year
ground lease with an option to purchase the land for $110,000,000.  The $3,900,000
annual ground rent and the purchase option price escalate annually at the
lesser of 1.5% or CPI.  The buildings were purchased for 813,900 newly issued
Vornado Operating Partnership units valued at approximately $80,000,000.

On September 25, 2015, we acquired 265 West 34th
Street, a 1,700 square foot retail property and 15,200 square feet of
additional zoning air rights, for approximately $28,500,000.

Dispositions

On January 15, 2015, we completed the spin-off of
substantially all of our retail segment comprised of 79 strip shopping centers,
three malls, a warehouse park and $225,000,000 of cash to Urban Edge Properties
(“UE”) (NYSE: UE).  As part of this transaction, we retained 5,717,184 UE
operating partnership units (5.4% ownership interest).  We are providing
transition services to UE for an initial period of up to two years, primarily
for information technology support. UE is providing us with leasing and
property management services for (i) certain small retail properties that we
plan to sell, and (ii) our affiliate, Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX) Rego Park
retail assets. Steven Roth, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is a
member of the Board of Trustees of UE.  The spin-off distribution was effected
by Vornado distributing one UE common share for every two Vornado common
shares.

On March 13, 2015, we sold our Geary Street, CA
lease for $34,189,000, which resulted in a net gain of $21,376,000.

On March 25, 2015, the Fund completed the sale of
520 Broadway in Santa Monica, CA for $91,650,000.  The Fund realized a
$23,768,000 net gain over the holding period.

On March 31, 2015, we transferred the redeveloped
Springfield Town Center, a 1,350,000 square foot mall located in Springfield,
Fairfax County, Virginia, to PREIT Associates, L.P., which is the operating
partnership of Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (NYSE: PEI)
(collectively, “PREIT”).  The financial statement gain was $7,823,000, of which
$7,192,000 was recognized in the first quarter of 2015 and the remaining
$631,000 was deferred based on our ownership interest in PREIT.  In the first
quarter of 2014, we recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $20,000,000 on
Springfield Town Center which is included in “income from discontinued
operations” on our consolidated statements of income.

On August 6, 2015, we sold our 50% interest in
the Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, NJ to our joint venture partner for
$38,000,000, valuing the property at approximately $229,000,000, which resulted
in a net gain of $33,153,000.

On September 9, 2015, we completed the sale of
1750 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, a 278,000 square foot office building in
Washington, DC for $182,000,000, resulting in a net gain of approximately
$102,000,000 which is included in “net gain on disposition of wholly owned and
partially owned assets” on our consolidated statement of income.  The tax gain
of approximately $137,000,000 was deferred as part of a like-kind exchange.  We
are managing the property on behalf of the new owner.

On
December 22, 2015, we completed the sale of 20 Broad Street, a 473,000 square
foot office building in Manhattan for an aggregate consideration of
$200,000,000.  The total income from this transaction was approximately $157,000,000
comprised of approximately $142,000,000 from the gain on sale and $15,000,000
of lease termination income.

We
also sold five residual retail properties, in separate transactions, for an
aggregate of $10,731,000, which resulted in net gains of $3,675,000.

Financings

Secured Debt

On
April 1, 2015, we completed a $308,000,000 refinancing of RiverHouse
Apartments, a three building, 1,670 unit rental complex located in Arlington,
VA.  The loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.28% (1.52% at December 31, 2015)
and matures in 2025.  We realized net proceeds of approximately $43,000,000. 
The property was previously encumbered by a 5.43%, $195,000,000 mortgage
maturing in April 2015 and a $64,000,000 mortgage at LIBOR plus 1.53% maturing
in 2018.

On
June 2, 2015, we completed a $205,000,000 financing in connection with the
acquisition of 150 West 34th Street.  The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus
2.25% (2.52% at December 31, 2015) and matures in 2018 with two one-year
extension options.

On
July 28, 2015, we completed a $580,000,000 refinancing of 100 West 33rd Street,
a 1.1 million square foot property comprised of 855,000 square feet of
office space and the 256,000 square foot Manhattan Mall.  The loan is interest
only at LIBOR plus 1.65% (1.92% at December 31, 2015) and matures in July
2020.  We realized net proceeds of approximately $242,000,000.

On
September 22, 2015, we upsized the loan on our 220 Central Park South
development by $350,000,000 to $950,000,000.  The interest rate on the loan is
LIBOR plus 2.00% (2.42% at December 31, 2015) and the final maturity date is
2020.  In connection with the upsizing, the standby commitment for a
$500,000,000 mezzanine loan for this development has been terminated by payment
of a $15,000,000 contractual termination fee, which was capitalized as a
component of “development costs and construction in progress” on our
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.

On December 11, 2015, we completed a
$375,000,000 refinancing of 888 Seventh Avenue, a 882,000 square foot Manhattan
office building.  The five-year loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.60% (1.92%
at December 31, 2015) which was swapped for the term of the loan to a fixed
rate of 3.15% and matures in December 2020.  We realized net proceeds of
approximately $49,000,000.

On December 21, 2015, we completed a
$450,000,000 financing of the retail condominium of the St. Regis Hotel and the
adjacent retail town house located on Fifth Avenue at 55th Street.  The loan
matures in December 2020, with two one-year extension options.  The loan is
interest only at LIBOR plus 1.80% (2.19% at December 31, 2015) for the first
three years, LIBOR plus 1.90% for years four and five, and LIBOR plus 2.00%
during the extension periods.  We own a 74.3% controlling interest in the joint
venture which owns the property.

Senior Unsecured Notes

On January 1, 2015, we
redeemed all of the $500,000,000 principal amount of our outstanding 4.25%
senior unsecured notes, which were scheduled to mature on April 1, 2015, at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest through
December 31, 2014.

Unsecured Term Loan

On October 30, 2015, we entered into an
unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility in the maximum amount of
$750,000,000.  The facility matures in October 2018 with two one-year extension
options.  The interest rate is LIBOR plus 1.15% (1.40% at December 31, 2015) with
a fee of 0.20% per annum on the unused portion.  At closing, we drew
$187,500,000.  The facility provides that the maximum amount available is twice
the amount outstanding on April 29, 2016, limited to $750,000,000, and all
draws must be made by October 2017.  This facility, together with the
$950,000,000 development loan mentioned above, provides the funding for our 220
Central Park South development.

Washington, DC Segment

Comparable EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $3,467,000 behind last year.

We expect that Washington’s 2016 comparable EBITDA will be approximately $7,000,000 to $11,000,000 lower than 2015, comprised of:

(i)

core business being flat to $4,000,000 higher, offset by,

(ii)

occupancy of Skyline properties declining further, decreasing EBITDA by approximately $6,500,000, and

(iii)

1726 M Street and 1150 17th Street being taken out of service (to prepare for the development in the future of a new Class A trophy office building) decreasing EBITDA by approximately $4,500,000.

Of the 2,395,000 square feet subject to the effects of the Base Realignment and Closure (“BRAC”) statute, 393,000 square feet has been taken out of service for redevelopment and 1,372,000 square feet has been leased or is pending.

Critical
Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial
statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary
of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of
our consolidated financial statements.  The summary should be read in
conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies
included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Real Estate

Real estate is
carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Betterments,
major renewals and certain costs directly related to the improvement and
leasing of real estate are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as
incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book
value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the
construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are
capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed
the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete. If the cost
of the redeveloped property, including the net book value of the existing
property, exceeds the estimated fair value of redeveloped property, the excess
is charged to expense. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over
estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40 years. Tenant allowances are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which
approximate the useful lives of the assets.

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess
the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements,
identified intangibles, such as acquired above and below-market leases,
acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and
we allocate the purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value
based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and
capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future
cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating
results, known trends, and market/economic conditions.  We record acquired
intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases, acquired in-place
leases and tenant relationships) and acquired intangible liabilities (including
below–market leases) at their estimated fair value separate and apart from
goodwill. We amortize identified intangibles that have finite lives over the
period they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future
cash flows of the property or business acquired.

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the carrying
amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $14.7 billion and
$13.7 billion, respectively.  As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the carrying
amounts of identified intangible assets (including acquired above-market
leases, tenant relationships and acquired in-place leases) were $227,901,000
and $225,155,000, respectively, and the carrying amounts of identified
intangible liabilities, a component of “deferred revenue” on our consolidated
balance sheets, were $318,148,000 and $328,201,000, respectively.

Our properties, including any related intangible
assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An
impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate
projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an
undiscounted basis.  An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the
property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses
are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market
information at the time the analyses are prepared.  If our estimates of the
projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions
change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such
differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.  The
evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on
assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements
that could differ materially from actual results.  Plans to hold properties
over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.


Critical
Accounting Policies – continued

Partially Owned Entities

We consolidate entities in which we have a
controlling financial interest.  In determining whether we have a controlling
financial interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to
consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership
interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make
decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the
partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity
(“VIE”) and we are the primary beneficiary.  We are deemed to be the primary
beneficiary of a VIE when we have (i) the power to direct the activities of the
VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the
obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be
significant to the VIE. We generally do not control a partially owned entity if
the entity is not considered a VIE and the approval of all of the
partners/members is contractually required with respect to major decisions,
such as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange or other disposition
of real property, the hiring of a chief executive officer, the commencement,
compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or arbitration or the
placement of new or additional financing secured by assets of the venture.  We
account for investments under the equity method when the requirements for
consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the
operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at
cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash
contributions and distributions each period. Investments that do not qualify
for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost
method.

Investments in partially owned entities are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is
measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its
estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended
holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared. 
The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is
dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment
and market conditions.  If our estimates of the projected future cash flows,
the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities
are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on
market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be
different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial
statements.  The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is
based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and
capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the carrying
amounts of investments in partially owned entities were $1.6 billion and $1.2
billion, respectively.


Critical
Accounting Policies – continued

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We periodically evaluate the collectability of
amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts
($11,908,000 and $12,210,000 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively)
for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required
payments under the lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for
receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents ($2,751,000 and $3,188,000
as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively). This receivable arises from
earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease
agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and
considers payment history and current credit status in developing these
estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be
material to our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

We have the following revenue sources and revenue
recognition policies:

·

Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized
over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis
which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases. 
We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the
leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. 
In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance
for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a
reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease.

·

Percentage Rent — income arising from retail tenant leases that is
contingent upon tenant sales exceeding defined thresholds. These rents are
recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., when tenant sales
thresholds have been achieved).

·

Hotel Revenue — income arising from the operation of the Hotel
Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and
banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and
beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been
rendered.

·

Trade Shows Revenue — income arising from the operation of trade shows,
including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows
have occurred.

·

Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide
for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate
taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods
as the expenses are incurred.

·

Management, Leasing and Other Fees — income arising from contractual
agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is
recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.

Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among
other things, its collectibility. If our assessment of the collectibility of
revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be
material.

Income Taxes

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to
continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) under Sections
856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections,
a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend
to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not
be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its
shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income and
therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.  If we fail to
distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, or fail to meet
other REIT requirements, we may fail to qualify as a REIT which may result in
substantial adverse tax consequences.

Net
Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and
2013 - continued

Notes to preceding tabular
  information:

(1)

EBITDA
  represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and
  Amortization." We consider EBITDA a non-GAAP financial measure for
  making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as
  it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on
  equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we
  utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the
  performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be
  considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to
  similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)

Interest
  and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax expense in the
  reconciliation of net income to EBITDA includes our share of these items from
  partially owned entities.

Results primarily from (i) the acceleration of the recognition
  of compensation expense of $1,555 related to 2013-2015 Out-Performance Plans
  due to the modification of the vesting criteria of awards such that they
  fully vest at age 65.  The accelerated expense will result in lower general
  and administrative expense for 2016 of $706 and $849 thereafter; and (ii)
  higher payroll and related costs.

In 2015, we recognized net losses of $39,600 from our 666 Fifth Avenue (Office) joint venture as a result of our share of depreciation expense.  Also in 2015, we recognized our $12,800 share of a write-off of a below market lease liability related to a tenant vacating at 650 Madison Avenue.  In 2014, we recognized our $14,500 share of accelerated depreciation from our West 57th Street joint ventures in connection with the change in estimated useful life of those properties.

(2)

Includes a $14,806 and $5,771 non-cash impairment loss in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(3)

For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized net income of $2,500 from our investment in Toys, representing management fees earned and received, compared to a net loss of $73,556 for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was primarily due to a $75,196 non-cash impairment loss.

(4)

Includes interests in Independence Plaza, 85 Tenth Avenue, Fashion Center Mall, 50-70 West 93rd Street and others. In 2014, we recognized a $10,263 non-cash charge, comprised of a $5,959 impairment loss and a $4,304 loan loss reserve, on our equity and debt investments in Suffolk Downs.

  of income.

Interest and Other Investment Income,
net

Interest and other investment income, net was
$26,978,000 in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $38,752,000 in the
prior year

, a decrease in income of $11,774,000.

This
decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in the value of investments in our
deferred compensation plan (offset by a corresponding decrease in the liability
for plan assets in “general and administrative” expenses on our consolidated
statements of income).

Interest and Debt Expense

Interest and debt expense was

$378,025,000

in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared

to
$412,755,000 in the

prior year,

a decrease of
$34,730,000. This decrease was primarily due to (i) $26,652,000 of interest
savings from the redemption of the $445,000,000 principal amount of the
outstanding 7.875% senior unsecured notes during the fourth quarter of 2014,
(ii) $21,375,000 of interest savings from the redemption of the $500,000,000
principal amount of the outstanding 4.25% senior unsecured notes on January 1,
2015, partially offset by (iii) $5,297,000 of interest expense from the
issuance of $450,000,000 of 2.50% senior unsecured notes in June 2014, (iv)
$5,182,000 of interest expense from the current year’s financings of 150 West
34th Street and the Center Building, and (v) $3,481,000 of lower capitalized
interest.

Net Gain on Disposition of
Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets

Net gain on
disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets was $251,821,000

i

n the year ended December 31, 2015, $142,693,000
from the net gain on sale of 20 Broad Street, $102,404,000 from the net gain on
sale of 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue and $6,724,000 from the sale of residential
condominiums, compared to $13,568,000

in the year
ended December 31,


,

from the sale
of residential condominiums and a land parcel.

Income Tax Benefit (Expense)

In the year ended December 31, 2015, we had an
income tax benefit of $84,695,000, compared to an expense of $9,281,000 in the
prior year, a decrease in expense of $93,976,000.  This decrease in expense resulted
primarily from the reversal of the valuation allowances against certain of our
deferred tax assets, as we have concluded that it is more-likely than not that
we will generate sufficient taxable income from the sale of 220 Central Park
South residential condominium units to realize the deferred tax assets.

compared to $96,561,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $40,796,000.  This
decrease resulted primarily from lower net

income
allocated to the noncontrolling interests, including noncontrolling interests of
our real estate fund investments

.

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in the
Operating Partnership

Net income attributable to
noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership was $43,231,000 in the

Same Store EBITDA

Same store EBITDA represents EBITDA from property
level operations which are owned by us in both the current and prior year
reporting periods.  Same store EBITDA excludes segment-level overhead expenses,
which are expenses that we do not consider to be property-level expenses, as
well as other non-operating items.  We also present same store EBITDA on a cash
basis (which excludes income from the straight-lining of rents, amortization of
below-market leases, net of above-market leases and other non-cash adjustments). 
We present these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) facilitate meaningful
comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii)
make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii)
compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers. 
Same store EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or
cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures employed by other companies.

Below is the reconciliation of EBITDA to same
store EBITDA for each of our segments for the year ended December 31, 2015,

Notes to preceding tabular information:

New York:

(1)

The $14,302,000 increase in New York same store EBITDA resulted primarily from increases in Office and Retail EBITDA of $13,688,000 and $6,519,000, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in Hotel Pennsylvania EBITDA of $7,709,000.  The Office and Retail EBITDA increases resulted primarily from higher rents, including signage, partially offset by lower management and leasing fees and higher operating expenses, net of reimbursements.

(2)

Excluding Hotel Pennsylvania, same store EBITDA increased by 2.4%.

Washington, DC:

(3)

The $3,773,000 decrease in Washington, DC same store EBITDA resulted primarily from higher net operating expenses of $2,088,000, lower fee and other income of $942,000, and lower management and leasing fees of $480,000.

On June 7, 2013, we sold an 8.65% economic interest in our
  investment of Independence Plaza, which reduced our economic interest to
  50.1%.  As a result, we determined that we were no longer the primary
  beneficiary of the VIE and accordingly, we deconsolidated the operations of
  the property on June 7, 2013 and began accounting for our investment under
  the equity method.

(2)

Due to the completion of the project.  This decrease in revenue
  is substantially offset by a decrease in development costs expensed in the
  period.  See note (4) on page 61.

(3)

Represents the change in the elimination of intercompany fees
  from operating segments upon consolidation.  See note (3) on page 61.

$425,782,000 in the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $13,027,000.  This

and (ii) $18,568,000 of interest savings from the restructuring of the Skyline
properties mortgage loan in the fourth quarter of 2013, partially offset by
(iii) $13,287,000 of interest expense from the $600,000,000 financing of our
220 Central Park South development site in January 2014, (iv) $6,265,000 of
interest expense from the issuance of the $450,000,000 2.50% senior unsecured

Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 - continued

Notes to preceding tabular information:

(1)

EBITDA represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization." We consider EBITDA a non-GAAP financial measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)

Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax expense in the reconciliation of net income to EBITDA includes our share of these items from partially owned entities.

Same Store
EBITDA

Same store EBITDA represents EBITDA from property
level operations which are owned by us in both the current and prior year
reporting periods.  Same store EBITDA excludes segment-level overhead expenses,
which are expenses that we do not consider to be property-level expenses, as
well as other non-operating items.  We also present same store EBITDA on a cash
basis (which excludes income from the straight-lining of rents, amortization of
below-market leases, net of above-market leases and other non-cash
adjustments).  We present these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) facilitate
meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and
segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties,
and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of
our peers.  Same store EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net
income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures employed by other companies.

Below is the reconciliation of EBITDA to same
store EBITDA for each of our segments for the three months ended December 31,
2015, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2014.

Related Party Transactions

Alexander’s

We own 32.4% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, the
Chairman of our Board and Chief Executive Officer is also the Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s.  We provide various services
to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and leasing
agreements.  These agreements are described in Note 6 -

Investments in
Partially Owned Entities

to our consolidated financial statements in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

On January 15, 2015, we completed the spin-off of
79 strip shopping centers, three malls, a warehouse park and $225,000,000 of
cash to UE and the transfer of all of the employees responsible for the
management and leasing of those assets.   In addition, we entered into
agreements with UE to provide management and leasing services, on our behalf,
for Alexander’s Rego Park retail assets.  Fees for these services are similar
to the fees we are receiving from Alexander’s as described in Note 6 -

Investments
in Partially Owned Entities

to our consolidated financial statements in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Interstate
Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr.
Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and
Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of
Alexander’s, are Interstate’s two other general partners. As of December 31,
2015, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned an aggregate of
approximately 7.1% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and
26.3% of Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of
Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual
fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent.  The management
agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless
terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term. 
We believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies,
that the management agreement terms are fair to us.  We earned $541,000, $535,000,
and $606,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Property rental income is our primary
source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our
properties. Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital
improvements, tenant improvements, debt service, leasing commissions, dividends
to shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership,
as well as acquisition and development costs.    Other sources of liquidity to
fund cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including
mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, unsecured term loan and our
unsecured revolving credit facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and
preferred equity; and asset sales.

We anticipate that cash flow from
continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our
business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating
Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring
capital expenditures.  Capital requirements for development expenditures and
acquisitions may require funding from borrowings and/or equity offerings.

We may from time to time purchase or
retire outstanding debt securities.  Such purchases, if any, will depend on
prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors.  The
amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our
consolidated financial statements.

Dividends

On January 20, 2016, we declared a
quarterly common dividend of $0.63 per share (an indicated annual rate of $2.52
per common share).  This dividend, if continued for all of 2016, would require
us to pay out approximately $476,000,000 of cash for common share dividends. 
In addition, during 2016, we expect to pay approximately $82,000,000 of cash
dividends on outstanding preferred shares and approximately $32,000,000 of cash
distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership.

Financing
Activities and Contractual Obligations

We have an effective shelf registration
for the offering of our equity and debt securities that is not limited in
amount due to our status as a “well-known seasoned issuer.”  We have issued
senior unsecured notes from a shelf registration statement that contain
financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt, and that require
us to maintain a level of unencumbered assets based on the level of our secured
debt.  Our unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants
that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to
market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the
event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB.  Our unsecured revolving
credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing,
including representations and warranties, and contain customary events of
default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as
failure to pay interest or principal.  As of December 31, 2015, we are in
compliance with all of the financial covenants required by our senior unsecured
notes and our unsecured revolving credit facilities.

As of December 31, 2015, we had $1,835,707,000 of
cash and cash equivalents and $1,911,904,000 of borrowing capacity under our unsecured
revolving credit facilities, net of outstanding borrowings and letters of
credit of $550,000,000 and $38,096,000, respectively.  A summary of our
consolidated debt as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 is presented below.

Details of 2015 financing activities are provided

Conditions and Results of Operations.  Details of 2014 financing activities are
discussed below.

Secured Debt

On January 31, 2014, we completed a $600,000,000
loan secured by our 220 Central Park South development site.  The loan bears
interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% and matures in January 2016, with three one-year
extension options.

On April 16,

2014, we completed a
$350,000,000 refinancing of 909 Third Avenue, a 1.3 million square foot
Manhattan office building.  The seven-year interest only loan bears interest at
3.91% and matures in May 2021. We realized net proceeds of approximately
$145,000,000 after defeasing the existing 5.64%, $193,000,000 mortgage,
defeasance cost and other closing costs.

On August 12, 2014, we completed a $185,000,000
financing of the Universal buildings, a 690,000 square foot, two-building
office complex located in Washington, DC. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus
1.90% and matures in August 2019 with two one-year extension options. The loan
amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the fourth year.

On August 26, 2014, we obtained a standby commitment
for up to $500,000,000 of five-year mezzanine loan financing to fund a portion
of the development expenditures at 220 Central Park South.

On October 27,
2014, we completed a $140,000,000 financing of 655 Fifth Avenue, a 57,500
square foot retail and office property.  The loan is interest only at LIBOR
plus 1.40% and matures in October 2019 with two one-year extension options.

On December 8, 2014, we completed a $575,000,000
refinancing of Two Penn Plaza, a 1.6 million square foot Manhattan office
building.  The loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.65%

and matures in 2019 with two one-year extension options.  We
realized net proceeds of approximately $143,000,000.  Pursuant to an existing
swap agreement, the $422,000,000 previous loan on the property was swapped to a
fixed rate of 4.78% through March 2018.  Therefore, $422,000,000 of the new
loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.78% through March 2018 and the balance
of $153,000,000 floats through March 2018.  The entire $575,000,000 will float
thereafter for the duration of the new loan.

Senior
Unsecured Notes

On June 16,
2014, we completed a green bond public offering of $450,000,000 2.50% senior unsecured
notes due June 30, 2019. The notes were sold at 99.619% of their face amount to
yield 2.581%.

On October 1,
2014, we redeemed all of the $445,000,000 principal amount of our outstanding
7.875% senior unsecured notes, which were scheduled to mature on October 1,
2039, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued
interest through the redemption date.  In the fourth quarter of 2014, we wrote
off $12,532,000 of unamortized deferred financing costs, which are included as
a component of “interest and debt expense” on our consolidated statements of
income.

Unsecured Revolving Credit
Facilities

On September 30, 2014, we extended one of our
two $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities from November 2015 to
November 2018 with two six-month extension options.  The interest rate on the
extended facility was lowered to LIBOR plus 105 basis points from LIBOR plus
125 basis points and the facility fee was reduced to 20 basis points from 25
basis points.

Acquisitions
and Investments

Details of 2015
acquisitions and investments are provided in the “Overview” of Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. 
Details of 2014 acquisitions and investments are discussed below.

On
June 26, 2014, we invested an additional $22,700,000 to increase our ownership
in One Park Avenue to 55.0% from 46.5% through a joint venture with an
institutional investor, who increased its ownership interest to 45.0%.  The
transaction was based on a property value of $560,000,000.  The property is
encumbered by a $250,000,000 interest only mortgage loan that bears interest at
4.995% and matures in March 2016.

On August 1, 2014, we acquired the land under
our 715 Lexington Avenue retail property located on the Southeast corner of 58

th

Street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, for $63,000,000.

On October 28, 2014

, we completed the purchase of the
retail condominium of the St. Regis Hotel for $700,000,000.  We own a 74.3%
controlling interest of the joint venture which owns the property.  The
acquisition was used in a like-kind exchange for income tax purposes for the
sale of 1740 Broadway.

On November 21, 2014, we
entered into an agreement to acquire the Center Building, an eight story
437,000 square foot office building, located at 33-00 Northern Boulevard in
Long Island City, New York.  The building is 98% leased.  The purchase price is
approximately $142,000,000, including the assumption of an existing $62,000,000
4.43% mortgage maturing in October 2018.

Development and Redevelopment
Expenditures

We are
constructing a residential condominium tower containing 392,000 salable square
feet on our 220 Central Park South development site.  The incremental
development cost of this project is approximately $1.3 billion, of which $293,000,000
has been expended as of December 31, 2015.

We are
developing The Bartlett, a 699-unit residential project in Pentagon City, which
is expected to be completed in 2016.  The project includes a 40,000 square foot
Whole Foods Market at the base of the building.  The incremental development
cost of this project is approximately $250,000,000, of which $166,000,000 has
been expended as of December 31, 2015.

On June 24,
2015, we entered into a joint venture, in which we own a 55% interest, to
develop a 173,000 square foot Class-A office building, located along the
western edge of the High Line at 512 West 22nd Street in the West Chelsea
submarket of Manhattan.  The development cost of this project is approximately
$235,000,000.  On November 24, 2015, the joint venture obtained a $126,000,000
construction loan.  The loan matures in November 2019 with two six-month
extension options.  The interest rate is LIBOR plus 2.65% (3.07% at December
31, 2015).  As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance of the loan was
$44,072,000, of which $24,240,000 is our share.

On July 23, 2014, a
joint venture in which we are a 50.1% partner entered into a 99-year ground
lease for 61 Ninth Avenue located on the Southwest corner of Ninth Avenue and

th

Street in the West Chelsea submarket of Manhattan.  The
venture’s current plans are to construct an office building, with retail at the
base, of approximately 167,000 square feet.  Total development costs are
currently estimated to be approximately $150,000,000.

We plan to demolish
two adjacent Washington, DC office properties, 1726 M Street and 1150 17

th

Street in the first half of 2016 and replace them in the future with a new
335,000 square foot Class A office building, to be addressed 1700 M Street. 
The incremental development cost of the project is approximately $170,000,000.

We are also
evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our
properties in Manhattan, including the Penn Plaza District, and in Washington,
including Crystal City, Rosslyn and Pentagon City.

There can be no
assurance that any of our development or redevelopment projects will commence,
or if commenced, be completed, or completed on schedule or within budget.

Insurance

We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as flood and earthquake. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $180,000,000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. We maintain coverage for terrorism acts with limits of $4.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate, and $2.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) terrorism events, as defined by Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015, which expires in December 2020.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism including NBCR acts. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 ($2,400,000 effective January 1, 2016) per occurrence and 15% of the balance of a covered loss (16% effective January 1, 2016) and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of a covered loss (84% effective January 1, 2016). We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us.  However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space.  These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans.  As of December 31, 2015, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $427,000,000.

At December 31, 2015, $38,096,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our unsecured revolving credit facilities.  Our unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

As of December 31, 2015, we expect to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $70,000,000.

As of December 31, 2015, we have construction commitments aggregating $873,800,000.

Funds From Operations (“FFO”)

FFO is computed in
accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”).  NAREIT
defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales
of depreciated real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation
and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified non-cash
items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated
subsidiaries.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used
by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of
operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes
the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales,
which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of
real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on
existing market conditions.  FFO does not represent cash generated from
operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to
fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net
income as a performance measure or cash flows as a liquidity measure.  FFO may
not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

FFO attributable to common shareholders plus
assumed conversions was $1,039,035,000, or $5.48 per diluted share for the year
ended December 31, 2015, compared to $911,130,000, or $4.83 per diluted share
for the year ended December 31, 2014. FFO attributable to common shareholders
plus assumed conversions was $259,528,000, or $1.37 per diluted share for the
three months ended December 31, 2015, compared to $230,143,000, or $1.22 per
diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2014.  Details
of certain items that affect comparability are discussed in the financial
results summary of our “Overview.”

ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We have exposure to fluctuations in market
interest rates. Market interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are
beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest rates on our
consolidated and non-consolidated debt (all of which arises out of non-trading
activity) is as follows:

We may utilize various financial instruments to
mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and
earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the
interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. As of
December 31, 2015, we have an interest rate swap on a $417,000,000 mortgage
loan that swapped the rate from LIBOR plus 1.65% (1.89% at December 31, 2015)
to a fixed rate of 4.78% through March 2018.

In connection with the $375,000,000 refinancing
of 888 Seventh Avenue, we entered into an interest rate swap from LIBOR plus
1.60% (1.92% at December 31, 2015) to a fixed rate of 3.15% through December
2020.

Fair Value of Debt

The estimated fair value of our consolidated debt
is calculated based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at the
current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar
credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt.  As of December 31, 2015,
the estimated fair value of our consolidated debt was $10,911,500,000.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

Shareholders and Board of Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Vornado Realty Trust (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income,
comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2015. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial
statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Vornado Realty Trust at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of
accounting for and disclosure of discontinued operations for the year ended
December 31, 2015 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2014-08,
“Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components
of an Entity.”

We have also audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2015, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—

Integrated
Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated February 16, 2016 expressed an
unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

VORNADO REALTY TRUST

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    
Organization and Business

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated
real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and
substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). 
Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its
shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and
the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their
obligations to creditors.  Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned
approximately  93.7% of the common limited partnership interest in the
Operating Partnership at December 31, 2015.  All references to “we,” “us,”
“our,” the “Company” and “Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its
consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership.

On January 15, 2015, we completed the spin-off of
substantially all of our retail segment comprised of 79 strip shopping centers,
three malls, a warehouse park and $225,000,000 of cash to Urban Edge Properties
(“UE”) (NYSE: UE). As part of this transaction, we retained 5,717,184 UE
operating partnership units (5.4% ownership interest). We are providing
transition services to UE for an initial period of up to two years, primarily
for information technology support.  UE is providing us with leasing and
property management services for (i) certain small retail properties that we
plan to sell, and (ii) our affiliate, Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX) Rego Park
retail assets. Steven Roth, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is a
member of the Board of Trustees of UE. The spin-off distribution was effected
by Vornado distributing one UE common share for every two Vornado common
shares.  The historical financial results of UE are reflected in our
consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods
presented.

We currently own all or portions of:

New York:

·

21.3 million square feet of Manhattan office space in 35
properties;

·

2.6 million square feet of Manhattan street retail space in 65
properties;

·

1,711 units in eleven residential properties;

·

The 1,700 room Hotel Pennsylvania located on Seventh Avenue at 33

rd

Street in the heart of the Penn Plaza district;

·

A 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX), which owns seven
properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, including 731 Lexington
Avenue, the 1.3 million square foot Bloomberg, L.P. headquarters building;

Washington,
DC:

·

15.8 million square feet of office space in 57 properties;

·

2,414 units in seven residential properties;

The 3.6 million square foot Mart (“theMart”) in Chicago;

·

A 70% controlling interest in 555 California Street, a
three-building office complex in San Francisco’s financial district aggregating
1.8 million square feet, known as the Bank of America Center;

·

A 25.0% interest in Vornado Capital Partners, our real estate
fund.  We are the general partner and investment manager of the fund;

·

A 32.5% interest in Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”); and

·

Other real estate and other investments.


VORNADO REALTY TRUST

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

2.    Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting
Policies

Basis of
Presentation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vornado
and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership. All
inter-company amounts have been eliminated.  Our consolidated financial
statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Certain prior
year balances have been reclassified in order to conform to the current period
presentation.  Beginning in the year ended December 31, 2015, we
classified signage revenue within “property rentals”.  For the years ended
December 31, 2014 and 2013, $37,929,000 and $32,866,000, respectively, related
to signage revenue has been reclassified from “fee and other income” to
“property rentals” to conform to the current period presentation.

On January 15,
2015, we completed the spin-off of substantially all of our retail segment
comprised of 79 strip shopping centers, three malls, a warehouse park and $225,000,000
of cash to UE.  As part of this transaction, we received 5,717,184 UE operating
partnership units (5.4% ownership interest).

Recently Issued Accounting
Literature

In April 2014,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an update (“ASU
2014-08”)

Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of
Components of an Entity

to ASC Topic 205,

Presentation of Financial
Statements

and ASC Topic 360,

Property Plant and Equipment.

Under
ASU 2014-08, only disposals that represent a strategic shift that has (or will
have) a major effect on the entity’s results and operations would qualify as
discontinued operations. In addition, ASU 2014-08 expands the disclosure
requirements for disposals that meet the definition of a discontinued operation
and requires entities to disclose information about disposals of individually
significant components that do not meet the definition of discontinued
operations. ASU 2014-08 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods
in fiscal years that began after December 15, 2014. Upon adoption of this
standard on January 1, 2015, individual properties sold in the ordinary course
of business are not expected to qualify as discontinued operations. Under ASU
2014-08, operating results of disposals are included in income from continuing
operations, and any associated gains are now included in “net gain on
disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets” on our consolidated statements
of income. Gain on sales of properties classified as discontinued operations
prior to January 1, 2015 are classified in “income from discontinued
operations” on our consolidated statements of income. The financial results of
UE and certain other retail assets are reflected in our consolidated financial
statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented (see Note 7 –

Dispositions

for further details).

In May 2014,
the FASB issued an update ("ASU 2014-09") establishing ASC Topic 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

.  ASU 2014-09 establishes a single
comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from
contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue
recognition guidance.  ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue when
it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for
those goods or services and also requires certain additional disclosures.  ASU
2014-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years
that begin after December 15, 2017.  We are currently evaluating the impact of
the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2014,
the FASB issued an update (“ASU 2014-12”) to ASC Topic 718,

Compensation –
Stock Compensation

.  ASU 2014-12 requires an entity to treat performance
targets that can be met after the requisite service period of a share based
award has ended, as a performance condition that affects vesting.  ASU 2014-12
is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that
begin after December 15, 2015.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the
adoption of ASU 2014-12 on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2015, the FASB issued an update (“ASU 2015-02”)

Amendments
to the Consolidation Analysis

to ASC Topic 810,

Consolidation

.  ASU
2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they
should consolidate certain legal entities.  Specifically, the amendments: (i)
modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal
entities are variable interest entities ("VIEs") or voting interest
entities, (ii) eliminate the presumption that a general partner should
consolidate a limited partnership, (iii) affect the consolidation analysis of
reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, and (iv) provide a scope
exception for certain entities.  ASU 2015-02 is effective for interim and
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  We are currently
evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-02 on our consolidated
financial statements.

In April 2015,
the FASB issued an update (“ASU 2015-03”)

Simplifying the Presentation of
Debt Issuance Costs

to ASC Topic 835,

Interest

(“ASC 835”).  ASU
2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as
a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability to which they
relate, consistent with debt discounts, as opposed to being presented as
assets.  ASU 2015-03 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.  We elected to early adopt ASU
2015-03 effective as of December 31, 2015 with retrospective application to our
December 31, 2014 consolidating balance sheet.  The effect of the adoption of
ASU 2015-03 was to reclassify debt issuance costs of approximately $79,987,000
as of December 31, 2014 from “deferred leasing and financing costs, net” to a contra
account as a deduction from the related debt liabilities.  There was no effect
on our consolidated statements of income.

In August 2015,
the FASB issued an update (“ASU 2015-15”)

Interest – Imputation of Interest

to ASC 835.  For debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements,
ASU 2015-15 allows entities to present debt issuance costs as an asset and
subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of
the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding
borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.  We elected to early adopt ASU
2015-15 effective as of December 31, 2015 with retrospective application to our
December 31, 2014 balance sheet.  These debt issuance costs were $7,720,000 and
$11,549,000 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included as
a component of “other assets”.

In January 2016, the FASB issued an update (“ASU
2016-01”)

Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities

to ASC Topic 825,

Financial Instruments

(“ASC
825”).  ASU 2016-01 amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of financial instruments, including the requirement
to measure certain equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value
recognized in net income.  ASU 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual
reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  We
are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on our consolidated
financial statements.

Real
Estate:

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly
related to the improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized.
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. For redevelopment of existing
operating properties, the net book value of the existing property under
redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in
connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized
costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped
property when complete. If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the
net book value of the existing property, exceeds the estimated fair value of
redeveloped property, the excess is charged to expense. Depreciation is recognized
on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40
years. Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives
of the related leases, which approximate the useful lives of the assets.
Additions to real estate include interest and debt expense capitalized during
construction of $59,305,000 and $62,786,000 for the years ended December 31,
2015 and 2014, respectively.

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess
the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified
intangibles, such as acquired above and below-market leases, acquired in-place
leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and we allocate the
purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on
estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and
capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future
cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating
results, known trends, and market/economic conditions.  We record acquired
intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases, acquired in-place
leases and tenant relationships) and acquired intangible liabilities (including
below–market leases) at their estimated fair value separate and apart from
goodwill. We amortize identified intangibles that have finite lives over the
period they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future
cash flows of the property or business acquired.

Our properties, including any related intangible
assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists
when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future
cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis.  An
impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying
amount over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on our
current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the
time the analyses are prepared.  If our estimates of the projected future cash
flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change, our evaluation
of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to
our consolidated financial statements.  The evaluation of anticipated cash
flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future
occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially
from actual results.  Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the
likelihood of recording impairment losses.

Partially Owned Entities:

We
consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest.  In
determining whether we have a controlling financial interest in a partially
owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we
consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management
representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive
participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a
variable interest entity (“VIE”) and we are the primary beneficiary.  We are
deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have (i) the power to
direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s
economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive
benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We generally do not
control a partially owned entity if the entity is not considered a VIE and the
approval of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect
to major decisions, such as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange
or other disposition of real property, the hiring of a chief executive officer,
the commencement, compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or
arbitration or the placement of new or additional financing secured by assets
of the venture.  We account for investments under the equity method when the
requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence
over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially
recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss
and cash contributions and distributions each period. Investments that do not
qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the
cost method.

Investments in partially owned entities are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured
based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated
fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding
periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared.  In
the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized non-cash impairment
losses on investments in partially owned entities aggregating $85,459,000 and
$281,098,000, respectively.  Included in these amounts are $75,196,000 and
$240,757,000 of impairment losses related to our investment in Toys in 2014 and
2013, respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less and are carried at cost, which approximates
fair value due to their short-term maturities.  The majority of our cash and
cash equivalents consists of (i) deposits at major commercial banks, which may
at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit, (ii) United
States Treasury Bills, and (iii) Certificate of Deposits placed through an
Account Registry Service (“CDARS”).  To date, we have not experienced any
losses on our invested cash.

Restricted Cash:

Restricted cash consists of security deposits, cash restricted for the purposes
of facilitating a Section 1031 Like-Kind exchange, cash restricted in
connection with our deferred compensation plan and cash escrowed under loan
agreements for debt service, real estate taxes, property insurance and capital
improvements.

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts:

We periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from
tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the
lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from
the straight-lining of rents. This receivable arises from earnings recognized
in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management
exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment
history and current credit status in developing these estimates.  As of
December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $11,908,000 and $12,210,000, respectively,
in allowances for doubtful accounts. In addition, as of December 31, 2015 and
2014, we had $2,751,000 and $3,188,000, respectively, in allowances for
receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents.

Deferred Charges:

Direct
financing costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related
agreements as a component of interest expense. Direct costs related to
successful leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a straight line
basis over the lives of the related leases. All other deferred charges are
amortized on a straight line basis, which approximates the effective interest
rate method, in accordance with the terms of the agreements to which they
relate.

Revenue Recognition:

We have the following revenue
sources and revenue recognition policies:

•      Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases. These
rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a
straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements
under the leases.  We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes
possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for
its intended use.  In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant
improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we
recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line
basis over the term of the lease.

•      Percentage Rent — income arising from retail tenant
leases that is contingent upon tenant sales exceeding defined thresholds. These
rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., when
tenant sales thresholds have been achieved).

•      Hotel Revenue — income arising from the operation of
the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage
revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied.
Food and beverage and banquet revenue is recognized when the services have been
rendered.

•      Trade Shows Revenue — income arising from the
operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is
recognized when the trade shows have occurred.

•      Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant
leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses
and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in
the same periods as the expenses are incurred.

•      Management, Leasing and Other Fees — income arising
from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned
entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed
under the respective agreements.

Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities:

ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, as amended,
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our derivative instruments
consisted of two and one interest rate swaps, respectively.  We record all
derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in
the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and
the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in
the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a
particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash
flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow
hedges.

For derivatives designated as
fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged
item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives
designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair
value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income
(loss) (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the
hedged transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in
the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings. We assess
the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair
value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in
fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction. For
derivatives not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in
earnings.

Income Taxes:

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856‑860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.  Dividends distributed for the year ended December 31, 2015, were characterized, for federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain income.  Dividends distributed for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, were characterized, for federal income tax purposes, as ordinary income.

We have elected to treat certain consolidated subsidiaries, and may in the future elect to treat newly formed subsidiaries, as taxable REIT subsidiaries pursuant to an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code that became effective January 1, 2001.  Taxable REIT subsidiaries may participate in non-real estate related activities and/or perform non-customary services for tenants and are subject to Federal and State income tax at regular corporate tax rates. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries had a combined current income tax expense of approximately $8,322,000, $10,777,000 and $9,608,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and have immaterial differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014,

our taxable REIT subsidiaries had deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards of

$97,104,000 and $94,100,000, respectively,

which are included in “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets.  Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2015, there was a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets because we had not determined that it is more-likely-than-not that we would use the net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income.  In our quarter ended June 30, 2015, based upon residential condominium unit sales, among other factors, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets.  Accordingly, we reversed $90,030,000 of the allowance for deferred tax assets and recognized an income tax benefit in our consolidated statements of income.

The following table reconciles net income attributable to common shareholders to estimated taxable income for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

3.     Real Estate Fund Investments

We are the general partner and investment manager of Vornado Capital Partners Real Estate Fund (the “Fund”), which has an eight-year term and a three-year investment period

that ended in July 2013. During the investment period, the Fund was our exclusive investment vehicle for all investments that fit within its investment parameters, as defined.

The Fund is accounted for under ASC 946,

Financial Services – Investment Companies

(“ASC 946”) and its investments are reported on its balance sheet at fair value, with changes in value each period recognized in earnings. We consolidate the accounts of the Fund into our consolidated financial statements, retaining the fair value basis of accounting.

On June 26, 2014, the Fund sold its 64.7% interest in One Park Avenue to a newly formed joint venture that we and an institutional investor own 55% and 45%, respectively.  This transaction was based on a property value of $560,000,000.  From the inception of this investment through its disposition, the Fund realized a $75,529,000 net gain.

On August 21, 2014, the Fund and its 50% joint venture partner completed the sale of The Shops at Georgetown Park, a 305,000 square foot retail property, for $272,500,000. From the inception of this investment through its disposition, the Fund realized a $51,124,000 net gain.

On January 20, 2015, we co-invested with the Fund and one of the Fund’s limited partners to buy out the Fund’s joint venture partner’s 57% interest in the Crowne Plaza Times Square Hotel (the “Co-Investment”).  The purchase price for the 57% interest was approximately $95,000,000 (our share $39,000,000) which valued the property at approximately $480,000,000.  The property is encumbered by a $310,000,000 mortgage loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.80% and maturing in December 2018 with a one-year extension option.   Our aggregate ownership interest in the property increased to 33% from 11%.  The Co-Investment is also accounted for under ASC 946 and is included as a component of “real estate fund investments” on our consolidated balance sheet.

On March 25, 2015, the Fund completed the sale of 520 Broadway in Santa Monica, CA for $91,650,000. The Fund realized a $23,768,000 net gain over the holding period.

At December 31, 2015, we

had six real estate fund investments with an aggregate fair value of $574,761,000, or $208,614,000 in excess of cost, and had remaining unfunded commitments of $102,212,000, of which our share was $25,553,000.  At December 31, 2014, we had seven real estate fund investments with an aggregate fair value of $513,973,000.

4.     Acquisitions

On January 20, 2015, we and one of our real estate fund’s limited partners co-invested with the Fund to buy out the Fund’s joint venture partner’s 57% interest in the Crowne Plaza Times Square Hotel (see Note 3 –

Real Estate Fund Investments

).

On March 18, 2015, we acquired the Center Building, a 437,000 square foot office building, located at 33-00 Northern Boulevard in Long Island City, New York, for $142,000,000, including the assumption of an existing $62,000,000, 4.43% mortgage maturing in October 2018.

On June 2, 2015, we completed the acquisition of 150 West 34th Street, a 78,000 square foot retail property leased to Old Navy through May 2019, and 226,000 square feet of additional zoning air rights, for approximately $355,000,000.  At closing we completed a $205,000,000 financing of the property (see Note 9 –

Debt

).

On July 31, 2015, we acquired 260 Eleventh Avenue, a 235,000 square foot office property leased to the City of New York through 2021 with two five-year renewal options, a 10,000 square foot parking lot and additional air rights.  The transaction is structured as a 99-year ground lease with an option to purchase the land for $110,000,000.  The $3,900,000 annual ground rent and the purchase option price escalate annually at the lesser of 1.5% or CPI.  The buildings were purchased for 813,900 newly issued Vornado Operating Partnership units valued at approximately $80,000,000.

On September 25, 2015, we acquired 265 West 34th Street, a 1,700 square foot retail property and 15,200 square feet of additional zoning air rights, for approximately $28,500,000.

5.    Marketable Securities and Derivative Instruments

Our portfolio of marketable securities is comprised of equity securities that are classified as available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale securities are presented on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses resulting from the mark-to-market of these securities are included in “other comprehensive income (loss).”  Realized gains and losses are recognized in earnings only upon the sale of the securities and are recorded based on the weighted average cost of such securities.

We evaluate our portfolio of marketable securities for impairment each reporting period.  For each of the securities in our portfolio with unrealized losses, we review the underlying cause of the decline in value and the estimated recovery period, as well as the severity and duration of the decline.  In our evaluation, we consider our ability and intent to hold these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for us to recover our cost basis.  We also evaluate the near-term prospects for each of these investments in relation to the severity and duration of the decline.

Below is a summary of our marketable securities portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.

6.    Investments in Partially Owned Entities

Toys “R” Us (“Toys”)

As of December 31, 2015, we own 32.5% of Toys.  We
account for our investment in Toys under the equity method and record our share
of Toys’ net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because Toys’ fiscal
year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, and our fiscal year ends on
December 31.  The business of Toys is highly seasonal and substantially all of
Toys’ net income is generated in its fourth quarter.

We have not
guaranteed any of Toys’ obligations and are not committed to provide any
support to Toys.  Pursuant to ASC 323-10-35-20, we discontinued applying
the equity method for our Toys’ investment when the carrying amount was reduced
to zero in the third quarter of 2014.  We will resume application of the equity
method if, during the period the equity method was suspended, our share of
unrecognized net income exceeds our share of unrecognized net losses.

In the first
quarter of 2014, we recognized our share of Toys’ fourth quarter net income of
$75,196,000 and a corresponding non-cash impairment loss of the same amount. 
In 2013, we recognized $240,757,000 of non-cash impairment losses based on an
“other-than-temporary” decline in the fair value of our investment.

Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”)
(NYSE: ALX)

As of December 31, 2015, we own 1,654,068
Alexander’s common shares, or approximately 32.4% of Alexander’s common
equity.  We manage, lease and develop Alexander’s properties pursuant to
agreements which expire in March of each year and are automatically renewable.

As of December 31, 2015 the market value (“fair
value” pursuant to ASC 820) of our investment in Alexander’s, based on
Alexander’s December 31, 2015 closing share price of $384.11, was $635,345,000,
or $501,777,000 in excess of the carrying amount on our consolidated balance
sheet.  As of December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of our investment in
Alexander’s, excluding amounts owed to us, exceeds our share of the equity in
the net assets of Alexander’s by approximately $40,340,000.  The majority of
this basis difference resulted from the excess of our purchase price for the
Alexander’s common stock acquired over the book value of Alexander’s net
assets.  Substantially all of this basis difference was allocated, based on our
estimates of the fair values of Alexander’s assets and liabilities, to real
estate (land and buildings).  We are amortizing the basis difference related to
the buildings into earnings as additional depreciation expense over their
estimated useful lives.  This depreciation is not material to our share of
equity in Alexander’s net income.  The basis difference related to the land
will be recognized upon disposition of our investment.

Management, Leasing and Development Agreements

We receive an annual fee for managing Alexander’s
and all of its properties equal to the sum of (i) $2,800,000, (ii) 2% of
the gross revenue from the Rego Park II Shopping Center, (iii) $0.50 per square
foot of the tenant-occupied office and retail space at 731 Lexington Avenue,
and (iv) $289,000, escalating at 3% per annum, for managing the common area of
731 Lexington Avenue.  In addition, we are entitled to a development fee of 6%
of development costs, as defined.

We provide Alexander’s with leasing services for
a fee of 3% of rent for the first ten years of a lease term, 2% of rent for the
eleventh through twentieth year of a lease term and 1% of rent for the
twenty-first through thirtieth year of a lease term, subject to the payment of
rents by Alexander’s tenants.  In the event third-party real estate brokers are
used, our fee increases by 1% and we are responsible for the fees to the
third-parties.  We are also entitled to a commission upon the sale of any of

Urban Edge Properties (“UE”) (NYSE: UE)

As part of our spin-off of substantially all of
our retail segment to UE on January 15, 2015 (see Note 1 –

Organization and
Business

), we retained 5,717,184 UE operating partnership units, representing

a 5.4% ownership

interest in UE.  We account
for our investment in UE under the equity method and record our share of UE’s
net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis.  We are providing transition
services to UE for an initial period of up to two years, primarily for
information technology support.  UE is providing us with leasing and property
management services for (i) certain small retail properties that we plan to
sell, and (ii) our affiliate, Alexander’s, Rego Park retail assets.  As of December
31, 2015, the fair value of our investment in UE, based on UE’s December 31,
2015 closing share price of $23.45, was $134,068,000, or $108,717,000 in excess
of the carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet.

Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (“PREIT”)
(NYSE: PEI)

On March 31, 2015, we transferred the
redeveloped Springfield Town Center, a 1,350,000 square foot mall located in
Springfield, Fairfax County, Virginia, to PREIT Associates, L.P., which is the
operating partnership of PREIT, in exchange for $485,313,000; comprised of
$340,000,000 of cash and 6,250,000 PREIT operating partnership units (valued at
$145,313,000 or $23.25 per PREIT unit) (See Note 7 –

Dispositions

). 
$19,000,000 of tenant improvements and allowances was credited to PREIT as a
closing adjustment.  As a result of this transaction, we own an 8.1% interest
in PREIT.  We account for our investment in PREIT under the equity method and record
our share of PREIT’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis.  As of
December 31, 2015, the fair value of our investment in PREIT, based on PREIT’s
December 31, 2015 closing share price of $21.87, was $136,688,000, or
$3,313,000 in excess of the carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet. 
As of December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of our investment in PREIT exceeds
our share of the equity in the net assets of PREIT by approximately $65,404,000. 
The majority of this basis difference resulted from the excess of the fair
value of the PREIT operating units received over our share of the book value of
PREIT’s net assets.  Substantially all of this basis difference was allocated,
based on our estimates of the fair values of PREIT’s assets and liabilities, to
real estate (land and buildings).  We are amortizing the basis difference
related to the buildings into earnings as additional depreciation expense over
their estimated useful lives.  This depreciation is not material to our share
of equity in PREIT’s net loss.  The basis difference related to the land will
be recognized upon disposition of our investment.

On June 24,
2015, we entered into a joint venture, in which we own a 55% interest, to

31, 2015, the outstanding balance of the loan was $44,072,000, of which
$24,240,000 is our share.  We account for our investment in the joint venture
under the equity method.

Secured Debt

On April 1, 2015, we completed a $308,000,000
refinancing of RiverHouse Apartments, a three building, 1,670 unit rental
complex located in Arlington, VA.  The loan is interest only at LIBOR plus
1.28% (1.52% at December 31, 2015) and matures in 2025.  We realized net
proceeds of approximately $43,000,000.  The property was previously encumbered
by a 5.43%, $195,000,000 mortgage maturing in April 2015 and a $64,000,000
mortgage at LIBOR plus 1.53% maturing in 2018.

On June 2, 2015, we completed a $205,000,000
financing in connection with the acquisition of 150 West 34

th

Street
(see Note 4 –

Acquisitions

).  The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus
2.25% (2.52% at December 31, 2015) and matures in 2018 with two one-year
extension options.

On July 28, 2015, we completed a $580,000,000
refinancing of 100 West 33rd Street, a 1.1 million square foot property
comprised of 855,000 square feet of office space and the 256,000 square foot
Manhattan Mall.  The loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.65% (1.92% at
December 31, 2015) and matures in July 2020.  We realized net proceeds of
approximately $242,000,000.

On September 22, 2015, we upsized the loan on
our 220 Central Park South development by $350,000,000 to $950,000,000.  The
interest rate on the loan is LIBOR plus 2.00% (2.42% at December 31, 2015) and
the final maturity date is 2020.  In connection with the upsizing, the standby
commitment for a $500,000,000 mezzanine loan for this development has been
terminated by payment of a $15,000,000 contractual termination fee, which was
capitalized as a component of “development costs and construction in progress”
on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.

On December 11,
2015, we completed a $375,000,000 refinancing of 888 Seventh Avenue, a 882,000
square foot Manhattan office building.  The five-year loan is interest only at
LIBOR plus 1.60% (1.92% at December 31, 2015) which was swapped for the term of
the loan to a fixed rate of 3.15% and matures in December 2020.  We realized
net proceeds of approximately $49,000,000.

On December 21,
2015, we completed a $450,000,000 financing of the retail condominium of the St.
Regis Hotel and the adjacent retail town house located on Fifth Avenue at 55th
Street.  The loan matures in December 2020, with two one-year extension
options.  The loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.80% (2.19% at December 31,
2015) for the first three years, LIBOR plus 1.90% for years four and five, and
LIBOR plus 2.00% during the extension periods.  We own a 74.3% controlling
interest in the joint venture which owns the property.

Senior Unsecured Notes

On January 1, 2015, we
redeemed all of the $500,000,000 principal amount of our outstanding 4.25%
senior unsecured notes, which were scheduled to mature on April 1, 2015, at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest through
December 31, 2014.

Unsecured Term Loan

On October 30,
2015, we entered into an unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility in the
maximum amount of $750,000,000.  The facility matures in October 2018 with two
one-year extension options.  The interest rate is LIBOR plus 1.15% (1.40% at
December 31, 2015) with a fee of 0.20% per annum on the unused portion.  At
closing, we drew $187,500,000.  The facility provides that the maximum amount
available is twice the amount outstanding on April 29, 2016, limited to
$750,000,000, and all draws must be made by October 2017.  This facility, together
with the $950,000,000 development loan mentioned above, provides the funding
for our 220 Central Park South development.

10.    Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Redeemable noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheets are primarily comprised of Class A Operating Partnership units held by third parties and  are recorded at the greater of their carrying amount or redemption value at the end of each reporting period.  Changes in the value from period to period are charged to “additional capital” in our consolidated statements of changes in equity.  Class A units may be tendered for redemption to the Operating Partnership for cash; we, at our option, may assume that obligation and pay the holder either cash or Vornado common shares on a one-for-one basis.  Because the number of Vornado common shares outstanding at all times equals the number of Class A units owned by Vornado, the redemption value of each Class A unit is equivalent to the market value of one Vornado common share, and the quarterly distribution to a Class A unitholder is equal to the quarterly dividend paid to a Vornado common shareholder.

13.  Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820 defines fair value and establishes a
framework for measuring fair value.  The objective of fair value is to
determine the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date (the exit price).

ASC 820 establishes a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure
fair value into three levels: Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities;
Level 2 – observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active
markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3 – unobservable inputs
that are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value
hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority
to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques
that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs to the extent possible, as well as consider counterparty credit risk in
our assessment of fair value.  Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret
Level 2 and 3 inputs in determining the fair value of our financial and
non-financial assets and liabilities.  Accordingly, our fair value estimates,
which are made at the end of each reporting period, may be different than the
amounts that may ultimately be realized upon sale or disposition of these
assets.

Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at
Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Financial assets and liabilities that are
measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets consist of (i)
marketable securities, (ii) real estate fund investments, (iii) the assets in
our deferred compensation plan (for which there is a corresponding liability on
our consolidated balance sheet), (iv) mandatorily redeemable instruments
(Series G-1 through G-4 convertible preferred units and Series D-13 cumulative
redeemable preferred units), and (v) interest rate swaps.  The tables below
aggregate the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities by their
levels in the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2015 and 2014,

Real Estate Fund
Investments

At December 31,
2015, we had six real estate fund investments with an aggregate fair value of $574,761,000,
or $208,614,000 in excess of cost.  These investments are classified as Level
3.  We use a discounted cash flow valuation technique to estimate the fair
value of each of these investments, which is updated quarterly by personnel
responsible for the management of each investment and reviewed by senior
management at each reporting period.  The discounted cash flow valuation technique
requires us to estimate cash flows for each investment over the anticipated
holding period, which currently ranges from 1.0 to 5.0 years.  Cash flows are
derived from property rental revenue (base rents plus reimbursements) less
operating expenses, real estate taxes and capital and other costs, plus
projected sales proceeds in the year of exit.  Property rental revenue is based
on leases currently in place and our estimates for future leasing activity,
which are based on current market rents for similar space plus a projected
growth factor.  Similarly, estimated operating expenses and real estate taxes
are based on amounts incurred in the current period plus a projected growth
factor for future periods.  Anticipated sales proceeds at the end of an
investment’s expected holding period are determined based on the net cash flow
of the investment in the year of exit, divided by a terminal capitalization
rate, less estimated selling costs.

The fair value
of each property is calculated by discounting the future cash flows (including
the projected sales proceeds), using an appropriate discount rate and then
reduced by the property’s outstanding debt, if any, to determine the fair value
of the equity in each investment. Significant unobservable quantitative inputs
used in determining the fair value of each investment include capitalization rates
and discount rates.  These rates are based on the location, type and nature of
each property, and current and anticipated market conditions, industry
publications and from the experience of our Acquisitions and Capital Markets
departments.  Significant unobservable quantitative inputs in the table below
were utilized in determining the fair value of these real estate fund
investments at December 31, 2015.

Discount rates

12.0% to 14.9%

Terminal capitalization rates

The
above inputs are subject to change based on changes in economic and market
conditions and/or changes in use or timing of exit.  Changes in discount rates
and terminal capitalization rates result in increases or decreases in the fair
values of these investments.  The discount rates encompass, among other things,
uncertainties in the valuation models with respect to terminal capitalization
rates and the amount and timing of cash flows.  Therefore, a change in the fair
value of these investments resulting from a change in the terminal
capitalization rate, may be partially offset by a change in the discount rate. 
It is not possible for us to predict the effect of future economic or market
conditions on our estimated fair values.

Deferred
Compensation Plan Assets

Deferred compensation
plan assets that are classified as Level 3 consist of investments in limited
partnerships and investment funds, which are managed by third parties.  We
receive quarterly financial reports from a third-party administrator, which are
compiled from the quarterly reports provided to them from each limited
partnership and investment fund.  The quarterly reports provide net asset
values on a fair value basis which are audited by independent public accounting
firms on an annual basis.  The third-party administrator does not adjust these
values in determining our share of the net assets and we do not adjust these
values when reported in our consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Measurements on a Nonrecurring
Basis

Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis on our consolidated balance sheets consist primarily of real estate
assets required to be measured for impairment at December 31, 2014.  There are
no assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2015. 
The fair values of real estate assets required to be measured for impairment
were determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including (i)
discounted cash flow analysis, which considers, among other things, leasing
assumptions, growth rates, discount rates and terminal capitalization rates,
(ii) income capitalization approach, which considers prevailing market
capitalization rates, and (iii) comparable sales activity.

13.  Fair Value Measurements – continued

Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured
at Fair Value

Financial assets and liabilities that are not
measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets include cash
equivalents (primarily money market funds, which invest in obligations of the
United States government), mezzanine loan receivable and our secured and unsecured
debt.  Estimates of the fair value of these instruments are determined by the
standard practice of modeling the contractual cash flows required under the
instrument and discounting them back to their present value at the appropriate
current risk adjusted interest rate, which is provided by a third-party
specialist.  For floating rate debt, we use forward rates derived from
observable market yield curves to project the expected cash flows we would be
required to make under the instrument.  The fair value of cash equivalents and
borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and unsecured term
loan are classified as Level 1, and the fair value of our mezzanine loan
receivable as of December 31, 2014 is classified as Level 3.  There are no
mezzanine loans outstanding as of December 31, 2015.  The fair value of our
secured and unsecured debt is classified as Level 2.  The table below
summarizes the carrying amounts and fair value of these financial instruments
as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.

14.    Stock-based Compensation

Our Omnibus Share
Plan (the “Plan”), which was approved in May 2010, provides the Compensation
Committee of the Board (the “Committee”) the ability to grant incentive and
non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted Operating Partnership
units and out-performance plan awards to certain of our employees and
officers.  Under the Plan, awards may be granted up to a maximum of 6,000,000
shares, if all awards granted are Full Value Awards, as defined, and up to
12,000,000 shares, if all of the awards granted are Not Full Value Awards, as
defined, plus shares in respect of awards forfeited after May 2010 that were
issued pursuant to our 2002 Omnibus Share Plan.  Full Value Awards are awards
of securities, such as restricted shares, that, if all vesting requirements are
met, do not require the payment of an exercise price or strike price to acquire
the securities.  Not Full Value Awards are awards of securities, such as
options, that do require the payment of an exercise price or strike price. 
This means, for example, if the Committee were to award only restricted shares,
it could award up to 6,000,000 restricted shares.  On the other hand, if the
Committee were to award only stock options, it could award options to purchase
up to 12,000,000 shares (at the applicable exercise price).  The Committee may
also issue any combination of awards under the Plan, with reductions in
availability of future awards made in accordance with the above limitations. 
As of December 31, 2015, we have approximately 3,570,000 shares available for
future grants under the Plan, if all awards granted are Full Value Awards, as
defined.

In the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and
2013, we recognized an aggregate of $39,846,000, $36,641,000 and $34,914,000,
respectively, of stock-based compensation expense, which is included as a
component of “general and administrative” expenses on our consolidated
statements of income.

The year ended December 31,
2015 includes $7,834,000 from the acceleration of the recognition of
compensation expense related to 2013-2015 Out-Performance Plans due to the
modification of the vesting criteria of awards such that they will fully vest
at age 65. The accelerated expense will result in lower general and
administrative expense for 2016 of $3,679,000 and $4,155,000 thereafter.

The
details of the various components of our stock-based compensation are discussed
below.

Out-Performance Plans (“the
OPPs”)

OPPs are multi-year, performance-based equity
compensation plans under which participants, including our Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, have the opportunity to earn a class of units (“OPP units”)
of the Operating Partnership if, and only if, we outperform a predetermined
total shareholder return (“TSR”) and/or outperform the market with respect to a
relative TSR in any year during the requisite performance periods as described
below.  OPP units, if earned, become convertible into Class A common units of
the Operating Partnership (and ultimately into shares) following vesting.

Awards under the 2012 and 2013 OPP have been earned. 
Awards under the 2014 and 2015 OPP may be earned if we (i) achieve a TSR level
greater than 7% per annum, or 21% over the three-year performance measurement
periods (the “Absolute Component”), and/or (ii) achieve a TSR above that of the
Index over the three-year performance measurement periods (the “Relative
Component”).  To the extent awards would be earned under the Absolute Component
of each of the OPPs, but we underperform the Index, such awards would be
reduced (and potentially fully negated) based on the degree to which we
underperform the Index.  In certain circumstances, in the event we
outperform the Index but awards would not otherwise be fully earned under the
Absolute Component, awards may still be earned or increased under the Relative
Component.  To the extent awards would otherwise be earned under the
Relative Component but we fail to achieve at least a 6% per annum absolute TSR,
such awards earned under the Relative Component would be reduced based on our
absolute TSR, with no awards being earned in the event our TSR during the
applicable measurement period is 0% or negative, irrespective of the degree to
which we may outperform the Index.  Dividends on awards issued accrue
during the performance period.

If the designated performance objectives are
achieved, OPP units are subject to time-based vesting requirements. Awards
earned under the OPPs vest 33% in year three, 33% in year four and 34% in year
five.  Our executive officers (for the purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange
Act) are required to hold earned 2013, 2014 and 2015 OPP awards for one year
following vesting.

Below is the summary of the OPP units earned through
December 31, 2015 and the aggregate grant date notional and fair values.

  the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $15,531,000,
  $6,185,000 and $3,226,000, respectively, of compensation expense related to
  OPPs.  As of December 31, 2015, there was $5,087,000 of total unrecognized
  compensation cost related to the OPPs, which will be recognized over a
  weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted at an exercise price
equal to the average of the high and low market price of our common shares on
the NYSE on the date of grant, generally vest over four years and expire 10
years from the date of grant.  Compensation expense related to stock option
awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  In the
years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $1,298,000,
$4,550,000 and $8,234,000, respectively, of compensation expense related to
stock options that vested during each year.  As of December 31, 2015, there was
$1,325,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock
options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7

19.  Leases

As lessor:

We lease space to tenants under operating leases.
Most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base rentals payable
monthly in advance. Office building leases generally require the tenants to
reimburse us for operating costs and real estate taxes above their base year
costs. Shopping center leases provide for pass-through to tenants the tenant’s
share of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance. Shopping center leases
also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rent based on a percentage
of the tenants’ sales. As of December 31, 2015, future base rental revenue
under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding rents for leases with an
original term of less than one year and rents resulting from the exercise of
renewal options, are as follows:

We
are also a lessee under a capital lease under which we will redevelop the
retail and signage components of the Marriott Marquis Times Square Hotel.  The lease
has put/call options, which if exercised would lead to our ownership. 
Capitalized leases are recorded at the present value of future minimum lease
payments or the fair market value of the property.  Capitalized leases are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset or

20.  Multiemployer
Benefit Plans

Our subsidiaries make contributions to
certain multiemployer defined benefit plans (“Multiemployer Pension Plans”) and
health plans (“Multiemployer Health Plans”) for our union represented
employees, pursuant to the respective collective bargaining agreements.

Multiemployer
Pension Plans

Multiemployer Pension Plans differ from
single-employer pension plans in that (i) contributions to multiemployer plans
may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers
and (ii) if other participating employers fail to make their contributions,
each of our participating subsidiaries may be required to bear its then pro
rata share of unfunded obligations.  If a participating subsidiary withdraws
from a plan in which it participates, it may be subject to a withdrawal
liability.  As of December 31, 2015, our subsidiaries’ participation
in these plans was not significant to our consolidated financial statements.

In the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014
and 2013, our subsidiaries contributed $10,878,000, $11,431,000 and $10,223,000,
respectively, towards Multiemployer Pension Plans, which is included as a
component of “operating” expenses on our consolidated statements of income. 
Our subsidiaries’ contributions did not represent more than 5% of total employer
contributions in any of these plans for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014
and 2013.

Multiemployer
Health Plans

Multiemployer Health Plans in which our
subsidiaries participate provide health benefits to eligible active and retired
employees.  In the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our
subsidiaries contributed $29,269,000, $29,073,000 and $26,262,000, respectively,
towards these plans, which is included as a component of “operating” expenses
on our consolidated statements of income.

21.  Commitments and Contingencies

Insurance

We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as flood and earthquake. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $180,000,000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. We maintain coverage for terrorism acts with limits of $4.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate, and $2.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) terrorism events, as defined by Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015, which expires in December 2020.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism including NBCR acts. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 ($2,400,000 effective January 1, 2016) per occurrence and 15% of the balance of a covered loss (16% effective January 1, 2016) and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of a covered loss (84% effective January 1, 2016). We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us.  However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space.  These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans.  As of December 31, 2015, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $427,000,000.

At December 31, 2015, $38,096,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our unsecured revolving credit facilities.  Our unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

As of December 31, 2015, w

e expect to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating

approximately $70,000,000.

As of December 31, 2015, we have construction commitments aggregating $873,800,000.

22.  Related Party Transactions

Alexander’s

We own 32.4% of Alexander’s.
Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board and Chief Executive Officer is also the
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s.  We provide
various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and
leasing agreements.  These agreements are described in Note 6 -

Investments
in Partially Owned Entities

.

On January 15,
2015, we completed the spin-off of 79 strip shopping centers, three malls, a
warehouse park and $225,000,000 of cash to UE and the transfer of all of the
employees responsible for the management and leasing of those assets.   In
addition, we entered into agreements with UE to provide management and leasing
services, on our behalf, for Alexander’s Rego Park retail assets.   Fees for
these services are similar to the fees we are receiving from Alexander’s as
described in Note 6 -

Investments in Partially Owned Entities

.

Interstate Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr.
Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and
Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of
Alexander’s, are Interstate’s two other general partners. As of December 31,
2015, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned an aggregate of
approximately 7.1% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and
26.3% of Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of
Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual
fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent.  The management
agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless
terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term. 
We believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies,
that the management agreement terms are fair to us.  We earned $541,000, $535,000,
and $606,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

24.   
Segment Information

As
a result of the spin-off of substantially all of our Retail Properties segment
(see Note 7 –

Dispositions

), the remaining retail properties no longer
meet the criteria to be a separate reportable segment.  In addition, as a
result of our investment in Toys being reduced to zero, we suspended equity
method accounting for our investment in Toys (see Note 6 –

Investments in
Partially Owned Entities

) and the Toys segment no longer meets the criteria
to be a separate reportable segment.  Accordingly, effective January 1, 2015, the
Retail Properties segment and Toys have been reclassified to the Other segment.

Segment Information – continued

Notes to preceding tabular
  information:

(1)

EBITDA
  represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and
  Amortization."  We consider EBITDA a non-GAAP financial measure for
  making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as
  it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on
  equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we
  utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the
  performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be
  considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to
  similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)

Interest
  and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax expense in the
  reconciliation of net income to EBITDA includes our share of these items from
  partially owned entities.

(c)

The year ended December 31, 2015 includes $6,217 from the
  acceleration of the recognition of compensation expense related to 2013-2015
  Out-Performance Plans due to the modification of the vesting criteria of
  awards such that they will fully vest at age 65. The accelerated expense will
  result in lower general and administrative expense for 2016 of $2,940 and
  $3,277 thereafter.


VORNADO REALTY TRUST

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

25.  Subsequent Events

2016 Out-Performance Plan

On January 14, 2016, the Compensation
Committee approved the 2016 Outperformance Plan, a multi-year,
performance-based equity compensation plan and related form of award agreement
(the “2016 OPP”).  Awards under the 2016 OPP constitute awards under Vornado’s
shareholder approved 2010 Omnibus Share Plan.  Under the 2016 OPP,
participants, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, have the
opportunity to earn compensation payable in the form of operating partnership
units if, and only if, we outperform a predetermined total shareholder return
(“TSR”) and/or outperform the market with respect to relative total TSR during
a three-year performance period.  Specifically, awards under our 2016 OPP may
potentially be earned if we (i) achieve a TSR above that of the SNL US REIT
Index (the “Index”) over a three-year performance period (the “Relative
Component”) and/or (ii) achieve a TSR level greater than 7% per annum, or 21%
over the three-year performance period (the “Absolute Component”).  To the
extent awards would be earned under the Absolute Component but we underperform
the Index, such awards earned under the Absolute Component would be reduced
(and potentially fully negated) based on the degree to which we underperform
the Index.  In certain circumstances, in the event we outperform the Index but
awards would not otherwise be earned under the Absolute Component, awards may
still be earned under the Relative Component.  Moreover, to the extent awards
would otherwise be earned under the Relative Component but we fail to achieve
at least a 3% per annum absolute TSR, such awards earned under the Relative
Component would be reduced based on our absolute TSR performance, with no
awards being earned in the event our TSR during the applicable measurement period
is 0% or negative, irrespective of the degree to which it may outperform the
Index.  If the designated performance objectives are achieved, OPP Units are
also subject to time-based vesting requirements.  Dividend payments on awards
issued accrue during the performance period and are paid to participants if,
and only if, awards are ultimately earned based on the achievement of the
designated performance objectives.  In addition, all of our executive officers
(for the purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act) are required to hold any
earned OPP Units for one year following vesting.

770 Broadway Refinancing

On February 8, 2016, we completed a
$700,000,000 refinancing of 770 Broadway, a 1,158,000 square foot Manhattan
office building.  The five-year loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.75%
(2.18% at February 11, 2016) which was swapped for four and a half years to a
fixed rate of 2.56%.  We realized net proceeds of approximately $330,000,000. 
The property was previously encumbered by a 5.65%, $353,000,000 mortgage
maturing in March 2016.


ITEM
9.        changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and
financial disclosure

None.

ITEM 9A.     Controls
and procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures:  Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a‑15 (e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period
covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the
end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: 
There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended) during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to which
this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Management of Vornado Realty Trust, together
with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”), is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial
officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external
reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

As of December 31, 2015, management conducted an
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework established in

Internal Control –
Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management
has determined that our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2015 was effective.

Our internal control over financial reporting
includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and
dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and our trustees; and provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial
statements.

The effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report appearing on page 140, which expresses an unqualified opinion on
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2015.


REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders
and Board of Trustees

Vornado
Realty Trust

New York, New
York

We have
audited the internal control over financial reporting of Vornado Realty Trust,
together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2015, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework
(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted
our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under
the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the
company’s board of trustees, management, and other personnel to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of
the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 of
the Company and our report dated February 16, 2016 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules and
included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s adoption of a new
accounting standard.
