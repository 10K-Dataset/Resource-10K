PART I

BUSINESS

THE COMPANY

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully-integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 90.6% of the common limited partnership interest in, the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2008. All references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership.

As of December 31, 2008, we own directly or indirectly:

:

(i)      all or portions of 28 office properties aggregating approximately 16.1 million square feet in the New York City metropolitan area (primarily Manhattan);

(ii)      all or portions of 84 office properties aggregating 17.7 million square feet in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia areas;

(x)      interests in other real estate, including interests in office, industrial and retail properties net leased to major corporations; 6 warehouse/industrial properties in New Jersey containing approximately 1.2 million square feet; and other investments and marketable securities.


OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through:

•

Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

•

Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;

•

Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

•

Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;

•

Investing in fully-integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate component; and

•

Developing and redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

In the second half of 2007 the residential mortgage and capital markets began showing signs of stress, primarily in the form of escalating default rates on sub-prime mortgages, declining home values and increasing inventory nationwide.  In 2008, the “credit crisis” spread to the broader commercial credit and financial markets resulting in illiquidity and volatility in the bond and equity markets.  We are currently in an economic recession which has negatively affected all businesses, including ours.  During the past year, real estate transactions have diminished significantly and capitalization rates have risen.  Our real estate portfolio may be affected by declining demand for office and retail space and tenant bankruptcies, which may result in lower average occupancy rates and effective rents, and a corresponding decrease in net income, funds from operations and cash flow.
In addition, the value of our assets, including investments in joint ventures, marketable securities, and mezzanine loans may also decline, and may result in impairment charges and/or valuation allowances and a corresponding decrease in net income and funds from operations.

ACQUISTIONS

There were no material real estate acquisitions or investments in partially owned entities and mezzanine loans during 2008.


DISPOSITIONS

On March 31, 2008, we sold our 47.6% interest in Americold, our Temperature Controlled Logistics segment, for $220,000,000, in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $112,690,000.

On June 6, 2008, we sold our Tysons Dulles Plaza office building complex located in Tysons Corner, Virginia for approximately $152,800,000, in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $56,831,000.

Pursuant to the sale of GMH Communities L.P. (“GMH”) military housing division and the merger of its student housing division with American Campus Communities, Inc (“ACC”) (NYSE: ACC), in June 2008 we received an aggregate of $105,180,000, consisting of $82,142,000 in cash and 753,126 shares of ACC common stock valued at $23,038,000 based on ACC’s then closing share price of $30.59, in exchange for our entire interest in GMH.  We subsequently sold all of the ACC common shares.  The above transactions resulted in a net gain of $2,038,000.  The aggregate net income realized from inception of this investment in 2004 through its disposition was $77,000,000.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

During 2008 we completed approximately $1.3 billion of property level financings and repaid approximately $241,000,000 of existing debt with a portion of the proceeds.  In addition, we purchased $81,540,000 (aggregate face amount) of our 4.50% senior unsecured notes due August 15, 2009, for $80,408,000 in cash, resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $783,000.  We also purchased $10,200,000 and $17,300,000 (aggregate face amounts) of our 3.63% and 2.85% convertible senior debentures, respectively, for an aggregate of $18,080,000 in cash, resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $9,037,000.

The net proceeds we received from dispositions and financings above were used primarily for general corporate purposes.  We may seek to obtain additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings or asset sales, although there is no express policy with respect to these capital markets transactions. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities in the future.


DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

We are currently engaged in various development/redevelopment projects for which we have budgeted approximately $1.2 billion. Of this amount, $393.4 million was expended prior to 2008 and $411.5 million was expended during 2008.  Substantially all of the estimated costs to complete our development projects are anticipated to be expended during 2009, of which $266.1 million is expected to be funded by existing construction loans.

SEASONALITY

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarter-by-quarter net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations. The business of Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”) is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys’ fourth quarter net income, which we record on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. The Merchandise Mart segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage rental income.

TENANTS ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 10% OF REVENUES

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

CERTAIN ACTIVITIES

We are not required to base our acquisitions and investments on specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for long-term investment; however, it is possible that properties in the portfolio may be sold as circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property. While we may seek the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by our Board of Trustees without the vote of shareholders.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2008, we have approximately 3,529 employees, of which 340 are corporate staff. The New York Office Properties segment has 106 employees and an additional 2,054 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering services to New York Office properties. The Washington, DC Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart segments have 222, 190 and 585 employees, respectively, and the Hotel Pennsylvania has 523 employees. The foregoing does not include employees of partially owned entities, including Toys or Alexander’s, in which we own 32.7% and 32.5%, respectively.

SEGMENT DATA

We operate in the following business segments: New York Office Properties, Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties, Merchandise Mart Properties and Toys. Financial information related to these business segments for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are set forth in Note 20 – Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The Merchandise Mart Properties segment has trade show operations in Canada and Switzerland. The Toys segment has 714 locations internationally. In addition, we have five partially owned nonconsolidated investments in real estate partnerships located in India, which are included in the Other segment.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Material factors that may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition are summarized below.

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS' VALUE AND INCOME FLUCTUATE DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS.

The value of real estate fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business. These conditions may also limit our revenues and available cash.

The factors that affect the value of our real estate investments include, among other things:

•

national, regional and local economic conditions;

•

competition from other available space;

•

local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area;

•

how well we manage our properties;

•

changes in market rental rates;

•

the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;

•

whether we are able to pass some or all of any increased operating costs through to tenants;

•

changes in real estate taxes and other expenses;

•

whether tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property attractive;

•

the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;

•

availability of financing on acceptable terms or at all;

•

fluctuations in interest rates;

•

our ability to secure adequate insurance;

•

changes in taxation or zoning laws;

•

government regulation;

•

consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the United States;

•

potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations; and

•

general competitive factors.

The rents we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors. If rental revenues and/or occupancy levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available to pay indebtedness and for distribution to shareholders. In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, generally do not decline when the related rents decline.

Capital markets and economic conditions can materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the value of our debt and equity securities.

There are many factors that can affect the value of our debt and equity securities, including the state of the capital markets and economy.  In the second half of 2007 the residential mortgage and capital markets began showing signs of stress, primarily in the form of escalating default rates on sub-prime mortgages, declining home values and increasing inventory nationwide.  In 2008, the “credit crisis” spread to the broader commercial credit and financial markets resulting in illiquidity and volatility in the bond and equity markets.  We are currently in an economic recession which has negatively affected all businesses including ours.  These conditions have contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels.  As a result, the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads.
Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide funding to borrowers, and may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants.  If these market conditions continue, they may limit our ability and the ability of our tenants, to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs, resulting in materially adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations and the value of our debt and equity securities.


Real estate is a competitive business.

Our business segments – Office, Retail, Merchandise Mart, Toys and Other – operate in highly competitive environments. We have a large concentration of properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia areas. We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.

We depend on leasing space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from tenants who may not be able to pay.

Our
    financial results depend significantly on leasing space in
    our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms.
    In addition, because a substantial majority of our income
    comes from renting of real property, our income, funds available
    to pay indebtedness and funds available for distribution
    to shareholders will decrease if a significant number of
    our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to
    maintain occupancy levels on favorable terms. If a tenant
    does not pay its rent, we may not be able to enforce our
    rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial
    legal costs. During periods of economic adversity such as
    we are currently experiencing, there may be an
    increase in the number of tenants that cannot pay their rent
    and an increase in vacancy rates.

Bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenues and available cash.

From time to time, some of our tenants have declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the future. In the case of our shopping centers, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could cause us to suffer lower revenues and operational difficulties, including leasing the remainder of the property. As a result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could result in a lower level of net income and funds available for the payment of indebtedness or for distribution to shareholders.  Circuit City, which leases 12 locations in our Retail Properties segment aggregating 380,000 square feet, approximately $8,100,000 of annual property rental income, recently announced that it is liquidating, pursuant to Bankruptcy Court approval.  As a result, we wrote-off approximately $10,383,000 of unamortized costs at December 31, 2008, including tenant
improvements, leasing commissions and receivables arising from the straight-lining of rent.  The current economic environment may result in additional tenant bankruptcies and write-offs, which could, in the aggregate, be material to our results of operations in a particular period.

We may incur costs to comply with environmental laws.

Our operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may impair our ability to sell or lease
real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and underground storage tanks are also regulated by federal and state laws. We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or tanks or
related claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure to contamination at or from our properties.

Each of our properties has been subject to varying degrees of environmental assessment. The environmental assessments did not, as of this date, reveal any environmental condition material to our business. However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, discovery of additional sites, human exposure to the contamination or changes in cleanup or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us.


Inflation or deflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Although neither inflation nor deflation has materially impacted our operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a pronounced negative impact on our mortgages and interest rates and general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents.  Inflation could also have an adverse effect on consumer spending which could impact our tenants’ sales and, in turn, our percentage rents, where applicable.  Conversely, deflation could lead to downward pressure on rents and other sources of income.

Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.

We carry commercial liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) “acts of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (“TRIPRA”) , which expires in December 2014, and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to our assets.  Our New York Office, Washington, DC Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart divisions have $2.0 billion of per occurrence all risk property insurance coverage, including terrorism coverage in effect through September 15, 2009.  Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $150,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, and a $150,000,000 annual aggregate.

In June 2007 we formed Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, to act as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage and as a direct insurer for coverage for “certified” acts of terrorism and for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by TRIPRA.  Coverage for “certified” acts of terrorism is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC.  Prior to the formation of PPIC, we were uninsured for NBCR losses.  Subsequently, we have $2.0 billion of NBCR coverage under TRIPRA, for which PPIC is responsible for 15% of each NBCR loss and the insurance company deductible of $1,000,000.   We are ultimately responsible for any loss borne by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties (which are generally non-recourse to us), senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance and/or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Because we operate one hotel property, we face the risks associated with the hospitality industry.

We own the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City. If the hotel does not generate sufficient receipts, our cash flow would decrease, which could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders. The following factors, among others, are common to the hotel industry, and may reduce the revenues generated by our hotel property:

•

our hotel competes for guests with other hotels, a number of which have greater marketing and financial resources;

•

if there is an increase in operating costs resulting from inflation and other factors, we may not be able to offset such increase by increasing room rates;

•

our hotel is subject to the fluctuating and seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism;

•

our hotel is subject to general and local economic and social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, including war and terrorism; and

•

physical condition, which may require substantial additional capital.

Because of the ownership structure of our hotel, we face potential adverse effects from changes to the applicable tax laws.

Under the Internal Revenue Code, REITs like us are not allowed to operate hotels directly or indirectly. Accordingly, we lease The Hotel Pennsylvania to our taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS. While the TRS structure allows the economic benefits of ownership to flow to us, the TRS is subject to tax on its income from the operations of the hotel at the federal and state level. In addition, the TRS is subject to detailed tax regulations that affect how it may be capitalized and operated. If the tax laws applicable to a TRS are modified, we may be forced to modify the structure for owning the hotel, and such changes may adversely affect the cash flows from the hotel. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, and we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws,
regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any of such actions may prospectively or retroactively modify the tax treatment of the TRS and, therefore, may adversely affect our after-tax returns from the hotel.


Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.

The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. From time to time persons have asserted claims against us with respect to some of our properties under this Act, but to date such claims have not resulted in any material expense or liability. If, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders.

Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.

OUR INVESTMENTS ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE NEW YORK CITY METROPOLITAN AREA AND WASHINGTON, DC / NORTHERN VIRGINIA AREAS. CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING THESE AREAS GENERALLY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

A significant portion of our properties are in the New York City / New Jersey metropolitan areas and Washington, DC / Northern Virginia areas are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent to those areas.

During
    2008, approximately 71% of our EBITDA, excluding items that
    affect comparability, came from properties located in the
    New York City / New Jersey metropolitan areas and the Washington,
    DC / Northern Virginia areas. We may continue to concentrate
    a significant portion of our future acquisitions in these
    areas or in other geographic real estate markets in the United
    States or abroad. Real estate markets are subject to economic
    downturns, as they have been in the past, and we cannot predict
    how economic conditions will impact these markets in both
    the short and long term. Declines in the economy or a decline
    in the real estate markets in these areas could hurt our
    financial performance and the value of our properties. The
factors affecting economic conditions in these regions include:

•

financial performance and productivity of the publishing, advertising, financial, technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries;

•

space needs of the United States Government, including the effect of base closures and repositioning under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 2005, as amended;

•

business layoffs or downsizing;

•

industry slowdowns;

•

relocations of businesses;

•

changing demographics;

•

increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places;

•

infrastructure quality; and

•

any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.

It is impossible for us to assess with certainty the future effects of the current adverse trends in the economic and investment climates of the geographic areas in which we concentrate, and more generally of the United States, or the real estate markets in these areas. If these conditions persist or if there is any further local, national or global economic downturn, our businesses and future profitability will be adversely affected.

Terrorist attacks, such as those of September

11, 2001 in New York City and the Washington, DC area, may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.

We have significant investments in large metropolitan areas, including the New York, Washington, DC, Chicago, Boston and San Francisco metropolitan areas. In the aftermath of a terrorist attack, tenants in these areas may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in these areas. This in turn would trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these areas, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease space on less favorable terms. As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues and cash flows could decline materially.


WE MAY

ACQUIRE OR SELL ADDITIONAL ASSETS OR ENTITIES OR DEVELOP ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES. OUR FAILURE OR INABILITY TO CONSUMMATE THESE TRANSACTIONS OR MANAGE THE RESULTS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

We have grown rapidly through acquisitions. We may not be able to maintain this rapid growth and our failure to do so could adversely affect our stock price.

We have experienced rapid growth in recent years, increasing our total assets from approximately $565 million at December 31, 1997 to approximately $21.4 billion at December 31, 2008. We may not be able to maintain a similar rate of growth in the future or manage growth effectively. Our failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and ability to pay dividends to shareholders.

We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks.

We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies. We may not, however, succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. In addition, we may face competition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. When we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover our costs of acquisition and development or in operating the businesses we acquired.  Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management’s attention. Acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in
poorer than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated. Furthermore, acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware at the time of acquisition. In addition, development of our existing properties presents similar risks.

From time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, one or more material acquisitions.  The announcement of such a material acquisition may result in a rapid and significant decline in the price of our common shares.

We are continuously looking at material transactions that we will believe will maximize shareholder value.  However, an announcement by us of one or more significant acquisitions could result in a quick and significant decline in the price of our common shares and convertible and exchangeable securities.

It may be difficult to buy and sell real estate quickly.

Real estate investments are relatively difficult to buy and sell quickly. Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.

We may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the debt associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs.

As part of an acquisition of a property, including our January 1, 2002 acquisition of Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P.’s 13.0 million square foot portfolio, we may agree, and in the case of Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P. did agree, with the seller that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on them for a period of 12 years, unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the seller. These agreements could result in us holding on to properties that we would otherwise sell and not pay down or refinance indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance.

On January

1, 2002, we completed the acquisition of the 66% interest in Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P. that we did not previously own. The terms of the merger restrict our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of, or to finance or refinance, the properties formerly owned by Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P., which could result in our inability to sell these properties at an opportune time and increased costs to us.

As indicated above, subject to limited exceptions, we are restricted from selling or otherwise transferring or disposing of certain properties located in the Crystal City area of Arlington, Virginia for a period of 12 years. These restrictions, which currently cover approximately 13.0 million square feet of space, could result in our inability to sell these properties at an opportune time and increase costs to us.


From time to time we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control. Some of these companies operate in industries that differ from our current operations, with different risks than investing in real estate.

From time to time we make debt or equity investments in other companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control. These investments include but are not limited to,  Alexander’s, Inc., Toys “R” Us, Lexington Realty Trust, and equity and mezzanine investments in other entities that have significant real estate assets. Although these businesses generally have a significant real estate component, some of them operate in businesses that are different from our primary lines of business including, without limitation, operating or managing toy stores and department stores. Consequently, investments in these businesses, among other risks, subjects us to the operating and financial risks of industries other than real estate and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses. From time to time we may make
additional investments in or acquire other entities that may subject us to additional similar risks. Investments in entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures, present additional risks such as having differing objectives than our partners or the entities in which we invest, or becoming involved in disputes, or competing with those persons. In addition, we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to comply with applicable standards may adversely affect us.

We are subject to risks that affect the general retail environment.

A substantial portion of our properties are in the retail shopping center real estate market and we have a significant investment in retailers such as Toys “R” Us. See “

Our investment in Toys “R” Us, Inc. subjects us to risks different from our other lines of business and may result in increased seasonality and volatility in our reported earnings

” below. This means that we are subject to factors that affect the retail environment generally, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, the threat of terrorism and increasing competition from discount retailers, outlet malls, retail websites and catalog companies. These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants and the retailers in which we hold an investment and the willingness of retailers to lease space in
our shopping centers, and in turn, adversely affect us.

We depend upon our anchor tenants to attract shoppers.

We own several regional malls and other shopping centers that are typically anchored by well-known department stores and other tenants who generate shopping traffic at the mall or shopping center. The value of our properties would be adversely affected if tenants or anchors failed to meet their contractual obligations, sought concessions in order to continue operations or ceased their operations. If the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to economic conditions, closing of anchors or for other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the event of a default by a tenant or anchor, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord.

Our investment in Toys “R” Us, Inc. subjects us to risks different from our other lines of business and may result in increased seasonality and volatility in our reported earnings.

On July 21, 2005, a joint venture that we own equally with Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. acquired Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”). Because Toys is a retailer, its operations subject us to the risks of a retail company that are different than those presented by our other lines of business. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. In addition, our fiscal year ends on December 31 whereas, as is common for retailers, Toys’ fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. Therefore, we record our pro-rata share of Toys’ net earnings on a one-quarter lag basis. For example, our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2008 include Toys’ financial results for its first, second and third quarters ended
November 1, 2008, as well as Toys’ fourth quarter results of 2007. Because of the seasonality of Toys, our reported net income shows increased volatility. We may also, in the future and from time to time, invest in other businesses that may report financial results that are more volatile than our historical financial results.


We invest in subordinated or mezzanine debt of certain entities that have significant real estate assets.  These investments involve greater risk of loss than investments in senior mortgage loans.

We invest, and may in the future invest, in subordinated or mezzanine debt of certain entities that have significant real estate assets.  As of December 31, 2008, our mezzanine debt securities have an aggregate carrying amount of $472,539,000.  These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate.  These investments involve greater risk of loss than investments in senior mortgage loans which are secured by real property.  If a borrower defaults on debt to us or on debt senior to us, or declares bankruptcy, we may not be able to recover some or all of our investment.  The value of the assets securing or supporting our investments could deteriorate over time due to factors beyond our control, including acts or omissions by owners, changes in
business, economic or market conditions, or foreclosure.  Such deteriorations in value may result in the recognition of impairment losses on our statement of operations.  In addition, there may be significant delays and costs associated with the process of foreclosing on collateral securing or supporting these investments.

We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans, if circumstances warrant, in determining whether they are impaired. A loan is impaired when based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan’s effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if repayment of the loan is collateral dependent.  There can be no assurance that our estimates of collectible amounts will not change over time or that they will be representative of the amounts we actually collect, including amounts we would collect if we chose to sell these
investments before their maturity.  If we collect less than our estimates, we will record impairment losses which could be material.

We invest in marketable equity securities of companies that have significant real estate assets.  The value of these investments may decline as a result of operating performance or economic or market conditions.

We invest, and may in the future invest, in marketable equity securities of publicly-traded real estate companies or companies that have significant real estate assets.  During 2008, we recognized $76,352,000 of impairment losses on our investments in marketable securities, based on the severity and duration of the declines in the market value of these securities.  As of December 31, 2008, our marketable securities have an aggregate carrying amount of $334,322,000.  Significant declines in the value of these investments due to operating performance or economic or market conditions may result in the recognition of additional impairment losses which could be material.

OUR ORGANIZATIONAL AND FINANCIAL STRUCTURE GIVES RISE TO OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS.

We May

Not Be Able to Obtain Capital to Make Investments.

We depend primarily on external financing to fund the growth of our business. This is because one of the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for a REIT is that it distributes 90% of its net taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its shareholders. There is a separate requirement to distribute net capital gains or pay a corporate level tax in lieu thereof. Our access to debt or equity financing depends on the willingness of third parties to lend or make equity investments and on conditions in the capital markets generally. As a result of the current capital markets and environmental conditions referred to above, we and other companies in the real estate industry are currently experiencing limited availability of financing and there can be no assurances as to when more financing will be available.  Although we believe that we will be able to finance any
investments we may wish to make in the foreseeable future, new financing may not be available on acceptable terms.

For information about our available sources of funds, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


Vornado Realty Trust depends on dividends and distributions from its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The creditors and preferred security holders of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to Vornado Realty Trust.

Substantially all of Vornado Realty Trust’s assets are held through its Operating Partnership that holds substantially all of its properties and assets through subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership’s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by its subsidiaries, and in turn, substantially all of Vornado Realty Trust’s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by the Operating Partnership. The creditors of each of Vornado Realty Trust’s direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations to them, when due and payable, before distributions may be made by that subsidiary to its equity holders. Thus, the Operating Partnership’s ability to make distributions to holders of its units depends on its subsidiaries’ ability first to satisfy their obligations to their creditors and then to make distributions
to the Operating Partnership. Likewise, Vornado Realty Trust’s ability to pay dividends to holders of common and preferred shares depends on the Operating Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions payable to holders of preferred units and then to make distributions to Vornado Realty Trust.

Furthermore, the holders of preferred units of the Operating Partnership are entitled to receive preferred distributions before payment of distributions to holders of common units of the Operating Partnership, including Vornado Realty Trust. Thus, Vornado Realty Trust’s ability to pay cash dividends to holders of its shares and satisfy its debt obligations depends on the Operating Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions payable to holders of preferred units and then to make distributions to Vornado Realty Trust. As of December 31, 2008, there were eight series of preferred units of the Operating Partnership not held by Vornado Realty Trust that have preference over Vornado Realty Trust common shares with a total liquidation value of $372,094,000.

In addition, Vornado Realty Trust’s participation in any distribution of the assets of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency, is only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors and preferred security holders, are satisfied.

We have indebtedness, and this indebtedness, and its cost, may increase and debt refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.

As
    of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $15.846 billion
    of total debt outstanding, including our pro rata share of
    debt of partially owned entities. Our ratio of total debt
    to total enterprise value was approximately 59%. When we
    say “enterprise value” in the preceding sentence, we mean market equity value of Vornado Realty Trust’s common and preferred shares plus total debt outstanding, including our pro rata share of debt of partially owned entities. In the future, we may incur additional debt to finance acquisitions or property developments and thus increase our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value. If our level of indebtedness increases, there may be an increased risk of a credit rating downgrade or a default on our obligations that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in a rising interest rate
environment, the cost of existing variable rate debt and any new debt or other market rate security or instrument may increase.  Furthermore, in the current “credit crisis” environment, we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms.

Covenants in our debt instruments could adversely affect our financial condition and our acquisitions and development activities.

The mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage. Our unsecured credit facilities, unsecured debt securities and other loans that we may obtain in the future contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including covenants that limit our ability to incur debt based upon the level of our ratio of total debt to total assets, our ratio of secured debt to total assets, our ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, and fixed charges, and that require us to maintain a certain level of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt. Our ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to compliance with certain financial and other covenants. In addition, failure to comply with
our covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt instrument, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or be available only on unattractive terms. Additionally, our ability to satisfy current or prospective lenders’ insurance requirements may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon greater insurance coverage against acts of terrorism than is available to us in the marketplace or on commercially reasonable terms.

We rely on debt financing, including borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities, issuances of unsecured debt securities and debt secured by individual properties, to finance acquisitions and development activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt financing from these or other sources, or refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected. If we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders can declare a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of the property securing the defaulted loan.


Vornado Realty Trust may fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT and may be required to pay income taxes at corporate rates.

Although we believe that we will remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may fail to remain qualified in this way. Qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. Our qualification as a REIT also depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to the requirements for qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT.

If, with respect to any taxable year, we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions, we could not deduct distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The federal income tax payable would include any applicable alternative minimum tax. If we had to pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute to shareholders and pay our indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved, and we would no longer be required to make distributions to shareholders. In addition, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost, unless we were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions. Although we currently intend to
operate in a manner designed to allow us to qualify as a REIT, future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause us to revoke the REIT election or fail to qualify as a REIT.

We face possible adverse changes in tax laws, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.

From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. The shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for payment of dividends.

Loss of our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common shares.

We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado Realty Trust, and Michael D. Fascitelli, the President of Vornado Realty Trust. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common shares.

VORNADO REALTY TRUST'S CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND APPLICABLE LAW MAY HINDER ANY ATTEMPT TO ACQUIRE US.

Our Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust sets limits on the ownership of our shares.

Generally, for Vornado Realty Trust to maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% in value of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of Vornado Realty Trust may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of Vornado Realty Trust’s taxable year. The Internal Revenue Code defines “individuals” for purposes of the requirement described in the preceding sentence to include some types of entities. Under Vornado Realty Trust’s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as amended, no person may own more than 6.7% of the outstanding common shares of any class, or 9.9% of the outstanding preferred shares of any class, with some exceptions for persons who held common shares in excess of the 6.7% limit before Vornado Realty Trust adopted the limit and other persons approved
by Vornado Realty Trust’s Board of Trustees. These restrictions on transferability and ownership may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado Realty Trust or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the shareholders. We refer to Vornado Realty Trust’s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as amended, as the “declaration of trust.”

We have a classified Board of Trustees and that may reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Vornado Realty Trust’s Board of Trustees is divided into three classes of trustees. Trustees of each class are chosen for three-year staggered terms. Staggered terms of trustees may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of Vornado Realty Trust, even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of Vornado Realty Trust’s shareholders.


We may issue additional shares in a manner that could adversely affect the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Vornado Realty Trust’s declaration of trust authorizes the Board of Trustees to:

•

cause Vornado Realty Trust to issue additional authorized but unissued common shares or preferred shares;

•

classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred shares;

•

set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified shares that Vornado Realty Trust issues; and

•

increase, without shareholder approval, the number of shares of beneficial interest that Vornado Realty Trust may issue.

The Board of Trustees could establish a series of preferred shares whose terms could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado Realty Trust or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of Vornado Realty Trust’s shareholders, although the Board of Trustees does not now intend to establish a series of preferred shares of this kind. Vornado Realty Trust’s declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado Realty Trust or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders.

The Maryland General Corporation Law contains provisions that may reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, as amended, which we refer to as the “MGCL,” as applicable to REITs, certain “business combinations,” including certain mergers, consolidations, share exchanges and asset transfers and certain issuances and reclassifications of equity securities, between a Maryland REIT and any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the trust’s shares or an affiliate or an associate, as defined in the MGCL, of the trust who, at any time within the two-year period before the date in question, was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting shares of beneficial interest of the trust, which we refer to as an “interested shareholder,” or an affiliate of the interested shareholder, are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which
the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder. After that five-year period, any business combination of these kinds must be recommended by the board of trustees of the trust and approved by the affirmative vote of at least (a) 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of beneficial interest of the trust and (b) two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting shares of the trust other than shares held by the interested shareholder with whom, or with whose affiliate, the business combination is to be effected, unless, among other conditions, the trust’s common shareholders receive a minimum price, as defined in the MGCL, for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares.

The provisions of the MGCL do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of trustees of the applicable trust before the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, and a person is not an interested shareholder if the board of trustees approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested shareholder.

In approving a transaction, the Board may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the Board.  Vornado Realty Trust’s Board has adopted a resolution exempting any business combination between any trustee or officer of Vornado Realty Trust, or their affiliates, and Vornado Realty Trust. As a result, the trustees and officers of Vornado Realty Trust and their affiliates may be able to enter into business combinations with Vornado Realty Trust that may not be in the best interest of shareholders. With respect to business combinations with other persons, the business combination provisions of the MGCL may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Vornado Realty Trust or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the
shareholders. The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of Vornado Realty Trust and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.

We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our shareholders.

Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other companies, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Trustees. Accordingly, our shareholders do not control these policies.


OUR OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE AND RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS MAY

GIVE RISE TO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

Steven Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of our other trustees and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.

As of December 31, 2008, Interstate Properties, a New Jersey general partnership, and its partners owned approximately 8.8% of the common shares of Vornado Realty Trust and approximately 27.0% of the common stock of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the three partners of Interstate Properties. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado Realty Trust, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties and the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s. Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are trustees of Vornado Realty Trust and also directors of Alexander’s.

As of December 31, 2008, the Operating Partnership owned 32.5% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s. Alexander’s is a REIT engaged in leasing, managing, developing and redeveloping properties, focusing primarily on the locations where its department stores operated before they ceased operations in 1992. Alexander’s has seven properties, which are located in the greater New York metropolitan area. Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli, the President and a trustee of Vornado Realty Trust, are directors of Alexander’s. Messrs. Mandelbaum, West and Wight are trustees of Vornado Realty Trust and are directors of Alexander’s.

Because of these overlapping interests, Mr. Roth and Interstate Properties and its partners may have substantial influence over Vornado Realty Trust and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Vornado Realty Trust shareholders for approval. In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate Properties and our other equity or debt holders. In addition, Mr. Roth, Interstate Properties and its partners, and Alexander’s currently and may in the future engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as which of these entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of
properties and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these entities.

Vornado Realty Trust currently manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate Properties under a management agreement for which it receives an annual fee equal to 4% of base rent and percentage rent and certain other commissions. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term. Vornado Realty Trust earned $803,000, $800,000, and $798,000 of management fees under the management agreement for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Because of the relationship among Vornado Realty Trust, Interstate Properties and Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight, as described above, the terms of the management agreement and any future agreements between Vornado Realty Trust and Interstate Properties may not be comparable to those Vornado Realty Trust could have
negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.

There may be conflicts of interest between Alexander’s and us.

As of December 31, 2008, the Operating Partnership owned 32.5% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s. Alexander’s is a REIT engaged in leasing, managing, developing and redeveloping properties, focusing primarily on the locations where its department stores operated before they ceased operations in 1992. Alexander’s has seven properties. Interstate Properties, which is described above, and its partners owned an additional 27.0% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s as of December 31, 2008. Mr. Roth, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado Realty Trust, is Chief Executive Officer, a director of Alexander’s and managing general partner of Interstate, and Mr. Fascitelli, President and a trustee of Vornado Realty Trust, is President and a director of Alexander’s. Messrs. Mandelbaum, West and Wight, trustees
of us, are also directors of Alexander’s and general partners of Interstate.  In addition, Joseph Macnow, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, holds the same position with Alexander’s.  Alexander’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “ALX.”

The Operating Partnership manages, develops and leases the Alexander’s properties under management and development agreements and leasing agreements under which the Operating Partnership receives annual fees from Alexander’s. These agreements have a one-year term expiring in March of each year and are all automatically renewable. Because Vornado Realty Trust and Alexander’s share common senior management and because a majority of the trustees of Vornado Realty Trust also constitute a majority of the directors of Alexander’s, the terms of the foregoing agreements and any future agreements between us and Alexander’s may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.


For a description of Interstate Properties’ ownership of Vornado Realty Trust and Alexander’s, see “Steven Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of our other trustees and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us” above.

THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF VORNADO REALTY TRUST AND THE MARKET FOR THOSE SHARES GIVE RISE TO VARIOUS RISKS.

The trading price of our common shares has recently been volatile and may fluctuate.

The trading price of our common shares has recently been volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control.  In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies.  These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common shares.  Among the factors that could affect the price of our common shares are:

•

actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;

•

the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and fixed income securities;

•

the effect of the “credit crisis” on the broader commercial credit and financial markets and the resulting illiquidity and volatility in the equity and bond markets;

•

changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other real estate investment trusts;

•

failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;

•

speculation in the press or investment community;

•

strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;

•

the extent of institutional interest in us;

•

the extent of short-selling of our common shares and the shares of our competitors;

•

fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;

•

general financial and economic market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for real estate investment trusts and other real estate related companies; and

•

domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance.

A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for shareholders.

Vornado Realty Trust has many shares available for future sale, which could hurt the market price of its shares.

As of December 31, 2008, we had authorized but unissued, 94,714,097 common shares of beneficial interest, $.04 par value, and 76,045,876 preferred shares of beneficial interest, no par value, of which 68,045,876 preferred shares have not been reserved and remain available for issuance as a newly-designated class of preferred. We may issue these authorized but unissued shares from time to time in public or private offerings or in connection with acquisitions.

In addition, as of December 31, 2008, 13,543,949 common shares were reserved for issuance upon redemption of Operating Partnership common units. Some of these shares may be sold in the public market after registration under the Securities Act under registration rights agreements between Vornado Realty Trust and some holders of common units of the Operating Partnership. These shares may also be sold in the public market under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or other available exemptions from registration. In addition, we have reserved a number of common shares for issuance under employee benefit plans, and these common shares will be available for sale from time to time. We have awarded shares of restricted stock and granted options to purchase additional common shares to some of our executive officers and employees. Of the authorized but unissued common and preferred shares above,
47,085,164 common and 8,000,000 preferred shares, in the aggregate, were reserved for issuance upon the redemption of Operating Partnership units, conversion of outstanding convertible securities, under benefit plans or for other activity not directly under our control.

We cannot predict the effect that future sales of Vornado Realty Trust common and preferred shares or Operating Partnership common and preferred units will have on the market prices of Vornado Realty Trust’s outstanding shares.


Increased market interest rates may hurt the value of Vornado Realty Trust’s common and preferred shares.

We believe that investors consider the distribution rate on REIT shares, expressed as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates as an important factor in deciding whether to buy or sell the shares. If market interest rates go up, prospective purchasers of REIT shares may expect a higher distribution rate. Higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and might decrease funds available for distribution. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of Vornado Realty Trust’s common and preferred shares to decline.

New York Office Properties lease terms generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenant spaces to as long as 15 years for major tenants, and may provide for extension options at market rates. Leases typically provide for periodic step-ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants, the tenant’s share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year. Electricity is provided to tenants on a sub-metered basis or included in rent based on surveys and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases. Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.

RETAIL PROPERTIES

As of December 31, 2008, we own 176 retail properties, of which 146 are strip shopping centers located primarily in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and California; 7 are regional malls located in New York, New Jersey, Virginia and San Juan, Puerto Rico; and 23 are retail properties located in Manhattan (“Manhattan Street Retail”).  Our strip shopping centers and malls are generally located on major highways in mature, densely populated areas, and therefore attract consumers from a regional, rather than a neighborhood market place.

Strip Shopping Centers

Our strip shopping centers contain an aggregate of 12.4 million square feet and are substantially (over 80%) leased to large stores (over 20,000 square feet). Tenants include destination retailers such as discount department stores, supermarkets, home improvement stores, discount apparel stores and membership warehouse clubs. Tenants typically offer basic consumer necessities such as food, health and beauty aids, moderately priced clothing, building materials and home improvement supplies, and compete primarily on the basis of price and location.

Regional Malls

The Green Acres Mall in Valley Stream, Long Island, New York contains 1.8 million square feet, and is anchored by Macy*s, Sears, Wal-Mart, J.C. Penney, Best Buy and a BJ’s Wholesale Club.

The Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, New Jersey, in which we own a 50% interest, contains 1.5 million square feet and is anchored by Macy*s, Lord & Taylor and J.C. Penney, two of which own their stores aggregating 457,000 square feet.

The Springfield Mall in Springfield, Virginia contains 1.4 million square feet and is anchored by Macy*s, J.C. Penney and Target who own their stores aggregating 390,000 square feet.

The Bergen Town Center in Paramus, New Jersey, upon completion of its redevelopment in 2009, will contain 950,000 square feet of retail space.  The mall is anchored by Century 21, Whole Foods and Target under leases aggregating 416,000 square feet.  In addition to the mall, we are developing 250,000 square feet of retail space on 27.5 acres of adjacent land which is expected to be completed in 2010.

The Broadway Mall in Hicksville, Long Island, New York contains 1.1 million square feet and is anchored by Macy*s, Ikea, Multiplex Cinema and Target, which owns its store containing 141,000 square feet.

The Montehiedra Mall in San Juan, Puerto Rico contains 541,000 square feet and is anchored by Home Depot, Kmart, and Marshalls.

The Las Catalinas Mall in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contains 496,000 square feet and is anchored by Kmart and Sears, which owns its 140,000 square foot store.

Manhattan Street Retail

Manhattan
    Street Retail is comprised of 22 properties containing 1,047,000
    square feet. These properties include 4 Union Square, which
    contains 203,000 square feet anchored by Whole Foods Market,
    Filenes Basement and DSW; the Manhattan Mall, which is under
    development and will include a new JC Penney store; 1540
    Broadway in Times Square, which contains 159,000 square feet
    anchored by Forever 21, which will open their flagship store
    in Spring 2009, and Planet Hollywood; and properties on Madison
    Avenue, and in SoHo, occupied by retailers including H&M,
    Top Shop, Madewell, the GAP, Gucci, Chloe and Cartier. In
    addition, we own 817,000 square feet of retail space in certain
    of our New York office buildings, which is part of our New
    York Office Properties segment.

Retail Properties lease terms generally range from five years or less in some instances for smaller tenant spaces to as long as 25 years for major tenants.  Leases generally provide for reimbursements of real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges (including roof and structure in strip shopping centers, unless it is the tenant’s direct responsibility), and percentage rents based on tenant sales volume.  Percentage rents accounted for less than 1% of the Retail Properties total revenues during 2008.

Office lease terms generally range from three to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 15 years for major tenants. Leases typically provide for periodic step-ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants the tenants’ share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year. Electricity is provided to tenants on a sub-metered basis or included in rent and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases. Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction of its premises.

Lease terms generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenant spaces to as long as 15 years for major tenants, and may provide for extension options at market rates. Leases typically provide for periodic step-ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants, the tenant’s share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year.  Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including the matters referred to below, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (“USDC-NJ”) claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that a prior order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York dated February 6, 2001, as modified on appeal to the District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 13, 2001, froze our right to re-allocate which effectively terminated our right to collect the additional rent from Stop & Shop. On March 3, 2003, after we
moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Stop & Shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint. On March 26, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a new complaint in New York Supreme Court, asserting substantially the same claims as in its USDC-NJ complaint. We removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In January 2005 that court remanded the action to the New York Supreme Court. On February 14, 2005, we served an answer in which we asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the
motions for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Court’s decision and on December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Court’s decision.  On January 16, 2007, we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Court’s decision which was denied on March 13, 2007.  We are currently engaged in discovery and anticipate that a trial date will be set for some time in 2009.  We intend to vigorously pursue our claims against Stop & Shop.  In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

On May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas and the 555 California Street complex.  Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties.  The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump.  In August 2005, Mr. Trump brought a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court against, among others, the general partners of the partnerships referred to above.   Mr. Trump’s claims arose out of a dispute over the sale price of and use of proceeds from, the sale of properties located on the former Penn Central rail yards between West 59th and 72nd Streets in Manhattan which were formerly
owned by the partnerships.  In decisions dated September 14, 2005 and July 24, 2006, the Court denied several of Mr. Trump’s motions and ultimately dismissed all of Mr. Trump’s claims, except for his claim seeking access to books and records.  In a decision dated October 1, 2007, the Court determined that Mr. Trump had already received access to the books and records to which he was entitled, with the exception of certain documents which were subsequently delivered to Mr. Trump.  Mr. Trump sought re-argument and renewal on, and filed a notice of appeal in connection with, his dismissed claims.  In a decision dated January 6, 2009, the Court denied all of Mr. Trump’s motions.  Mr. Trump has filed a notice appealing the 2007 and 2009 decisions.  In connection with the acquisition, we agreed to indemnify the sellers for liabilities and expenses arising out of Mr. Trump’s claim that the general partners of the partnerships we acquired did
not sell the rail yards at a fair price or could have sold the rail yards for a greater price and any other claims asserted in the legal action; provided however, that if Mr. Trump prevails on certain claims involving partnership matters, other than claims relating to sale price, the sellers will be required to reimburse us for certain costs related to those claims.  We believe that the claims relating to the sale price are without merit.  All other allegations are not asserted as a basis for damages and regardless of merit, in our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.

In July 2005, we acquired H Street Building Corporation (“H Street”) which has a subsidiary that owns, among other things, a 50% tenancy in common interest in land located in Arlington County, Virginia, known as "Pentagon Row," leased to two tenants.  In April 2007, H Street acquired the remaining 50% interest in that fee.  In April 2007, we received letters from those tenants, Street Retail, Inc. and Post Apartment Homes, L.P., claiming they had a right of first offer triggered by each of those transactions. On September 25, 2008, both tenants filed suit against us and the former owners.  The claim alleges the right to purchase the fee interest, damages in excess of $75,000,000 and punitive damages.  We believe this claim is without merit and in our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, will not have a material effect on our financial condition,
results of operation or cash flow.

On January 14, 2009, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.95 per common share, payable on March 12, 2009 in a combination of cash, not to exceed 40% in the aggregate, and Vornado common shares.  This dividend policy, continued for all of 2009, will require approximately $260,000,000 of cash for common share dividends during 2009, assuming shareholder elections to receive cash meet or exceed the aggregate cash limitations.  On February 6, 2009, there were 1,454 holders of record of our common shares.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities

During 2008, we issued 6,984 common shares upon the redemption of Class A units of the Operating Partnership held by persons who received units, in private placements in earlier periods, in exchange for their interests in limited partnerships that owned real estate. The common shares were issued without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance on Section 4 (2) of that Act.

________________________________

(1)

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is used by management, investors and industry analysts as a supplemental measure of operating performance of equity REITs. FFO should be evaluated along with GAAP net income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure), as well as cash
flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating performance of equity REITs. Management believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because this measure excludes the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, this non-GAAP measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in our Statements of Cash Flows. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance
or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

Overview

We own and operate office, retail and showroom properties (our “core” operations) with large concentrations of office and retail properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia areas. In addition, we have a 32.7% interest in Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”) which has a significant real estate component, a 32.5% interest in Alexander’s, Inc., which has seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, as well as interests in other real estate and related investments.

Our ultimate business objective is to maximize shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. The table below compares our performance to the Morgan Stanley REIT Index (“RMS”) and the SNL REIT Index (“SNL”) for the following periods ending December 31, 2008 (past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance):

We intend to achieve our ultimate business objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through:

•

Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

•

Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is high likelihood of capital appreciation;

•

Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

•

Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;

•

Investing in fully-integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate component; and

•

Developing and redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets.

We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.  See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.

In the second half of 2007 the residential mortgage and capital markets began showing signs of stress, primarily in the form of escalating default rates on sub-prime mortgages, declining home values and increasing inventory nationwide.  In 2008, the “credit crisis” spread to the broader commercial credit and financial markets resulting in illiquidity and volatility in the bond and equity markets.  We are currently in an economic recession which has negatively affected all businesses, including ours.  During the past year, real estate transactions have diminished significantly and capitalization rates have risen.  Our real estate portfolio may be affected by declining demand for office and retail space and tenant bankruptcies, which may result in lower average occupancy rates and effective rents, and a corresponding decrease in net income, funds from operations and cash flow.
In addition, the value of our assets, including investments in joint ventures, marketable securities, and mezzanine loans may also decline, and may result in impairment charges and/or valuation allowances and a corresponding decrease in net income and funds from operations.

    of service for redevelopment, although we capitalized approximately
    $63,000,000 of interest costs in connection with the development
    of these assets. Assets under development include all or

Significant Activity during 2008

Reversal of Deferred Tax Liabilities

In connection with the purchase accounting for H Street, in July 2005 and April 2007 we recorded an aggregate of $222,174,000 of deferred tax liabilities representing the differences between the tax basis and the book basis of the acquired assets and liabilities multiplied by the effective tax rate.  We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of January 16, 2008, we had completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008.  Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, we reversed the deferred tax liabilities and recognized an income tax benefit of $222,174,000 in our consolidated statement of income.

Lexington Realty Trust (“Lexington”) (NYSE:  LXP)

Prior to October 28, 2008, we owned 8,149,592 limited partnership units of the Lexington Master Limited Partnership (“Lexington MLP”) which were exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into Lexington common shares, or a 7.7% limited partnership interest.  On October 28, 2008, we acquired 8,000,000 common shares of Lexington for $5.60 per share, or $44,800,000.  The purchase price consisted of $22,400,000 in cash and a $22,400,000 margin loan recourse only to the 8,000,000 shares acquired.  In addition, we exchanged our existing limited partnership units in Lexington MLP for 8,149,592 Lexington common shares.  As of December 31, 2008, we own 16,149,592 Lexington common shares, or approximately 17.2% of Lexington’s common equity.  We account for our investment in Lexington on the equity method and record our pro rata share of Lexington’s net income or loss on a one-quarter
lag basis because we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that Lexington files its financial statements.

Based on Lexington’s December 31, 2008 closing share price of $5.00, the market value (“fair value” pursuant to SFAS 157) of our investment in Lexington was $80,748,000, or $100,707,000 below the carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet. We have concluded that our investment in Lexington is “other-than-temporarily” impaired and recorded a $100,707,000 non-cash impairment loss in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Together with the impairment charge recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2008, we recognized an aggregate of $107,882,000 of non-cash charges on our investment in Lexington during 2008.  Our conclusions were based on the recent deterioration in the capital and financial markets and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near-term.  These charges are included as a component of “(loss) income from partially owned entities,” on
our consolidated statement of income.

Marketable Securities

At December 31, 2008, we concluded that certain of our investments in marketable equity securities were “other-than-temporarily” impaired, based on the severity and duration of the declines in the market value (“fair value” pursuant to SFAS 157) of these securities and recognized non-cash impairment charges aggregating $55,471,000, based on December 31, 2008 closing share prices.  Together with impairment charges recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2008, we recognized an aggregate of $76,352,000 of non-cash impairment charges on these investments during 2008.  Our conclusions were based on the recent deterioration in the capital and financial markets and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near-term.  These charges are included as a component of “interest and other investment (loss) income, net,” on our consolidated statement of income.

Real Estate Development Projects

During 2008, we recognized non-cash charges aggregating $96,037,000, for the write-off of our share of certain partially owned entities’ development costs, as these projects were either deferred or abandoned.  These charges include $37,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2008, for our 50% share of costs in connection with the redevelopment of the Filene’s property in Boston, Massachusetts and $23,000,000 in the first quarter of 2008, for our 50% share of costs in connection with the abandonment of the “arena move”/Moynihan East portions of the Farley project. These charges are included as a component of “(loss) income from partially owned entities,” on our consolidated statement of income.

During 2008, we also recognized non-cash charges aggregating $81,447,000, of which $73,438,000 was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily related to residential condominium projects under development.


Overview – continued

MPH Mezzanine Loan

On June 5, 2007, we acquired a 42% interest in two MPH mezzanine loans totaling $158,700,000, for $66,000,000 in cash.  The loans, which were due on February 8, 2008 and have not been repaid, are subordinate to $2.9 billion of mortgage and other debt and secured by the equity interests in four New York City properties: Worldwide Plaza, 1540 Broadway office condominium, 527 Madison Avenue and Tower 56.  At December 31, 2007, we reduced the net carrying amount of the loans to $9,000,000 by recognizing a $57,000,000 non-cash charge in our consolidated statement of income.  On April 2, 2008, we sold a sub-participation interest in the loans for $19,300,000, which resulted in the reduction of our valuation allowance from $57,000,000 to $46,700,000 and the recognition of $10,300,000 of non-cash income in our consolidated statement of income.

Dispositions

On March 31, 2008, we sold our 47.6% interest in Americold, our Temperature Controlled Logistics segment, for $220,000,000, in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $112,690,000, which is included as a component of “income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest” on our consolidated statement of income.

On June 6, 2008, we sold our Tysons Dulles Plaza office building complex located in Tysons Corner, Virginia for approximately $152,800,000, in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $56,831,000, which is included as a component of “income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest” on our consolidated statement of income.

Pursuant to the sale of GMH Communities L.P. (“GMH”) military housing division and the merger of its student housing division with American Campus Communities, Inc (“ACC”) (NYSE: ACC), in June 2008 we received an aggregate of $105,180,000, consisting of $82,142,000 in cash and 753,126 shares of ACC common stock valued at $23,038,000 based on ACC’s then closing share price of $30.59, in exchange for our entire interest in GMH.  We subsequently sold all of the ACC common shares.  The above transactions resulted in a net gain of $2,038,000, which was recognized in the second quarter of 2008, and is included as a component of “net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate” on our consolidated statement of income.  The aggregate net income realized from inception of this investment in 2004 through its
disposition was $77,000,000.

Financings

During 2008 we completed approximately $1.3 billion of property level financings and repaid approximately $241,000,000 of existing debt with a portion of the proceeds. In addition, we purchased $81,540,000 (aggregate face amount) of our 4.50% senior unsecured notes due August 15, 2009, for $80,408,000 in cash, resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $783,000.  We also purchased $10,200,000 and $17,300,000 (aggregate face amounts) of our 3.63% and 2.85% convertible senior debentures, respectively, for an aggregate of $18,080,000 in cash, resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $9,037,000.  These gains are included as a reduction of “interest and debt expense” on our consolidated statement of income.

The net proceeds we received from the above dispositions and financings were used primarily for general corporate purposes.  We may seek to obtain additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings or asset sales, although there is no express policy with respect to these capital markets transactions. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities in the future.

Most leases include periodic step-ups in rent, which are not reflected in the initial rent per square foot leased.

(2)

In addition, the New York Office segment leased 13,468 square feet of retail space during the year ended December 31, 2008 at an initial rent of $205.39, a 268% increase over the prior escalated rent per square foot.

(3)

Pursuant to SFAS 141, acquired below-market leases are marked-to-market at the time of their acquisition.  Accordingly, when the space is subsequently re-leased, the cash basis rent increase is greater than the GAAP basis rent increase.


Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.  The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Real Estate

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $15.709 billion and $15.226 billion, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. If we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated.

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in-place leases and customer relationships) and acquired liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141, Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions.

Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over our anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis.  An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared.  If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, our anticipated holding period for properties, or the estimated fair value of properties change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and
such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.    The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.  Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.

Identified Intangible Assets

Upon an acquisition of a business we record intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. We amortize identified intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset, including the related real estate when appropriate, is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets, a component of “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets, were $525,950,000 and $563,359,000, respectively. In addition, the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of “deferred credit” on our consolidated balance sheets, were $719,822,000 and $814,098,000, respectively. If the intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, or the estimated useful lives of finite-life intangibles assets or liabilities change, the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material.


Critical Accounting Policies – continued

Mezzanine Loans Receivable

We invest in mezzanine loans to entities which have significant real estate assets.  These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate.  We record investments in mezzanine loans at the stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying amounts of “mezzanine loans receivable” were $472,539,000 and $492,339,000, respectively. We accrete or amortize any discounts or premiums over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest method, or straight-line method if the result is not materially different. We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans, if circumstances warrant, in determining whether they are impaired. A
loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the estimated fair value of the loan or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If our estimates of the collectibility of both interest and principal or the fair value of our loans change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Partially Owned Entities

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying amounts of investments and advances to partially owned entities, including Alexander’s and Toys “R” Us, were $1.083 billion and $1.505 billion, respectively. In determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we will absorb the majority of the entity’s expected losses, if they occur, or receive the majority of the expected residual returns, if they occur, or both. We account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not
met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method.

Our investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary.  If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities are planned, and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.    The evaluation of anticipated cash
flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.

Allowance For Doubtful Accounts

We periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts ($32,834,000 and $19,151,000 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents ($5,773,000 and $3,076,000 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007). This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.


Critical Accounting Policies – continued

Revenue Recognition

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:

•

Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.  We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use.  In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

•

Percentage Rent — income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold. These rents are recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104:

Revenue Recognition

, which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., sales thresholds have been achieved).

•

Hotel Revenue — income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered.

•

Trade Shows Revenue — income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred.

•

Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.

•

Management, Leasing and Other Fees — income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.

Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among other things, its collectibility. If our assessment of the collectibility of revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material.

Income Taxes

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, or fail to meet other REIT requirements, we may fail to qualify as a REIT which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences.


Recently Issued Accounting Literature

In
    September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Statement No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”).

SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 was effective for our financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008.  The FASB has deferred the implementation of the provisions of SFAS 157 relating to certain non-financial assets and liabilities until January 1, 2009. This standard did not materially affect how we determine fair value, but resulted in certain additional disclosures.  SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes
  observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels: Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities; Level 2 – observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3 – unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in our consolidated financial statements primarily consist of (i) marketable securities, (ii) the assets of our deferred compensation plan (primarily
  marketable securities and equity investments in limited partnerships), for which there is a corresponding liability on our consolidated balance sheets and (iii) Class A units of the Operating Partnership, held by third-parties.  Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2008 are presented in the table below based on their level in the fair value hierarchy.

The fair value of Level 3 “deferred compensation plan assets” represents equity investments in certain limited partnerships, for which there is a corresponding Level 3 liability to the plan’s participants.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, which permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at  fair value.  SFAS 159 was effective  on January 1, 2008.  We did not elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial instruments on the effective date and have not determined whether we will elect this option for any eligible financial instruments we acquire in the future.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141R,

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141R”).  SFAS 141R broadens the guidance of SFAS 141, extending its applicability to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses.  SFAS 141R also broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and interests transferred as a result of business combinations; and acquisition related costs will generally be expensed rather than included as part of the basis of the acquisition.  SFAS 141R expands required disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for all transactions entered into on or after January 1, 2009.  The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 could
materially impact our future financial results to the extent that we acquire significant amounts of real estate, in part because acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred compared to our current practice of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life of the assets acquired.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No.
 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
 Financial Statements - An Amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS
 160”).  SFAS 160 requires a noncontrolling interest in
 a subsidiary to be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated
 net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest
 to be identified in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS
 160 also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes
 in the parent’s ownership interest and requires fair value
 measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained
 in a deconsolidation. As of December 31, 2008, as part of our
 preparation for the adoption of SFAS 160, which is effective
 for us on January 1, 2009, we have retroactively adopted the
 measurement provisions of EITF Topic D-98,

Classification
  and Measurement of Redeemable Securities

.
  Upon adoption, we adjusted the carrying amounts of the Class
  A units held by third parties, a component of “minority
  interest” on
  our consolidated balance sheets, by recognizing a $639,447,000
  increase to the January 1, 2006 balance of “minority interest” and
a corresponding decrease in  “earnings in excess of (less
than) distributions” which ws accounted for a cumulative
effect adjustment on January 1, 2006.   Subsequent
adjustments to the carrying amounts of the Class A units, to
reflect their redemption value at the end of each reporting period,
were recorded to “additional
capital.”   The
adoption of SFAS 160 on January 1, 2009, will not result in the
re-classification of the carrying amounts of the Class A units
held by third parties to a component within “shareholders’ equity.”

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities – an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133

(“SFAS 161”)

.

SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities, including disclosures regarding how an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FASB Statement No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

and the impact of derivative instruments and related hedged items on an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows.  SFAS 161 is effective on January 1, 2009.  We believe that the adoption of this standard on
January 1, 2009 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.


Recently Issued Accounting Literature - continued

In May 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. APB 14-1,

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that may be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)

, (the “FSP”), which is effective for us on January 1, 2009 and requires retroactive application.  The adoption of this FSP will affect the accounting for our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures and Series D-13 convertible preferred units.  The FSP requires the initial proceeds from the sale of our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures and Series D-13 convertible preferred units to be allocated between a liability component and an equity component.  The resulting discount will be amortized using the effective interest method over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding as additional interest expense.  The adoption of the
FSP on January 1, 2009 will result in the recognition of an aggregate unamortized debt discount of $139,937,000 (as of December 31, 2008) in our consolidated balance sheets and additional interest expense in our consolidated statements of income.  Our current estimate of the incremental interest expense, net of minority interest, for each reporting period is as follows:

In May 2008, the FASB issued  Statement No. 163,

Accounting for Financial Guarantee Insurance Contracts

(“SFAS 163”).  SFAS 163 was issued to decrease inconsistencies within Statement No. 60,

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises

, and clarify how it applies to financial guarantee insurance contracts issued by insurance enterprises, including the recognition of premium revenue and claim liabilities.  SFAS 163 also requires expanded disclosures about financial guarantee insurance contracts.  SFAS 163 is effective on January 1, 2009.  We believe that the adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock (“EITF 07-5”). Paragraph 11(a) of SFAS 133 specifies that a contract that would otherwise meet the definition of a derivative but is both (a) indexed to the Company’s own stock and (b) classified in stockholders’ equity in the statement of financial position would not be considered a derivative financial instrument. EITF 07-5 provides a new two-step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer’s own stock and thus able to qualify for the SFAS 133 paragraph 11(a) scope exception. EITF 07-5 is effective on January 1, 2009.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.

Net income and EBITDA

(1)

by Segment for the Years Ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 – continued

Notes to the preceding tabular information:

(1)

EBITDA represents “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.”  Management considers EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the un-levered performance of its segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)

As of January 1, 2008, we transferred the operations and financial results related to 409 3

rd

Street, NW (Washington Office Center) from the Merchandise Mart segment to the Washington, DC Office segment for both the current and prior periods presented.

(3)

Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax (benefit) expense in the reconciliation of net income to EBITDA include our share of these items from partially owned entities.

(4)

Other EBITDA is comprised of:

(1)

Results from an $11,715 increase in BMS operating expenses and a $12,792 increase in property level operating expenses.

(2)

Includes $6,990 of write-offs for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents and $2,492 of bad debt expense, all relating to tenants that filed for bankruptcy.  Of these amounts, $3,931 and $1,203, respectively, relate to Circuit City.

(3)

Primarily due to higher bad debt expense, partially offset by lower real estate taxes.

(4)

Results primarily from an increase in the elimination of inter-company fees of our operating segments upon consolidation.

(5)

Primarily due to a $15,344 reduction from the mark-to-market of investments in our deferred compensation plan (for which there is a corresponding reduction in “interest and other investment (loss) income, net”), partially offset by a $4,600 pension termination cost, higher compensation expense and professional fees.

Income Applicable to Alexander’s

Our 32.5% share of income applicable to Alexander’s (comprised of our share of Alexander’s net income, management, leasing and development fees) was $36,671,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $50,589,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $13,918,000. The decrease was primarily due to $6,583,000 of income for our share of the reversal of accrued stock appreciation rights compensation expense, compared to $14,280,000 in the prior year.

Income (loss) Applicable to Toys

Our 32.7% share of Toys’ financial results (comprised of our share of Toys’ net income, interest income on loans receivable, and management fees) for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 are for Toys fiscal periods from November 4, 2007 to November 1, 2008 and October 29, 2006 to November 3, 2007, respectively.  In the year ended December 31, 2008, our income applicable to Toys was $2,380,000, or $62,032,000 before our share of Toys’ income tax expense, compared to a loss of $14,337,000 or $25,235,000 before our share of Toys’ income tax benefit in the prior year.

Includes $107,882 of non-cash impairment charges.  See “Overview” page 69 for details.

(2)

As of November 13, 2008, our joint venture partner’s failure to contribute its pro rata share of required capital resulted in our ability under the joint venture agreement to assert unilateral control over major business decisions and accordingly, we began to consolidate our investment pursuant to Accounting Research Bulletin 51,

Consolidated Financial Statements.

(3)

Includes $4,100 for the reversal of a non-cash charge recorded by the joint venture in prior periods which, pursuant to paragraph 19(n) of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 18,

The Equity Method of Accounting For Investments In Common Stock

, should have been eliminated in the determination of our share of the earnings of the venture.  In addition, in accordance with EITF 99-10, during the quarter ended September 30, 2008 our partner’s capital account was reduced to zero and, accordingly, we recognized $1,528 of additional net loss for the portion that related to our partner’s pro rata share of the venture’s net loss.

(4)

In June 2008, we sold our interest in GMH Communities L.P.

(5)

As of April 30, 2007, our H Street subsidiary, acquired the remaining 50% interest in these entities and began to consolidate this investment into our consolidated financial statements and no longer account for it under the equity method.

Includes non-cash asset write-downs aggregating $96,037,000.  See “Overview” page 69 for details.

Interest and debt expense was $586,358,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $569,386,000 in the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $16,972,000.  This increase was primarily due to an $812 million increase in average outstanding debt from property financings and refinancings, partially offset by a $9,820,000 net gain on early extinguishment of debt.

Net Gains on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate

Net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate was $7,757,000 in the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $39,493,000 in the year ended December 31, 2007.  The year ended December 31, 2008 includes a $3,691,000 pre-tax gain on sale of residential condominiums, a $2,038,000 net gain on disposition of our 13.8% interest in GMH and $2,028,000 for net gains on sale of marketable securities.  The $39,493,000 net gain in the year ended December 31, 2007 represents net gains on sale of marketable securities, including $23,090,000 from the sale of McDonald’s common shares.

Minority Interest of Partially Owned Entities

Minority interest of partially owned entities was income of $3,263,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to income of $3,494,000 in the prior year, a change of $231,000.  Minority interest of partially owned entities represents the minority partners’ pro rata share of the net income or loss of consolidated partially owned entities, including 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 555 California Street, 220 Central Park South, the Springfield Mall, and the Wasserman ventures.

Income Tax Expense

In the year ended December 31, 2008, we had an income tax benefit of $204,537,000, compared to an expense of $9,179,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $213,716,000.  The decrease results primarily from a $222,174,000 reversal of deferred taxes recorded in connection with the acquisition of H Street.  We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of January 16, 2008, we had completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008.  Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, we reversed the deferred tax liabilities and recognized an income tax benefit of $222,174,000 in our consolidated statement of income.

Discontinued Operations

The combined results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 include the operating results of Americold, which was sold on March 31, 2008; Tysons Dulles Plaza, which was sold on June 10, 2008; 19.6 acres of land we acquired as part of our acquisition of H Street, of which 11 acres were sold in September 2007; Vineland, New Jersey, which was sold on July 16, 2007; Crystal Mall Two, which was sold on August 9, 2007; Arlington Plaza, which was sold on October 17, 2007.

Perpetual
    preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership
    were $22,084,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared

Preferred Share Dividends

Preferred share dividends were $57,091,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $57,177,000 for the prior year.

Notes to preceding tabular information:

($ in thousands)

(1)

Primarily from a (i) $13,885 increase in operating expenses of Building Maintenance Services, Inc. (“BMS”), a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering services to New York Office properties (the corresponding increase in BMS revenues is included in “other income”), (ii) $8,992 increase in property level costs and (iii) $7,553 write-off of straight line rent receivable in connection with lease terminations.

(2)

Primarily from (i) a $6,940 increase in property level operating costs, (ii) $2,000 due to a reassessment of 2006 real estate taxes in 2007 and (iii) a $4,050 reversal of a reserve for bad debts in 2006.

(3)

Represents the elimination of inter-company fees from operating segments upon consolidation.  See note 2 on page 89.

(4)

H Street litigation costs in 2006.

(5)

Primarily from (i) $4,835 of administrative and organization expenses of the India Property Fund, in which we were a 50.6% partner as of December 31, 2007 (because we consolidated the India Property Fund during 2007, the minority share of these expenses is included in minority interest on our consolidated statement of income), and (ii) $1,880 of general and administrative expenses of 555 California Street from the date of acquisition.

(6)

Primarily from a (i) $5,465 decrease in franchise taxes and donations, (ii) $4,420 decrease in medicare taxes resulting from stock option exercises and the termination of a rabbi trust, partially offset by, (iii) an $8,245 increase in stock-based compensation.

Income Applicable to Alexander’s

Income applicable to Alexander’s (loan interest income, management, leasing, development and commitment fees, and equity in income) was $50,589,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to a loss of $14,530,000 for the prior year, an increase of $65,119,000. The increase was primarily due to (i) our $14,280,000 share of income in 2007 for the reversal of accrued stock appreciation rights compensation expense as compared to $49,043,000 for our share of expense in the prior year, (ii) an increase of $3,504,000 in our equity in earnings of Alexander’s before stock appreciation rights and net gains on sales of condominiums, (iii) an increase of $3,758,000 in development fees in 2007, partially offset by (iv) our $4,580,000 share of Alexander’s net gain on sale of 731 Lexington Avenue condominiums in the prior year and (v) a $1,305,000 decrease in leasing fee income.

Loss Applicable to Toys

Our 32.7% share of Toys’ financial results (comprised of our share of Toys’ net loss, interest income on loans receivable, and management fees) for the years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 are for Toys fiscal periods from October 29, 2006 to November 3, 2007 and October 30, 2005 to October 28, 2006, respectively.  In the year ended December 31, 2007, our loss applicable to Toys was $14,337,000, or $25,235,000 before our share of Toys’ income tax benefit, as compared to $47,520,000 or $70,147,000 before our share of Toys’ income tax benefit in the prior year.  The decrease in our loss applicable to Toys’ before income tax benefit of $44,912,000 results primarily from (i) an increase in Toys’ net sales due to improvements in comparable store sales across all divisions and benefits in foreign currency translation, (ii) a net gain related to a
lease termination, (iii) decreased interest expense primarily due to reduced borrowings and reduced amortization of deferred financing costs, partially offset by, (iv) an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, which as a percentage of net sales were 27.7% and 26.4% for the twelve month periods ended November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006, respectively, as a result of higher payroll, store occupancy, corporate and advertising expenses.

__________________________

(1)

On April 30, 2007, we acquired the corporations that own the remaining 50% interest in these assets and began to consolidate the accounts of these entities into our consolidated financial statements and no longer account for them under the equity method.  Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2006 these corporations were contesting our acquisition of H Street and impeded our access to their financial information.  Accordingly, we were unable to record our pro rata share of their earnings.  2006 includes $3,890 for our 50% share of their earnings for the period from July 20, 2005 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2005.

(2)

We recorded our pro rata share of GMH’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because we filed our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that GCT filed its financial statements.  On July 31, 2006 GCT filed its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, which restated the quarterly financial results of each of the first three quarters of 2005.  On September 15, 2006 GCT filed its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006.  Accordingly, “equity in net income or loss from partially owned entities” for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes a net loss of $1,013, which consists of (i) a $94 net loss representing our share of GMH’s 2005 fourth quarter results, including adjustments to restate its first three quarters of 2005 and (ii) a
net loss of $919 for our share of GMH’s earnings through September 30, 2006.

(3)

On January 1, 2007, we began recording our pro rata share of Lexington MLP’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that Lexington files its financial statements.  Prior to the January 1, 2007, we recorded our pro rata share of Newkirk MLP’s (Lexington MLP’s predecessor) quarterly earnings current in our same quarter. Accordingly, our “equity in net income or loss from partially owned entities” for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes our share of Lexington MLP’s net income or loss for the nine month period from January 1, 2007 through September 30, 2007.

The
            decrease in our share of earnings from the prior
            year is primarily due to (i) 2007 including our share
            of Lexington MLP’s first, second and third quarter
            results (lag basis) compared to 2006 including our
            share of Newkirk MLP’s full year results, (ii)
            higher depreciation expense and amortization of above
            market lease intangibles in the current year as a
            result of Lexington’s purchase price accounting
            adjustments in connection with the merger of Newkirk
            MLP on December 31, 2006, (iii) $10,842 for our share
            of net gains on sale of real estate in 2006 and (iv)
            a $10,362 net gain recognized in 2006 as a result
            of the acquisition of Newkirk by Lexington.

(4)

Includes our equity in net earnings of partially owned entities, including partially owned office buildings in New York and Washington, DC, the Monmouth Mall, Dune Capital LP, Verde Group LLC, and others.

    to $255,391,000 in the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease

Interest and debt expense was $569,386,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $394,571,000 in the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $174,815,000.  This increase was primarily due to (i) $80,255,000 from approximately $1.713 billion of mortgage financings and refinancings on our existing property portfolio during 2007 and 2006, (ii) $67,780,000 from a $1.754 billion of mortgage debt resulting from property acquisitions, (iii) $70,432,000 from senior unsecured financings, including $1.0 billion issued in November 2006 and $1.4 billion issued in March 2007, partially offset by, (iv) an increase of $28,240,000 in the amount of capitalized interest relating to a larger amount of assets under development in 2007, (v) $19,344,000 less interest in 2007 from the redemption of $500,000,000 of senior unsecured notes in May 2007, and (vi) $3,582,000 of expense in 2006 from
early extinguishments of debt.

Net Gains on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate

Net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate was $39,493,000 and $76,073,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and consists primarily of net gains from sales of marketable equity securities, including $23,090,000 from the sale of McDonalds common shares in 2007 and $55,438,000 from the sale of Sears Canada common shares in 2006.

Minority Interest of Partially Owned Entities

Minority interest of partially owned entities was income of $3,494,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to income of $1,363,000 in the prior year, a change of $2,131,000.  Minority interest of partially owned entities represents the minority partners’ pro rata share of the net income or loss of consolidated partially owned entities, including 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 555 California Street, India Property Fund, 220 Central Park South, Wasserman and the Springfield Mall.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense was $9,179,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $491,000 for the prior year, an increase of $8,688,000.  This increase results primarily from (i) the consolidation of two H Street corporations beginning on April 30, 2007, the date we acquired the remaining 50% of these corporations we did not previously own (we previously accounted for our 50% investment on the equity method) and (ii) $4,622,000 of Federal withholding tax on dividends paid to foreign corporations in connection with 1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street, which we acquired in May 2007.

Discontinued Operations

The combined results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 include the operating results of Americold; Tysons Dulles Plaza; 19.6 acres of land we acquired as part of our acquisition of H Street, of which 11 acres were sold in September 2007; Vineland, New Jersey, which was sold on July 16, 2007; Crystal Mall Two, which was sold on August 9, 2007; Arlington Plaza, which was sold on October 17, 2007; 33 North Dearborn Street in Chicago, Illinois, which was sold on March 14, 2006; 424 Sixth Avenue in New York City, which was sold on March 13, 2006 and 1919 South Eads Street in Arlington, Virginia, which was sold on June 22, 2006.

This decrease results primarily from a lower minority ownership in the Operating Partnership due to the conversion of Class A Operating Partnership units into our common shares during 2007 and 2006.

Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions of the Operating Partnership

Perpetual preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership were $19,274,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $21,848,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $2,574,000. This decrease resulted primarily from the redemption of $45,000,000 Series D-9 preferred units and the write-off of $1,125,000 of Series D-9 issuance costs in October 2006.

____________________________

(1) Represents the increase (decrease) in property-level operations which were owned for the same period in each year and excludes the effect of property acquisitions, dispositions and other non-operating items that affect comparability, including divisional general and administrative expenses. We utilize this measure to make decisions on whether to buy or sell properties as well as to compare the performance of our properties to that of our peers. Same store operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarter-by-quarter net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys’ fourth quarter net income, which we recorded on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. The Merchandise Mart segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage rental income.

Related Party Transactions

Loans and Compensation Agreements

On March 26, 2007, Joseph Macnow, Executive Vice President – Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, repaid to the Company his $2,000,000 outstanding loan which was scheduled to mature June 2007.

Effective as of April 19, 2007, we entered into a new employment agreement with Mitchell Schear, the President of our Washington, DC Office segment.  This agreement, which replaced his prior agreement, was approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Trustees and provides for a term of five years and is automatically renewable for one-year terms thereafter.  The agreement also provides for a minimum salary of $1,000,000 per year and bonuses and other customary benefits.  Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on April 19, 2007, the Compensation Committee granted options to Mr. Schear to acquire 200,000 of our common shares at an exercise price of $119.94 per share.  These options vest ratably over three years beginning in 2010 and accelerate on a change of control or if we terminate his employment without cause or by him for breach by us.  The agreement also provides that if
we terminate Mr. Schear’s employment without cause or by him for breach by us, he will receive a lump-sum payment equal to one year’s salary and bonus, up to a maximum of $2,000,000.

Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees

Alexander’s

We own 32.5% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President, are officers and directors of Alexander’s.  We provide various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements.  These agreements are described in Note 6 - Investments in Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

On September 9, 2008, Alexander’s Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $7.00 per share, payable on October 30, 2008, to shareholders of record on October 14, 2008.  The dividend was attributable to the liquidation of the wholly owned 731 Lexington Avenue taxable REIT subsidiary into Alexander’s.  Accordingly, on October 30, we received $11,578,000, which was accounted for as a reduction of our investment in Alexander’s.

On September 15, 2008 and October 14, 2008, Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, who holds the same positions in Alexander’s, exercised an aggregate of 200,000 of his SARs, which were scheduled to expire on March 4, 2009, and received gross proceeds of $62,809,000.

On March 13, 2007, Michael Fascitelli, our President, who also holds the same position in Alexander’s, exercised 350,000 of his SARs, which were scheduled to expire on March 14, 2007, and he received gross proceeds of $50,465,000.

Interstate Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board and Chief Executive Officer, is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s, are Interstate’s two other partners. As of December 31, 2008, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned approximately 8.8% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 27.0% of Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days’ notice at the end of the term. We believe based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies that the management agreement terms are fair to us. We earned $803,000, $800,000 and $798,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures.  Capital requirements for significant acquisitions and development expenditures may require funding from borrowings and/or equity offerings.

Acquisitions and Investments

There were no material real estate acquisitions or investments in partially owned entities and mezzanine loans during 2008.  During 2007, we completed approximately $4,045,400,000 of real estate acquisitions and $217,081,000 mezzanine loans.  These acquisitions and investments were consummated through our subsidiaries and were financed with available cash, mortgage indebtedness, and/or the issuance of operating partnership equity. The related assets, liabilities and results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Excluding our acquisition of a 70% interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street in May 2007, none of the acquisitions, individually or in the aggregate, were material to our historical consolidated financial statements.  Details of our 2007 acquisitions and investments are summarized below.

100 West 33

rd

Street, New York City (the “Manhattan Mall”)

On January 10, 2007, we acquired the Manhattan Mall for approximately $689,000,000 in cash.  This mixed-use property is located on the entire Sixth Avenue block-front between 32

nd

and 33

rd

Streets in Manhattan and contains approximately 1,000,000 square feet, including 845,000 square feet of office space and 164,000 square feet of retail space. Included as part of the acquisition were 250,000 square feet of additional air rights.  The property is adjacent to our Hotel Pennsylvania.

Bruckner Plaza, Bronx, New York

On January 11, 2007, we acquired the Bruckner Plaza shopping center, containing 386,000 square feet, for approximately $165,000,000 in cash.  Also included as part of the acquisition was an adjacent parcel which is ground leased to a third party.  The property is located on Bruckner Boulevard in the Bronx, New York.

Filene’s, Boston, Massachusetts

On January 26, 2007, a joint venture in which we have a 50% interest, acquired the Filene’s property located in the Downtown Crossing district of Boston, Massachusetts for approximately $100,000,000 in cash, of which our share was $50,000,000.

H Street Building Corporation (“H Street”)

In July 2005, we acquired H Street, which owns a 50% interest in real estate assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia and Washington, DC.  On April 30, 2007, we acquired the corporations that own the remaining 50% interest in these assets for approximately $383,000,000, consisting of $322,000,000 in cash and $61,000,000 of existing mortgages.  These assets include twin office buildings located in Washington, DC, containing 577,000 square feet, and assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia, comprised of 34 acres of land leased to three residential and retail operators, a 1,680 unit high-rise apartment complex and 10 acres of vacant land.

Further, we agreed to sell approximately 19.6 of the 34 acres of land to one of the existing ground lessees in two closings over a two-year period for approximately $220,000,000.  On May 11, 2007, we closed on the sale of 11 of the 19.6 acres for $104,000,000 and received $5,000,000 in cash and a $99,000,000 short-term note.  On September 28, 2007, the buyer pre-paid the note in cash and we recognized a net gain of $4,803,000.

Our total purchase price for 100% of the assets we will own, after the anticipated proceeds from the land sales, is $409,000,000, consisting of $286,000,000 in cash and $123,000,000 of existing mortgages.


Liquidity and Capital Resources – continued

1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street

On May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas, a 2,000,000 square foot Manhattan office building located on the block-front between 51

st

and 52

nd

Street on Avenue of the Americas, and the three- building 555 California Street complex (“555 California Street”) containing 1,800,000 square feet, known as the Bank of America Center, located at California and Montgomery Streets in San Francisco’s financial district.  The purchase price for our 70% interest in the real estate was approximately $1.8 billion, consisting of $1.0 billion of cash and $797,000,000 of existing debt.  Our share of the debt was comprised of $308,000,000 secured by 1290 Avenue of the Americas and $489,000,000 secured by 555 California Street.  Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign
companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties.  The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump.

Shopping Center Portfolio Acquisition

On June 26, 2007, we entered into an agreement to acquire a portfolio of 15 shopping centers aggregating approximately 1.9 million square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $351,000,000.  The properties are located primarily in Northern New Jersey and Long Island, New York.  We have completed the acquisition of nine of these properties for an aggregate purchase price of $250,478,000, consisting of $109,279,000 in cash, $49,599,000 in Vornado Realty L.P. preferred units, $12,460,000 of Vornado Realty L.P. common units and $79,140,000 of existing mortgage debt.  We determined not to complete the acquisition of the remaining six properties and expensed $2,700,000 for costs of acquisitions not consummated on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007.

BNA Complex

On August 9, 2007, we acquired a three building complex from The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. (“BNA”) for $111,000,000 in cash.  The complex contains approximately 300,000 square feet and is located in Washington’s West End between Georgetown and the Central Business District.  We plan to convert two of these buildings to rental apartments.  Simultaneously with the acquisition, we sold Crystal Mall Two, a 277,000 square foot office building located at 1801 South Bell Street in Crystal City, to BNA for $103,600,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $19,893,000.

Dividends and Distributions

On January 14, 2009, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.95 per common share, payable on March 12, 2009 in a combination of cash, not to exceed 40% in the aggregate, and Vornado common shares.  This dividend policy, continued for all of 2009, will require approximately $260,000,000 of cash for common share dividends during 2009, assuming shareholder elections to receive cash meet or exceed the aggregate cash limitations.  In addition, we expect to pay cash dividends on outstanding preferred shares during 2009 aggregating approximately $57,000,000.

Interest on variable rate debt is computed using rates in effect at December 31, 2008.

We may from time to time purchase or retire outstanding debt securities though cash purchases and/or exchanges for our equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.  Such purchases and/or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors.  The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

We believe that we have complied with the financial covenants required by our revolving credit facilities and our senior unsecured notes, and that as of December 31, 2008 we have the ability to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness.  We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity securities and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a “well-known seasoned issuer.”

Our credit facilities contain financial covenants, that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.


Liquidity and Capital Resources – continued

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations – continued

During 2008, we purchased an aggregate of $109,040,000 of our senior unsecured notes and convertible senior debentures, for $98,488,000 in cash.  In addition, we completed approximately $1.3 billion of property level mortgage financings and repaid $241,000,000 of existing debt.  During 2007, we completed approximately $1.4 billion of senior unsecured financings and $1.111 billion of property level mortgage financings and repaid $912,674,000 of existing debt.  The net proceeds we received from 2008 and 2007 financings were used primarily for general corporate purposes and to fund acquisitions and investments unless otherwise noted.  Details of our 2008 financing activities are summarized in the Overview of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Details of our 2007 financing activities are summarized below.

2.85% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2027

On March 21, 2007, we sold $1.4 billion aggregate face amount of 2.85% convertible senior debentures due 2027, pursuant to an effective registration statement.  The aggregate net proceeds from this offering, after underwriters’ discounts and expenses, were approximately $1.37 billion.  The debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in 2012 for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures in 2012, 2017, and 2022 and in certain other limited circumstances.  The debentures are convertible, under certain circumstances, for cash and Vornado common shares at an initial conversion rate of 6.1553 common shares per $1,000 of principal amount of debentures.  The initial conversion price was $162.46, which represented a premium of 30% over the March 21, 2007 closing price for our common
shares. The principal amount of debentures will be settled for cash and the amount in excess of the principal defined as the conversion value will be settled in cash or, at our election, Vornado common shares.

The net proceeds of the offering were contributed to the Operating Partnership in the form of an inter-company loan and the Operating Partnership guaranteed the payment of the debentures.

Revolving Credit Facility

On September 28, 2007, the Operating Partnership entered into a new $1.510 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which was increased by $85,000,000 on October 12, 2007 and can be increased to up to $2.0 billion during the initial term.  The new facility has a three-year term with two one-year extension options, bears interest at LIBOR plus 55 basis points, based on our current credit ratings and requires the payment of an annual facility fee of 15 basis points.  Together with the existing $0.965 billion credit facility, the Operating Partnership has an aggregate of $2.56 billion of unsecured revolving credit.  Vornado is the guarantor of the Operating Partnership’s obligations under both revolving credit agreements.   The existing $0.965 billion credit facility’s financial covenants were modified to conform to the financial covenants under the new
agreement.   Significant modifications included (i) changing the definition of Capitalization Value to exclude corporate unallocated general and administrative expenses and to reducing the capitalization rate to 6.5% from 7.5%, and (ii) changing the definition of Total Outstanding Indebtedness to exclude indebtedness of unconsolidated joint ventures.   Under the new agreement, “Equity Value” may not be less than Three Billion Dollars; “Total Outstanding Indebtedness” may not exceed sixty percent (60%) of “Capitalization Value;” the ratio of “Combined EBITDA” to “Fixed Charges,” each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not be less than 1.40 to 1.00; the ratio of “Unencumbered Combined EBITDA” to “Unsecured Interest Expense,” each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not be less than 1.50 to 1.00; at any time, “Unsecured
Indebtedness” may not exceed sixty percent (60%) of “Capitalization Value of Unencumbered Assets;” and the ratio of “Secured Indebtedness” to “Capitalization Value,” each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not exceed fifty percent (50%).   The new agreement also contains standard representations and warranties and other covenants.  The terms in quotations in this paragraph are all defined in the new agreement, which was filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 28, 2007, filed on October 4, 2007.

Insurance

We carry commercial liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) “acts of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (“TRIPRA”) , which expires in December 2014, and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to our assets.  Our New York Office, Washington, DC Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart divisions have $2.0 billion of per occurrence all risk property insurance coverage, including terrorism coverage in effect through September 15, 2009.  Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $150,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, and a $150,000,000 annual aggregate.

In June 2007 we formed Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, to act as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage and as a direct insurer for coverage for “certified” acts of terrorism and for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by TRIPRA.  Coverage for “certified” acts of terrorism is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC.  Prior to the formation of PPIC, we were uninsured for NBCR losses.  Subsequently, we have $2.0 billion of NBCR coverage under TRIPRA, for which PPIC is responsible for 15% of each NBCR loss and the insurance company deductible of $1,000,000.   We are ultimately responsible for any loss borne by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties (which are generally non-recourse to us), senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance and/or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

We are committed to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $213,352,000. Of this amount, $80,923,000 is committed to IPF and is pledged as collateral to IPF’s lender.

From time to time, we have disposed of substantial amounts of real estate to third parties for which, as to certain properties, we remain contingently liable for rent payments or mortgage indebtedness that we cannot quantify.

Litigation

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including the matters referred to below, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (“USDC-NJ”) claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that a prior order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York dated February 6, 2001, as modified on appeal to the District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 13, 2001, froze our right to re-allocate which effectively terminated our right to collect the additional rent from Stop & Shop. On March 3, 2003, after we
moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Stop & Shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint. On March 26, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a new complaint in New York Supreme Court, asserting substantially the same claims as in its USDC-NJ complaint. We removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In January 2005 that court remanded the action to the New York Supreme Court. On February 14, 2005, we served an answer in which we asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the
motions for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Court’s decision and on December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Court’s decision.  On January 16, 2007, we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Court’s decision which was denied on March 13, 2007.  We are currently engaged in discovery and anticipate that a trial date will be set for some time in 2009.  We intend to vigorously pursue our claims against Stop & Shop.  In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

On May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas and the 555 California Street complex.  Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties.  The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump.  In August 2005, Mr. Trump brought a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court against, among others, the general partners of the partnerships referred to above.   Mr. Trump’s claims arose out of a dispute over the sale price of and use of proceeds from, the sale of properties located on the former Penn Central rail yards between West 59th and 72nd Streets in Manhattan which were formerly
owned by the partnerships.  In decisions dated September 14, 2005 and July 24, 2006, the Court denied several of Mr. Trump’s motions and ultimately dismissed all of Mr. Trump’s claims, except for his claim seeking access to books and records.  In a decision dated October 1, 2007, the Court determined that Mr. Trump had already received access to the books and records to which he was entitled, with the exception of certain documents which were subsequently delivered to Mr. Trump.  Mr. Trump sought re-argument and renewal on, and filed a notice of appeal in connection with, his dismissed claims.  In a decision dated January 6, 2009, the Court denied all of Mr. Trump’s motions.  Mr. Trump has filed a notice appealing the 2007 and 2009 decisions.  In connection with the acquisition, we agreed to indemnify the sellers for liabilities and expenses arising out of Mr. Trump’s claim that the general partners of the partnerships we acquired did
not sell the rail yards at a fair price or could have sold the rail yards for a greater price and any other claims asserted in the legal action; provided however, that if Mr. Trump prevails on certain claims involving partnership matters, other than claims relating to sale price, the sellers will be required to reimburse us for certain costs related to those claims.  We believe that the claims relating to the sale price are without merit.  All other allegations are not asserted as a basis for damages and regardless of merit, in our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.

In July 2005, we acquired H Street Building Corporation (“H Street”) which has a subsidiary that owns, among other things, a 50% tenancy in common interest in land located in Arlington County, Virginia, known as "Pentagon Row," leased to two tenants.  In April 2007, H Street acquired the remaining 50% interest in that fee.  In April 2007, we received letters from those tenants, Street Retail, Inc. and Post Apartment Homes, L.P., claiming they had a right of first offer triggered by each of those transactions. On September 25, 2008, both tenants filed suit against us and the former owners.  The claim alleges the right to purchase the fee interest, damages in excess of $75,000,000 and punitive damages.  We believe this claim is without merit and in our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, will not have a material effect on our financial condition,
results of operation or cash flow.


Liquidity and Capital Resources – continued

Cash Flow for the Year Ended December 31, 2008

Property rental income is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties.   Other sources of liquidity to fund cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, and our revolving credit facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity; and asset sales.  Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, distributions to common and preferred shareholders, as well as acquisition and development costs.  Our cash and cash equivalents were $1,526,853,000 at December 31, 2008, a $372,258,000 increase over the balance at December 31, 2007.  This increase resulted from $817,812,000 of net cash provided by operating activities and $7,677,000 of net cash provided by financing activities, partially offset by
$453,231,000 of net cash used in investing activities.  Property rental income represents our primary source of net cash provided by operating activities.

Our consolidated outstanding debt was $12,649,086,000 at December 31, 2008, a $753,048,000 increase over the balance at December 31, 2007.  This increase resulted primarily from debt associated with property refinancings.  As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, $358,468,000 and $405,656,000, respectively, was outstanding under our revolving credit facilities.  During 2009 and 2010, $453,530,000 and $1,096,941,000 of our outstanding debt matures, respectively. We may refinance such debt or choose to repay all or a portion, using existing cash balances or our revolving credit facilities.

Our share of debt of unconsolidated subsidiaries was $3,196,585,000 at December 31, 2008, a $93,288,000 decrease from the balance at December 31, 2007.

Cash flows provided by operating activities of $817,812,000 was primarily comprised of (i) net income of $395,043,000, (ii) $417,973,000 of non-cash adjustments, including depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash impairment losses, the effect of straight-lining of rental income, equity in net income of partially owned entities, minority interest expense, and (iii) distributions of income from partially owned entities of $44,690,000, partially offset by (iv) the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $39,894,000.

Net cash used in investing activities of $453,231,000 was primarily comprised of (i) development and redevelopment expenditures of $598,688,000, (ii) additions to real estate of $207,885,000, (iii) investments in partially owned entities of $156,227,000, (iv) purchases of marketable equity securities of $164,886,000, partially offset by, (v) proceeds from the sale of real estate (primarily Americold and Tysons Dulles Plaza) of $390,468,000, (vi) distributions of capital from partially owned entities of $218,367,000, (vii) proceeds received from repayments on mezzanine loans receivable of $52,470,000 and (viii) proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $51,185,000.

Net cash provided by financing activities of $7,677,000 was primarily comprised of (i) proceeds from borrowings of $1,721,974,000 and (ii) proceeds received from exercises of employee stock options of $29,377,000, partially offset by, (iii) repayments of borrowings of $993,665,000, (iv) dividends paid on common shares of $561,981,000, (v) distributions to minority partners of $85,419,000 and (vi) dividends paid on preferred shares of $57,112,000.

Capital Expenditures

Our capital expenditures consist of expenditures to maintain assets, tenant improvements and leasing commissions.  Recurring capital improvements include expenditures to maintain a property’s competitive position within the market and tenant improvements and leasing commissions necessary to re-lease expiring leases or renew or extend existing leases.  Non-recurring capital improvements include expenditures completed in the year of acquisition and the following two years that were planned at the time of acquisition as well as tenant improvements and leasing commissions for space that was vacant at the time of acquisition of a property.  Our development and redevelopment expenditures include all hard and soft costs associated with the development or redevelopment of a property, including tenant improvements, leasing commissions and capitalized interest and operating costs until the property is substantially
complete and ready for its intended use.

Funds From Operations (“FFO”)

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs. FFO and FFO per diluted share should be evaluated along with GAAP net income and income per diluted share (the most directly comparable GAAP
measures), as well as cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating performance of equity REITs. Management believes that FFO and FFO per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, these non-GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in Our Statements of Cash Flows. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to
net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.  The calculations of both the numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note 17. Income per Share, in our notes to consolidated financial statements on page 171 of this annual report on Form 10-K.

FFO applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions was $844,568,000, or $5.16 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $966,638,000 or $5.89 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2007. FFO applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions was a negative $77,989,000 or $0.50 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2008 compared to $193,412,000, or $1.18 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2007.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We have exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest rates on our consolidated and non-consolidated debt (all of which arises out of non-trading activity) is as follows:

We may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. As of December 31, 2008, variable rate debt with an aggregate principal amount of $462,000,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.75% was subject to LIBOR caps.  These caps are based on a notional amount of $462,000,000 and cap LIBOR at a weighted average rate of 5.93%.

As of December 31, 2008, we have investments in mezzanine loans with an aggregate carrying amount of $99,011,000 that are based on variable interest rates which partially mitigate our exposure to a change in interest rates on our variable rate debt.

Fair Value of Our Debt

The estimated fair value of our debt at December 31, 2008 was less than its aggregate carrying amount by approximately $1,177,806,000 based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at the current rate at which we believe similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt.

Derivative Instruments

We have, and may in the future enter into, derivative positions that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Because these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from their mark-to-market at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in “interest and other investment income” on our consolidated statements of income. In addition, we are, and may in the future be, subject to additional expense based on the notional amount of the derivative positions and a specified spread over LIBOR. Because the market value of these instruments can vary significantly between periods, we may experience significant fluctuations in the amount of our investment income or expense. In 2008, we recognized a net loss of $33,740,000 and in 2007 and 2006 we recognized net gains aggregating approximately $113,503,000
and $153,208,000, respectively, from these positions.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board of Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vornado Realty Trust (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index in Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Vornado Realty Trust at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, effective December 31, 2008, the Company retrospectively adopted the measurement provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-98,

Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vornado Realty Trust and its majority-owned subsidiary, Vornado Realty L.P. All significant inter-company amounts have been eliminated. We account for unconsolidated partially owned entities on the equity method of accounting.  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Significant Accounting Policies

Real Estate:

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly related to the acquisition, improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete. If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the undepreciated net book value of the property carried forward, exceeds the estimated fair value of redeveloped property, the excess is charged to expense.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the assets’ estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40 years. Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximate the useful lives of the assets. Additions to real estate include interest expense capitalized during construction of $63,063,000 and $53,648,000, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, and identified intangibles such as above and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases and customer relationships) and acquired liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) 141,

Business Combinations

and SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that
may affect the property.

Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over our anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis.  An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.  Our impairment analysis is based on our plans for the asset and the market information available to our management at the time the analysis is prepared.  If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, our anticipated holding period for properties, or the estimated fair value of properties change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and
such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.    The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.  Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.  In the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized an aggregate of $78,069,000 of non-cash impairment charges on our wholly owned real estate assets related to certain development projects.  No impairment charges were recognized in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Partially Owned Entities:

In determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we will absorb the majority of the entity’s expected losses, if they occur, or receive the majority of the expected residual returns, if they occur, or both. We have concluded that we do not control a partially owned entity, despite an ownership interest of 50% or greater, if the entity is not considered a variable interest entity and the approval of all of the partners/members is
contractually required with respect to major decisions, such as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange or other disposition of real property, the hiring of a chief executive officer, the commencement, compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or arbitration or the placement of new or additional financing secured by assets of the venture. This is the case with respect to our 50% interests in Monmouth Mall, MartParc Wells, MartParc Orleans, 478-486 Broadway, 968 Third Avenue, West 57

th

Street properties and 825 Seventh Avenue. We account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of investees’ net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions made during the year. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity
method accounting are accounted for on the cost method.

Our investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary.  In the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized $203,919,000 of non-cash impairment charges related to investments in partially owned entities, of which $107,882,000 represents our investment in Lexington Realty Trust and the remainder represents our share of certain ventures’ development costs.  No impairment charges were recognized in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Identified Intangibles:

We record acquired intangible assets (including above-market leases, customer relationships and in-place leases) and acquired intangible liabilities (including below–market leases) at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. We amortize identified intangible assets and liabilities that are determined to have finite lives over the period the assets and liabilities are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets, a component of “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets, were $525,950,000 and $563,359,000, respectively. In addition, the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of “deferred credit” on our consolidated balance sheets, were $719,822,000 and $814,098,000, respectively.

Mezzanine Loans Receivable:

We invest in mezzanine loans to entities which have significant real estate assets.  These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate.  We record these investments at the stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium. We accrete or amortize any discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan receivable utilizing the effective interest method, or straight-line method if the result is not materially different. We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans, if circumstances warrant, to determine whether they are impaired. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable
to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the estimated fair value of the loan or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  In the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized a $57,000,000 non-cash impairment charge on one of our mezzanine loans.  Upon sale of a sub-participation in that loan during 2008, we reversed $10,300,000 of the charge recognized in 2007.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents do not include cash escrowed under loan agreements and cash restricted in connection with an officer’s deferred compensation payable.  The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks which may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit.  We have not experienced any losses to date on our invested cash.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:

We periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents. This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates.  As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $32,834,000 and $19,151,000, respectively, in allowances for doubtful accounts.  In addition, as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $5,773,000 and $3,076,000, respectively, in allowances for receivables
arising from the straight-lining of rents.

Marketable Securities:

We classify debt and equity securities which we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time as securities available-for-sale; equity securities we intend to buy and sell on a short term basis as trading securities; and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock investments which we intend to hold to maturity as securities held–to–maturity. Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale are included as a component of shareholders’ equity and other comprehensive income. Realized gains or losses on the sale of securities are recorded based on the weighted average cost of such securities.

We
    evaluate our portfolio of marketable securities for impairment
    as of each reporting period. For each of the securities in
    our portfolio with unrealized losses, we review the underlying
    cause of the decline in value and the estimated recovery
    period, as well as the severity and duration of the decline.
    In our evaluation, we consider our ability and intent to
    hold these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient
    for us to recover our cost basis. We also evaluate the near-term
    prospects for each of these investments in relation to the
    severity and duration of the decline. In the year ended December
    31, 2008, we recognized an aggregate of $76,352,000 of non-cash
    impairment charges related to investments in marketable securities,
    which is included as a component of “interest and other
    investment (loss) income, net” on our Consolidated Statement
    of Income




 Our conclusions were based on the severity and duration of the
    decline in the market value (“fair value” pursuant
    to SFAS 157) of these  securities and our inability to forecast
    a recovery in the near term. No impairment charges were recognized
    in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, our marketable equity securities
    had an aggregate carrying amount of $120,499,000 and $215,134,000,
    and an aggregate fair value of $118,438,000 and $226,682,000,
    respectively. Accordingly, net unrealized (losses) gains
    were ($2,061,000) and $11,548,000 as of December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, our
    held-to-maturity securities had an aggregate carrying amount
    of $215,884,000 and $96,310,000, and an aggregate fair value
of $164,728,000 and $96,310,000, respectively.

Deferred Charges:

Direct financing costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements as a component of interest expense. Direct costs related to successful leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases. All other deferred charges are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, in accordance with the terms of the agreements to which they relate.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

We have estimated the fair value of all financial instruments reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at amounts which are based upon an interpretation of available market information and valuation methodologies (including discounted cash flow analyses with regard to mezzanine loans and debt).  While we chose not to elect the fair value option prescribed by Statement No.159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities

(“SFAS 159”), for our financial assets and liabilities that had not been previously measured at fair value, the aggregate fair value of our mezzanine loans receivable was less than its aggregate carrying amount by approximately $55,452,000 as of December 31, 2008 and approximated its carrying amount at December 31, 2007.
As of December 31, 2008, the estimated fair value of our consolidated debt was less than its carrying amount by approximately $1,177,806,000.  As of December 31, 2007, the carrying amount of our consolidated debt exceeded its fair value by approximately $49,768,000.  Such fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized upon disposition of our financial instruments.

Revenue Recognition:

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:

•

Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.  We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use.  In addition, in circumstances in which we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

•

Percentage Rent — income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold. These rents are recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104:

Revenue Recognition

, which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., sales thresholds have been achieved).

•

Hotel Revenue — income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue is recognized when the services have been rendered.

•

Trade Shows Revenue — income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred.

•

Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.

•

Management, Leasing and Other Fees – income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities:

SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(“SFAS 133”), as amended and interpreted, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. As required by SFAS 133, we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings. We assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction. For derivatives not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.

Income Taxes:

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to shareholders 100% of taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2008 were characterized, for Federal income tax purposes, as 70.81% ordinary income and 29.19% return of capital. Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2007 were characterized, for Federal income tax purposes, as 61.6% ordinary income and 38.4%
long-term capital gain income. Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2006 were characterized, for Federal income tax purposes, as 29.0% ordinary income, 14.8% long-term capital gain income and 56.2% return of capital.

We have elected to treat certain consolidated subsidiaries, and may in the future elect to treat newly formed subsidiaries, as taxable REIT subsidiaries pursuant to an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code that became effective January 1, 2001.  Taxable REIT subsidiaries may participate in non-real estate related activities and/or perform non-customary services for tenants and are subject to Federal and State income tax at regular corporate tax rates. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries had a combined current income tax liability of approximately $21,357,000 and $15,361,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and have immaterial differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities.

In connection with purchase accounting for H Street, in July 2005 and April 2007 we recorded an aggregate of $222,174,000 of deferred tax liabilities representing the differences between the tax basis and the book basis of the acquired assets and liabilities multiplied by the effective tax rate.  We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of January 16, 2008, we had completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008.  Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, we reversed the deferred tax liabilities and recognized an income tax benefit of $222,174,000 in our consolidated statement of income.

Income Per Share:

Basic income per share is computed based on weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted income per share considers the effect of all potentially dilutive share equivalents, including outstanding employee stock options, restricted shares, warrants and convertible or redeemable securities.

Stock-Based Compensation:

Stock-based compensation consists of awards to certain employees and officers and consists of stock options, restricted stock, restricted Operating Partnership units and out-performance plan awards.  The terms of each of these awards are described in Note 11. Stock-Based Compensation.  We account for all stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123R”).

Stock option

awards

We determine the value of stock option awards, using a binomial valuation model and appropriate market assumptions adjusted to include an estimated forfeiture factor which is based on our past history.  Compensation expense for stock option awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally five years.

Restricted stock and Operating Partnership unit

awards

Restricted stock awards are valued using the average of the high and low market price of our common shares on the NYSE on the date of grant, adjusted to include an estimated forfeiture factor which is based on our past history.   Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally three to five years.  Dividends paid on unvested shares are charged to retained earnings.  Dividends on shares that are cancelled or terminated prior to vesting are charged to compensation expense in the period they are cancelled or terminated.

Restricted Operating Partnership unit awards are also valued using the average of the high and low market price of our common shares on the NYSE on the date of grant, adjusted to include an estimated forfeiture factor which is based on history.  Compensation expense is recognized over the five year vesting period using a graded vesting attribution model as these awards are subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition.  Dividends paid on unvested units are charged to minority interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations.  Dividends on units that are cancelled or terminated prior to the satisfaction of the performance condition and vesting are charged to compensation expense in the period they are cancelled or terminated.

Out-performance plan

awards

Out-performance plan awards are valued using a risk-free valuation model and appropriate market assumptions as of the date of grant, adjusted to include an estimated forfeiture factor which is based on our past history.   Compensation expense is recognized over five years using a graded vesting attribution model as these awards are subject to the satisfaction of certain market and performance conditions, in addition to vesting.

Recently Issued Accounting Literature

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”).

SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 was effective for our financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008.  The FASB has deferred the implementation of the provisions of SFAS 157 relating to certain non-financial assets and liabilities until January 1, 2009. This standard did not materially affect how we determine fair value, but resulted in certain additional disclosures.  SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes
observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels: Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities; Level 2 – observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3 – unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in our consolidated financial statements primarily consist of (i) marketable securities, (ii) the assets of our deferred compensation plan (primarily
marketable securities and equity investments in limited partnerships), for which there is a corresponding liability on our consolidated balance sheets and (iii) Class A units of the Operating Partnership, held by third-parties.  Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2008 are presented in the table below based on their level in the fair value hierarchy.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, which permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.  SFAS 159 was effective on January 1, 2008.  We did not elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial instruments on the effective date and have not determined whether we will elect this option for any eligible financial instruments we acquire in the future.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141R,

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141R”).  SFAS 141R broadens the guidance of SFAS 141, extending its applicability to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses.  SFAS 141R also broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and interests transferred as a result of business combinations; and acquisition related costs will generally be expensed rather than included as part of the basis of the acquisition.  SFAS 141R expands required disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for all transactions entered into on or after January 1, 2009.  The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 could
materially impact future financial results to the extent that we acquire significant amounts of real estate, in part because acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred compared to our current practice of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life of the assets acquired.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No.
 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
 Financial Statements - An Amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS
 160”).  SFAS 160 requires a noncontrolling interest in
 a subsidiary to be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated
 net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest
 to be identified in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS
 160 also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes
 in the parent’s ownership interest and requires fair value
 measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained
 in a deconsolidation. As of December 31, 2008, as part of our
 preparation for the adoption of SFAS 160, which is effective
 for us on January 1, 2009, we have retroactively adopted the
 measurement provisions of EITF Topic D-98,

Classification
  and Measurement of Redeemable Securities

.
  Upon adoption, we adjusted the carrying amounts of the Class
  A units held by third parties, a component of “minority
  interest” on
  our consolidated balance sheets, by recognizing a $639,447,000
  increase to the January 1, 2006 balance of “minority interest” and
  a corresponding decrease in the January 1, 2006 balance of “earnings
in excess of (less than) distributions” which was accounted
for as a cumulative effect  adjustment on January 1, 2006.
Subsequent adjustments to the carrying amounts of the Class A
 units, to reflect the change in their redemption value at the
end of each reporting period, were recorded to “additional
capital.”   The
adoption of SFAS 160 on January 1, 2009, will not result in the
re-classification of the Class A units held by third parties
to a component within “shareholders’ equity.”

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities – an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133

(“SFAS 161”)

.

SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities, including disclosures regarding how an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133

,

and the impact of derivative instruments and related hedged items on an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows.  SFAS 161 is effective on January 1, 2009.  We believe that the adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. APB 14-1,

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that may be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)

, (the “FSP”), which is effective for us on January 1, 2009 and requires retroactive application.  The adoption of this FSP will affect the accounting for our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures and Series D-13 convertible preferred units.  The FSP requires the initial proceeds from the sale of our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures and Series D-13 convertible preferred units to be allocated between a liability component and an equity component.  The resulting discount will be amortized using the effective interest method over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding as additional interest expense.  The adoption of the
FSP on January 1, 2009 will result in the recognition of an aggregate unamortized debt discount of $139,937,000 (as of December 31, 2008) in our consolidated balance sheets and additional interest expense in our consolidated statements of income.  Our current estimate of the incremental interest expense, net of minority interest, for each reporting period is as follows:

In May 2008, the FASB issued  Statement No. 163,

Accounting for Financial Guarantee Insurance Contracts

(“SFAS 163”).  SFAS 163 was issued to decrease inconsistencies within Statement No. 60,

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises

, and clarify how it applies to financial guarantee insurance contracts issued by insurance enterprises, including the recognition of premium revenue and claim liabilities.  SFAS 163 also requires expanded disclosures about financial guarantee insurance contracts.  SFAS 163 is effective on January 1, 2009.  We believe that the adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock (“EITF 07-5”). Paragraph 11(a) of SFAS 133 specifies that a contract that would otherwise meet the definition of a derivative but is both (a) indexed to the Company’s own stock and (b) classified in stockholders’ equity in the statement of financial position would not be considered a derivative financial instrument. EITF 07-5 provides a new two-step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer’s own stock and thus able to qualify for the SFAS 133 paragraph 11(a) scope exception. EITF 07-5 is effective on January 1, 2009.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.

There were no material real estate acquisitions or investments during 2008.  We completed approximately $4,045,400,000 of real estate acquisitions and investments in 2007.  We record the assets (primarily land, building, in-place and above market leases) and liabilities (primarily mortgage debt and below market leases) acquired in real estate acquisitions at their estimated fair values.  Below are the details of our 2007 acquisitions.

Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign
companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties.  The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump.

In July 2005, we acquired H Street, which owns a 50% interest in real estate assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia and Washington, DC.

for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Other:

India Real Estate Ventures

In August 2008, we entered into a joint venture with Reliance Industries Limited (“Reliance”) (BSE: RIL), under which each partner has an equal ownership interest, to acquire, develop, and operate retail shopping centers across key cities in India.  We are also a partner in four other joint ventures established to develop real estate in India’s major cities. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we funded an aggregate of $50,387,000 in cash to our India ventures, including $7,500,000 to the Reliance venture and $34,077,000 to the India Property Fund L.P. (“IPF”).  As of December 31, 2008, our aggregate investment in all of these ventures was $89,295,000 and our remaining capital commitment is approximately $192,000,000.  At December 31, 2008 and 2007, our ownership interest in IPF was 36.5% and 50.6%, respectively.  Based on the reduction of our ownership
interest in 2008, we no longer consolidate the accounts of IPF into our consolidated financial statements and beginning on January 1, 2008 we account for IPF under the equity method.

Filene’s, Boston, Massachusetts

On January 26, 2007, a joint venture in which we have a 50% interest, acquired the Filene’s property located in the Downtown Crossing district of Boston, Massachusetts for approximately $100,000,000 in cash, of which our share was $50,000,000.  We account for our investment in the joint venture on the equity method.

Derivative Instruments and Related Marketable Securities

Investment in McDonald’s Corporation (“McDonalds”) (NYSE: MCD)

We owned an economic interest in 14,565,500 McDonalds’ common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which we purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on McDonalds’ common shares. These call and put options had an initial weighted-average strike price of $32.66 per share, or an aggregate of $475,692,000 and provided for net cash settlement. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increased at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and was decreased for dividends received. The options provided us with the same economic gain or loss as if we had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate purchase price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options were derivatives and did not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period were recognized as “interest and other investment income, net” on our consolidated statements of income.  During 2006, we sold 2,119,500 of these shares at a weighted average price of $35.49 per share, and acquired an additional 1,250,000 option shares at a weighted average price of $33.08 per share.  During 2007, we settled the 13,695,500 remaining option shares and received an aggregate of $260,719,000 in cash.  We recognized net gains of $108,821,000 and $138,815,000 in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing income from the mark-to-market of these shares during the period of our ownership through their settlement, net of related LIBOR charges.

In addition to the above, in October 2007, we sold 858,000 McDonald’s common shares for aggregate proceeds of $48,434,000, or $56.45 per share, and recognized a net gain of $23,090,000, representing accumulated appreciation during the period of our ownership. The shares were acquired in 2005 at a weighted average price of $29.54 per share, and were classified as “available-for-sale” marketable equity securities on our consolidated balance sheet.

The aggregate net gain from inception of our investments in McDonalds in 2005 through final settlement in October 2007 was $289,414,000.

Investment in Sears, Roebuck and Co. (“Sears”)

We owned an economic interest in 7,916,900 Sears’ common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which we purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on Sears’ common shares. These call and put options had an initial weighted-average strike price of $39.82 per share, or an aggregate of $315,250,000. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increased at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and was decreased for dividends received. The options provided us with the same economic gain or loss as if we had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options were derivatives and did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses
resulting from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period were recognized as “interest and other investment income, net” on our consolidated statements of income.  On March 30, 2005, as a result of the merger between Sears and Kmart and pursuant to the terms of the contract, our derivative position representing 7,916,900 Sears common shares became a derivative position representing 2,491,819 common shares of Sears Holdings, Inc. (“Sears Holdings”) (Nasdaq: SHLD) valued at $323,936,000 based on the then closing share price of $130.00 and $146,663,000 of cash. During 2005 we sold 402,660 of the option shares at a weighted average price of $124.44 per share. During 2006, we settled the remaining 2,089,159 option shares at a weighted average price of $125.43 per share, resulting in a net gain of $18,611,000.  The aggregate net gain realized from inception of this investment in 2004 through settlement was $142,877,000.

Investment in Sears Canada, Inc. (“Sears Canada”)

On April 3, 2006, we tendered the 7,500,000 Sears Canada shares we owned to Sears Holdings at the increased tender price of Cdn. $18.00 per share (the equivalent at that time of US $15.68 per share), which resulted in a net gain of $55,438,000, the difference between the tender price, and our carrying amount of $8.29 per share.  Together with income recognized in the fourth quarter of 2005 that resulted from a Sears Canada special dividend, the aggregate net gain from inception in 2005 on our $143,737,000 investment was $78,323,000.

GMH Communities L.P. Stock Purchase Warrants

We owned warrants to acquire GMH Communities L.P. (“GMH”) common equity.  The warrants entitled us to acquire (i) 6,666,667 GMH limited partnership units at an exercise price of $7.50 per unit and (ii) 5,496,724 GMH limited partnership units at an exercise price of $8.22 per unit.  The warrants were accounted for as derivative instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  Accordingly, the gains or losses resulting form the mark-to-market of the warrants at the end of each reporting period were recognized as “interest and other investment income, net” on our consolidated statements of income.

On November 3, 2004, we exercised our first tranche of warrants to acquire 6,666,667 limited partnership units at a price of $7.50 per unit, or an aggregate of $50,000,000.  On May 2, 2006, the date our remaining GMH warrants were to expire, we received 1,817,247 GMH Communities Trust (NYSE: GCT) (“GCT”) common shares through an automatic cashless exercise, which resulted in the recognition of a net loss of $16,370,000, the difference between the value of the GCT common shares received on May 2, 2006 and GCT’s closing share price of $15.51 on December 31,2005.

Investments in Partially Owned Entities

Toys “R” Us (“Toys”)

As of December 31, 2008, we own 32.7% of Toys.  The business of Toys is highly seasonal.  Historically, Toys’ fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income.  Because Toys’ fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, we record our 32.7% share of Toys’ net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis.

In July 2008, in connection with an audit of Toys’ purchase accounting basis financial statements for its fiscal years 2006 and 2007, it was determined that the purchase accounting basis income tax expense was understated.  Our share of this non-cash charge was $14,900,000, which we recognized as part of our equity in Toys’ net loss in the second quarter of 2008.  This non-cash charge had no effect on cash actually paid for income taxes or Toys’ previously issued Recap basis consolidated financial statements.

In 2006, Toys closed 87 Toys “R” Us stores in the United States as a result of its store-closing program.  Toys incurred restructuring and other charges aggregating approximately $127,000,000 before tax, which includes $44,000,000 for the cost of liquidating the inventory. Our share of the $127,000,000 charge was $42,000,000, of which $27,300,000 had no income statement effect as a result of purchase accounting and the remaining portion relating to the cost of liquidating inventory of approximately $9,100,000 after-tax, was recognized as an expense as part of our equity in Toys’ net income in 2006.

We owned 32.5% and 32.8% of the outstanding common shares of Alexander’s at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  We manage, lease and develop Alexander’s properties pursuant to the agreements described below which expire in March of each year and are automatically renewable.  At December 31, 2008 the fair value of our investment in Alexander’s, based on Alexander’s December 31, 2008 closing share price of $254.90, was $421,622,000.

Lexington Realty Trust (“Lexington”) (NYSE: LXP)

On December 31, 2006, Newkirk Realty Trust (NYSE: NKT) was acquired in a merger by Lexington, a real estate investment trust that invests in, owns and manages commercial properties net leased to major corporations throughout the United States.  We owned 10,186,991 Newkirk Master Limited Partnership (“Newkirk MLP”) units (representing a 15.8% ownership interest), which was also acquired by Lexington as a subsidiary and was renamed Lexington Master Limited Partnership (“Lexington MLP”).  The units in Newkirk MLP, which we accounted for on the equity method, were converted on a 0.80 for 1 basis into limited partnership units of Lexington MLP, which we also account for on the equity method.  In addition, upon the merger, Newkirk terminated its advisory agreement with NKT Advisors, in which we had a 20.0% interest, for an aggregate payment of $12,500,000, of which our
share was $2,300,000.  On December 31, 2006, we recognized a net gain of $10,362,000, as a result of the merger transactions, which is included on a component of “(loss) income from partially owned entities” on our consolidated statement of income.

In connection with the above transactions, we owned 8,149,592 limited partnership units of Lexington MLP which were exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into Lexington common shares, or a 7.7% limited partnership interest.  On October 28, 2008, we acquired 8,000,000 Lexington common shares for $5.60 per share, or $44,800,000.  The purchase price consisted of $22,400,000 in cash and a $22,400,000 margin loan recourse only to the 8,000,000 shares acquired.  In addition, we exchanged our existing limited partnership units in Lexington MLP for 8,149,592 Lexington common shares.  As of December 31, 2008, we own 16,149,592 Lexington common shares, or approximately 17.2% of Lexington’s common equity.  We account for our investment in Lexington on the equity method and record our pro rata share of Lexington’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because we file our consolidated
financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that Lexington files its financial statements.

Based on Lexington’s December 31, 2008 closing share price of $5.00, the market value (“fair value” pursuant to SFAS 157) of our investment in Lexington was $80,748,000, or $100,707,000 below the carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet. We have concluded that our investment in Lexington is “other-than-temporarily” impaired and recorded a $100,707,000 non-cash impairment loss in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Together with impairment changes recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2008, we recognized an aggregate of $107,882,000 of non-cash charges on our investment in Lexington.  Our conclusions were based on the recent deterioration in the capital and financial markets and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near-term.  These charges are included as a component of “(loss) income from partially owned entities,” on our
consolidated statement of income.

GMH

In June 2008, pursuant to the sale of GMH’s military housing division and the merger of its student housing division with American Campus Communities, Inc. (“ACC”) (NYSE: ACC), we received an aggregate of $105,180,000, consisting of $82,142,000 in cash and 753,126 shares of ACC common stock valued at $23,038,000 based on ACC’s then closing share price of $30.59, in exchange for our entire interest in GMH.  We subsequently sold all of the ACC common shares.  The above transactions resulted in a net gain of $2,038,000 which is included as a component of “net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate” in our consolidated statement of income.  The aggregate net income realized from inception of this investment in 2004 through its disposition was $77,000,000.

Real Estate Joint Ventures’ Development Costs

During 2008, we recognized non-cash charges aggregating $96,037,000, for the write-off of our share of certain partially owned entities’ development costs, as these projects were either deferred or abandoned.  These charges include $37,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2008, for our 50% share of costs in connection with the redevelopment of the Filene’s property in Boston, Massachusetts and $23,000,000 in the first quarter of 2008, for our 50% share of costs in connection with the abandonment of the “arena move”/Moynihan East portions of the Farley project. Such charges are included as a component of “(loss) income from partially owned entities,” on our consolidated statement of income.

As of November 13, 2008, our joint venture partner’s failure to contribute its pro rata share of required capital resulted in our ability under the joint venture agreement to assert unilateral control over major business decisions and accordingly, we began to consolidate our investment pursuant to ARB 51.

(4)

Includes $4,100 for the reversal of a non-cash charge recorded by the joint venture in prior periods which, pursuant to paragraph 19(n) of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 18,

The Equity Method of Accounting For Investments In Common Stock,

should have been eliminated in the determination of our share of the earnings of the venture.  In addition, in accordance with EITF 99-10, during the quarter ended September 30, 2008 our partner’s capital account was reduced to zero and, accordingly, we recognized $1,528 of additional net loss for the portion that related to our partner’s pro rata share of the venture’s net loss.

(5)

Represents our 50% share of equity in net income from January 1, 2007 through April 29, 2007.

On February 10, 2006, we acquired a 50% interest in a $115,000 note issued by Related Equinox Holdings II, LLC (the “Note”), for $57,500 in cash. The Note is secured by a pledge of the stock of Related Equinox Holdings II. Related Equinox Holdings II owns Equinox Holdings Inc., which in turn owns all of the assets and obligations, including the fitness clubs, operated under the Equinox brand. The Note is junior to a $50,000 revolving loan and $280,000 of senior unsecured obligations. The Note is senior to $125,000 of equity contributed by third parties for their acquisition of the Equinox fitness club business. The Note matures on February 15, 2013 and bears paid-in-kind interest at 14% through February 15, 2011, increasing by 3% per annum through maturity. The Note is prepayable at any time after February 15, 2009

On June 16, 2006, we acquired an 81.5% interest in a $95,968 mezzanine loan to Tharaldson Lodging Companies for $78,166 in cash. The loan is secured by a 107 hotel property portfolio with brands including Fairfield Inn, Residence Inn, Comfort Inn and Courtyard by Marriott. The loan is subordinate to $671,778 of debt and is senior to approximately $192,000 of other debt and equity. The loan matures in April 2009, with two one-year extensions, provides for a 0.75% placement fee and bears interest at LIBOR plus 4.25% (4.68% at December 31, 2008)

.

(3)

In 2005, we made a $135,000 loan to Riley HoldCo Corp., consisting of a $60,000 mezzanine loan and a $75,000 fixed rate unsecured loan. During 2006, we were repaid the $60,000 balance of the mezzanine loan with a pre-payment premium of $972, which was recognized as “interest and other investment income” for the year ended December 31, 2006

.

(4)

On June 30, 2006, we made a $73,750 mezzanine loan secured by the equity interests in 280 Park Avenue, a 1.2 million square foot office building, located between 48th and 49th Streets in Manhattan. The loan bears interest at 10.25% and matures in June 2016. The loan is subordinate to $1.036 billion of other debt and is senior to approximately $260,000 of equity and interest reserves

.

(5)

On June 5, 2007, we acquired a 42% interest in two MPH mezzanine loans totaling $158,700 for $66,000 in cash.  The loans, which were due on February 8, 2008 and have not been repaid, are subordinate to $2.9 billion of mortgage and other debt and secured by the equity interests in four New York City properties: Worldwide Plaza, 1540 Broadway office condominium, 527 Madison Avenue and Tower 56.  At December 31, 2007, we reduced the net carrying amount of the loans to $9,000 by recognizing a $57,000 non-cash charge in our consolidated statement of income.  On April 2, 2008, we sold a sub-participation interest in the loans for $19,300 which resulted in the reduction of our valuation allowance from $57,000 to $46,700 and the recognition of $10,300 of non-cash income in our consolidated statement of income.

Represents the extended maturity for certain loans in which we have the unilateral right, ability and intent to extend.  In the case of our convertible and exchangeable debt, represents the earliest date holders may require us to repurchase the debentures.

(2)

On March 12, 2008, we completed a $260,000 refinancing of the River House Apartment Complex.  The financing is comprised of a $196,000 interest-only seven-year 5.43% fixed rate mortgage and a $64,000 interest-only ten-year floating rate mortgage at the Freddie Mac Reference Note Rate plus 1.53% (1.78% at December 31, 2008).  We retained net proceeds of $205,000 after repaying the existing loan.

(3)

On February 11, 2008, we completed a $335,000 refinancing of the Green Acres regional mall.  This interest-only loan has a rate of LIBOR plus 1.40% (3.28% at December 31, 2008) and matures in February 2011, with two one-year extension options.  We retained net proceeds of $193,000 after repaying the existing loan.

On March 21, 2007, Vornado Realty Trust sold $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.85% convertible senior debentures due 2027, pursuant to an effective registration statement.  The aggregate net proceeds from this offering, after underwriters’ discounts and expenses, were approximately $1.37 billion.  The debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in 2012 for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures in 2012, 2017, and 2022 and in certain other limited circumstances.  The debentures are convertible, under certain circumstances, for cash and Vornado common shares at an initial conversion rate of 6.1553 common shares per one-thousand dollars of principal amount of debentures.  The initial conversion price of $162.46 represented a premium of 30%
over the March 21, 2007 closing price for our common shares. The principal amount of debentures will be settled for cash and the amount in excess of the principal defined as the conversion value will be settled in cash or, at our election, Vornado common shares.  The net proceeds of the offering were contributed to the Operating Partnership in the form of an inter-company loan and the Operating Partnership fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of the debentures.  There are no restrictions which limit the Operating Partnership from making distributions to Vornado and Vornado has no independent assets or operations outside of the Operating Partnership.

We are amortizing the underwriters’ discount on a straight-line basis (which approximates the effective interest method) over the period from the date of issuance to the date of earliest redemption of April 1, 2012.  Because the conversion option associated with the debentures, when analyzed as a freestanding instrument, meets the criteria to be classified as equity specified by paragraphs 12 to 32 of EITF 00-19

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s own Common Stock,”

separate accounting for the conversion option under SFAS No. 133

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”

is not appropriate.

In November 2008, we purchased $17,300 (aggregate face amounts) of our convertible senior debentures due 2027 for $11,094 in cash.

(12)

On November 20, 2006, we sold $1,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.625% convertible senior debentures due 2026, pursuant to an effective registration statement.  The aggregate net proceeds from this offering, after underwriters’ discounts and expenses, were approximately $980,000.  The debentures are convertible, under certain circumstances, for Vornado common shares at a current conversion rate of 6.5168 common shares per $1 of principal amount of debentures. The initial conversion price of $153.45 represented a premium of 30% over the November 14, 2006 closing price for our common shares.  The debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in 2011 for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures in 2011, 2016, and 2021 and in the event of a change in
control.  The net proceeds of the offering were contributed to the Operating Partnership in the form of an inter-company loan and the Operating Partnership fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of the debentures.  There are no restrictions which limit the Operating Partnership from making distributions to Vornado and Vornado has no independent assets or operations outside of the Operating Partnership.

We are amortizing the underwriters’ discount on a straight-line basis (which approximates the effective interest method) over the period from the date of issuance to the date of earliest redemption of December 1, 2011.  Because the conversion option associated with the debentures, when analyzed as a freestanding instrument, meets the criteria to be classified as equity specified by paragraphs 12 to 32 of EITF 00-19

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s own Common Stock,”

separate accounting for the conversion option under SFAS No. 133

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”

is not appropriate.

In November 2008, we purchased $10,200 (aggregate face amounts) of our convertible senior debentures due 2026 for $6,987 in cash.

(13)

During 2008, we purchased $81,540 (aggregate face amounts) of our senior unsecured notes due August 15, 2009 for $80,408.

(14)

Lehman Brothers is part of the syndicate of banks under this unsecured revolving credit facility with a total commitment of $35 million.  On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  All of the banks in the syndicate, except for Lehman Brothers, have funded their pro rata share of a draw we made subsequent to Lehman’s bankruptcy filing.

Debt - continued

Our revolving credit facility and senior unsecured notes contain financial covenants which require us to maintain minimum interest coverage ratios and limit our debt to market capitalization ratios. We believe that we have complied with all of our financial covenants as of December 31, 2008.

On May 9, 2006, we executed supplemental indentures with respect to our senior unsecured notes due 2007, 2009 and 2010 (collectively, the “Notes”), pursuant to our consent solicitation statement dated April 18, 2006, as amended. Holders of approximately 96.7% of the aggregate face amount of the Notes consented to the solicitation. The supplemental indentures contain modifications of certain covenants and related defined terms governing the terms of the Notes to make them consistent with corresponding provisions of the covenants and defined terms included in the senior unsecured notes due 2011 issued on February 16, 2006. The supplemental indentures also include a new covenant that provides for an increase in the interest rate of the Notes upon certain decreases in the ratings assigned by rating agencies to the Notes. In connection with the consent solicitation we paid an
aggregate fee of $2,241,000 to the consenting note holders, which will be amortized into expense over the remaining term of the Notes. In addition, we incurred advisory and professional fees aggregating $1,415,000, which were expensed in 2006.

The net carrying amount of properties collateralizing the notes and mortgages payable amounted to $11.631 billion at December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, the principal repayments required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows:

Stock-based Compensation

Our Share Option Plan (the “Plan”) provides for grants of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and performance shares to certain employees and officers.  We have approximately 2,400,000 shares available for future grant under the Plan at December 31, 2008.

In March 2006, our Board of Trustees (the “Board”) approved an amendment to the Plan to permit the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”) to grant awards in the form of limited partnership units (“OP Units”) of the Operating Partnership. OP Units can be granted either as free-standing awards or in tandem with other awards under the Plan. OP Units may be converted into the Operating Partnership’s Class A common units and, consequently, become convertible by the holder on a one-for-one basis for our common shares or the cash value of such shares at our election.

We account for all stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123R:  Stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 consists of stock option awards, restricted stock and Operating Partnership unit awards and out-performance plan awards.

2006 Out-Performance Plan

In March 2006, the Board approved the terms of the Vornado Realty Trust 2006 Out-Performance Plan (the “2006 OPP”), a long-term “pay-for-performance” incentive compensation program. The purpose of the 2006 OPP was to further align the interests of our shareholders and management by encouraging our senior officers and employees to create shareholder value.  On April 25, 2006, our Compensation Committee approved 2006 OPP awards to a total of 54 employees and officers of the Company, which aggregated 91% of the total 2006 OPP.  The fair value of the awards on the date of grant, as adjusted for estimated forfeitures, was approximately $46,141,000 and is being amortized into expense over the five-year vesting period beginning on the date of grant, using a graded vesting attribution model.

Under the 2006 OPP, award recipients share in a performance pool when our total return to shareholders exceeds a cumulative 30% (for a period of 30 consecutive days), including both share appreciation and dividends paid, from a price per share of $89.17 (the average closing price per common share for the 30 trading days prior to March 15, 2006). The size of the pool is 10% of the amount in excess of the 30% benchmark, subject to a maximum cap of $100,000,000.  Each award was designated as a specified percentage of the $100,000,000 maximum cap.  Awards were issued in the form of a new class of Operating Partnership units (“OPP Units”) and are subject to achieving the performance threshold, time vesting and other conditions.  OPP Units are convertible by the holder into an equivalent number of the Operating Partnership’s Class A units, which are redeemable by the holder for
Vornado common shares on a one-for-one basis or the cash value of such shares, at our election.  All awards earned vest 33.3% on each of March 15, 2009, 2010 and 2011 subject to continued employment.  Once a performance pool has been established, each OPP Unit will receive a distribution equal to the distribution paid on a Class A unit, including an amount payable in OPP Units representing distributions paid on a Class A unit during the performance period. As of January 12, 2007, the maximum performance threshold under the Out-Performance Plan was achieved, concluding the performance period.

2008 Out-Performance Plan

On March 31, 2008, our Compensation Committee approved a $75,000,000 out-performance plan (the “2008 OPP”) that requires the achievement of performance objectives against both absolute and relative thresholds.  The 2008 OPP establishes a potential performance pool in which 78 members of senior management have the opportunity to share if the total return to our shareholders (the “Total Return”) resulting from both share appreciation and dividends for the four-year period from March 31, 2008 to March 31, 2012 exceeds both an absolute and a relative hurdle.  The initial value from which to determine the Total Return is $86.20 per share, a 0.93% premium to the trailing 10-day average closing price on the New York Stock Exchange for our common shares on the date the plan was adopted.

The size of the out-performance pool for the 2008 OPP is 6% of the aggregate “out-performance return” subject to a maximum total award of $75,000,000 (the “Maximum Award”).  The “out-performance return” is comprised of (i) 3% of the total dollar value of the Total Return in excess of 10% per annum (the “Absolute Component”), plus (ii) 3% of the total dollar value of the Total Return in excess of the Relative Threshold (the “Relative Component”), based on the SNL Equity REIT Index (the “Index”) over the four-year performance period.  In the event that the Relative Component creates a negative award as a result of underperforming the Index, the value of any out-performance award potentially earned under the Absolute Component will be reduced dollar for dollar.  In addition, awards potentially earned under the Relative Component
will be reduced on a ratable sliding scale to the extent the Total Return is less than 10% per annum and to zero to the extent the Total Return is less than 7% per annum.  The size of this out-performance pool, if any, will be determined based on the highest 30-trading day trailing average price of our common shares during the final 150 days of the four-year period.  During the four-year performance period, participants are entitled to receive 10% of the common dividends paid on Vornado’s common shares for each OPP unit awarded, regardless of whether the OPP units are ultimately earned.

The 2008 OPP also provides participants an opportunity to earn partial awards during two interim measurement periods (the “Interim Periods”):  (a) one for a period consisting of the first two years of the performance period and (b) one for a period consisting of the final two years of the performance period.  For each Interim Period, participants may be entitled to share in 40% ($30,000,000) of the maximum $75,000,000 performance pool if the performance thresholds have been met for the applicable Interim Periods on a pro rated basis.  The starting share price for the first Interim Period is $86.20 per share.  The starting share price for the second Interim Period is equal to the greater of our common share price on March 31, 2010, or the initial starting share price of $86.20 per share less dividends paid during the first two years of the plan.  If the maximum award is earned
during the first Interim Period, participants lose the potential to earn the second Interim Period award, but not the potential to earn the remainder of the maximum award over the four-year period.  The size of any out-performance pool for an Interim Period will be determined based on the highest 30-day trailing average price of our shares during the final 120 days of the applicable Interim Period.  Awards earned under the program (including any awards earned for the Interim Periods), will vest 50% on March 31, 2012 and 50% on March 31, 2013.  The fair value of the OPP awards on the date of grant, as adjusted for estimated forfeitures, was approximately $21,600,000, and is being amortized into expense over a five-year period beginning on the date of grant through the final vesting period, using a graded vesting attribution model.

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized $16,021,000, $12,734,000 and $8,293,000 of compensation expense, respectively, in connection with our 2006 and 2008 out-performance plans.  The remaining unrecognized compensation expense of $29,551,000 will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.  Distributions paid on unvested OPP Units are charged to “minority interest expense” on our consolidated statements of income and amounted to $2,918,000, $2,694,000 and $0 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to 100% of the average of the high and low market price of our common shares on the NYSE on the date of grant, generally vest pro-rata over five years and expire 10 years from the date of grant.  In 2008, our senior executives were granted options with an exercise price of 17.5% in excess of the average of the high and low market price of our common shares on the NYSE on the date of the grant.

Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recognized $9,051,000, $4,549,000 and $1,705,000, of compensation expense, respectively, for the portion of stock option awards that vested during each year.

Retirement Plans

Prior
    to December 2008, we had two defined benefit pension plans,
    a Vornado Realty Trust Retirement Plan (“Vornado Plan”)
    and a Merchandise Mart Properties Pension Plan (“Mart
    Plan”). The benefits under the Vornado Plan and the
    Mart Plan (collectively, the “Plans”) were frozen
    in December 1997 and June 1999, respectively. Benefits under
    the Plans are or were primarily based on years of service
    and compensation during employment or on years of credited
    service and established monthly benefits. Funding policy
    for the Plans was based on contributions at the minimum amounts
    required by law. In December 2008, we finalized the termination
    of the Vornado Plan which resulted in a $4,600,000 pension
    settlement expense which is included as a component of “general
    and administrative” expense on our consolidated statement
    of income. In addition, during the first quarter of 2009,
    we expect to finalize the termination of the Mart Plan,
    which will result in the recognition of a $2,800,000 pension
    settlement expense. The financial results of the Mart Plan,
    using a December 31, measurement date, are provided below.

Leases

As lessor:

We lease space to tenants under operating leases. Most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base rentals payable monthly in advance. Office building leases generally require the tenants to reimburse us for operating costs and real estate taxes above their base year costs. Shopping center leases provide for the pass-through to tenants the tenants’ share of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance. Shopping center leases also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ sales. As of December 31, 2008, future base rental revenue under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding rents for leases with an original term of less than one year and rents resulting from the exercise of renewal options, is as follows:

Year Ending December 31:

These amounts do not include rentals based on tenants’ sales. These percentage rents approximated $7,322,000, $9,379,000, and $7,593,000, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Former Bradlees Locations

Pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, dated May 1, 1992, we are due $5,000,000 per annum of additional rent from Stop & Shop which was allocated to certain of Bradlees former locations. On December 31, 2002, prior to the expiration of the leases to which the additional rent was allocated, we reallocated this rent to other former Bradlees leases also guaranteed by Stop & Shop. Stop & Shop is contesting our right to reallocate and claims that we are no longer entitled to the additional rent. At December 31, 2008, we are due an aggregate of $30,400,000. We believe the additional rent provision of the guaranty expires at the earliest in 2012 and we are vigorously contesting Stop & Shop’s position.

We are also a lessee under capital leases for real estate. Lease terms generally range from 5-20 years with renewal or purchase options. Capitalized leases are recorded at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the property. Capitalized leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset or life of the related lease, whichever is shorter. Amortization expense on capital leases is included in “depreciation and amortization” on our consolidated statements of income.

Commitments and Contingencies

Insurance

We carry commercial liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) “acts of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (“TRIPRA”), which expires in December 2014, and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to our assets.  Our New York Office, Washington, DC Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart divisions have $2.0 billion of per occurrence all risk property insurance coverage, including terrorism coverage in effect through September 15, 2009.  Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $150,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, and a $150,000,000 annual aggregate.

In June 2007 we formed Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, to act as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage and as a direct insurer for coverage for “certified” acts of terrorism and for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (“TRIPRA”).  Coverage for “certified” acts of terrorism is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC.  Prior to the formation of PPIC, we were uninsured for losses under NBCR coverage.  Subsequently, we have $2.0 billion of NBCR coverage under TRIPRA, for which PPIC is responsible for 15% of each NBCR loss and the insurance company deductible of $1,000,000.   We are
ultimately responsible for any loss borne by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties (which are generally non-recourse to us), senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance and/or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Contractual Obligations

At December 31, 2008, there were $44,565,000 of outstanding letters of credit under our $0

.

965 billion revolving credit facility.  Our credit facilities contain financial covenants, that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

We are committed to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $213,352,000. Of this amount, $80,923,000 is committed to IPF and is pledged as collateral to IPF’s lender.

From time to time, we have disposed of substantial amounts of real estate to third parties for which, as to certain properties, we remain contingently liable for rent payments or mortgage indebtedness that we cannot quantify.

Commitments and Contingencies – continued

Litigation

We are from time to time involved in various other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including the matters referred to above, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (“USDC-NJ”) claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that a prior order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York dated February 6, 2001, as modified on appeal to the District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 13, 2001, froze our right to reallocate which effectively terminated our right to collect the additional rent from Stop & Shop. On March 3, 2003, after we moved
to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Stop & Shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint. On March 26, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a new complaint in New York Supreme Court, asserting substantially the same claims as in its USDC-NJ complaint. We removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In January 2005 that court remanded the action to the New York Supreme Court. On February 14, 2005, we served an answer in which we asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the
motions for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Court’s decision and on December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Court’s decision.  On January 16, 2007, we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Court’s decision which was denied on March 13, 2007.  We are currently engaged in discovery and anticipate that a trial date will be set for some time in 2009.  We intend to vigorously pursue our claims against Stop & Shop.  In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

On May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas and the 555 California Street complex.  Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties.  The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump.  In August 2005, Mr. Trump brought a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court against, among others, the general partners of the partnerships referred to above.   Mr. Trump’s claims arose out of a dispute over the sale price of and use of proceeds from, the sale of properties located on the former Penn Central rail yards between West 59th and 72nd Streets in Manhattan which were formerly
owned by the partnerships.  In decisions dated September 14, 2005 and July 24, 2006, the Court denied several of Mr. Trump’s motions and ultimately dismissed all of Mr. Trump’s claims, except for his claim seeking access to books and records.  In a decision dated October 1, 2007, the Court determined that Mr. Trump had already received access to the books and records to which he was entitled, with the exception of certain documents which were subsequently delivered to Mr. Trump.  Mr. Trump sought re-argument and renewal on, and filed a notice of appeal in connection with, his dismissed claims.  In a decision dated January 6, 2009, the Court denied all of Mr. Trump’s motions.  Mr. Trump has filed a notice appealing the 2007 and 2009 decisions.  In connection with the acquisition, we agreed to indemnify the sellers for liabilities and expenses arising out of Mr. Trump’s claim that the general partners of the partnerships we acquired did
not sell the rail yards at a fair price or could have sold the rail yards for a greater price and any other claims asserted in the legal action; provided however, that if Mr. Trump prevails on certain claims involving partnership matters, other than claims relating to sale price, the sellers will be required to reimburse us for certain costs related to those claims.  We believe that the claims relating to the sale price are without merit.  All other allegations are not asserted as a basis for damages and regardless of merit, and in our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows

.

In July 2005, we acquired H Street Building Corporation (“H Street”) which has a subsidiary that owns, among other things, a 50% tenancy in common interest in land located in Arlington County, Virginia, known as "Pentagon Row," leased to two tenants.  In April 2007, H-Street acquired the remaining 50% interest in that fee.  In April 2007, we received letters from those tenants, Street Retail, Inc. and Post Apartment Homes, L.P., claiming they had a right of first offer triggered by each of those transactions. On September 25, 2008, both tenants filed suit against us and the former owners.  The claim alleges the right to purchase the fee interest, damages in excess of $75,000,000 and punitive damages.  We believe this claim is without merit and in our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, will not have a material effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows

.

Related Party Transactions

Loan and Compensation Agreements

Pursuant to our annual compensation review in February 2002 with Joseph Macnow, our Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee approved a $2,000,000 loan to Mr. Macnow, which bore interest at the applicable federal rate of 4.65% per annum and was scheduled to mature in June 2007. The loan was funded on July 23, 2002 and was collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the loan amount.  On March 26, 2007, Mr. Macnow repaid to us his $2,000,000 outstanding loan.

Effective as of April 19, 2007, we entered into a new employment agreement with Mitchell Schear, the President of our Washington, DC Office Division.  This agreement, which replaced his prior agreement, was approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Trustees and provides for a term of five years and is automatically renewable for one-year terms thereafter.  The agreement also provides for a minimum salary of $1,000,000 per year and bonuses and other customary benefits.  Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on April 19, 2007, the Compensation Committee granted options to Mr. Schear to acquire 200,000 of our common shares at an exercise price of $119.94 per share.  These options vest ratably over three years beginning in 2010 and accelerate on a change of control or if we terminate his employment without cause or by him for breach by us.  The agreement also provides that if
we terminate Mr. Schear’s employment without cause or by him for breach by us, he will receive a lump-sum payment equal to one year’s salary and bonus, up to a maximum of $2,000,000.

Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees of the Company

Alexander’s

We own 32.5% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President, are officers and directors of Alexander’s.  We provide various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements.  These agreements are described in Note 6 - Investments in Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

On September 9, 2008, Alexander’s Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $7.00 per share, payable on October 30, 2008, to shareholders of record on October 14, 2008.  The dividend was attributable to the liquidation of the wholly owned 731 Lexington Avenue taxable REIT subsidiary into Alexander’s.  Accordingly, on October 30, we received $11,578,000, which was accounted for as a reduction of our investment in Alexander’s.

On September 15, 2008 and October 14, 2008, Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, who holds the same positions in Alexander’s, exercised an aggregate of 200,000 of his SARs, which were scheduled to expire on March 4, 2009, and received gross proceeds of $62,809,000.

On March 13, 2007, Michael Fascitelli, our President, who also holds the same position in Alexander’s, exercised 350,000 of his SARs, which were scheduled to expire on March 14, 2007, and he received gross proceeds of $50,465,000.

Interstate Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board and Chief Executive Officer, is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s, are Interstate’s two other partners. As of December 31, 2008, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned approximately 8.8% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 27.0% of Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days’ notice at the end of the term. We believe based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies that the management agreement terms are fair to us. We earned $803,000, $800,000 and $798,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Minority Interest

Minority
    interest on our consolidated balance sheets aggregated $1,590,891,000
    and $2,074,601,000 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Of these balances, $1,177,977,000 and $1,658,303,000 respectively,
represent third-party limited partners’ interests in the
Operating Partnership; and $412,914,000 and $416,298,000, respectively,
represent the minority ownership of consolidated partially owned
entities.

Class
    A units of the Operating Partnership may be tendered for
    redemption to the Operating Partnership for cash; we, at
    our option, may assume that obligation and pay the holder
    either cash or Vornado common shares on a one-for-one basis.
    Because the number of Vornado common shares outstanding at
    all times equals the number of Class A units owned by Vornado,
    the redemption value of each Class A unit is equivalent to
    the market value of one Vornado common share, and the quarterly
    distribution to a Class A unitholder is equal to the quarterly
    dividend paid to a Vornado common shareholder. As of December
    31, 2008, as part of our preparation for the adoption of
    SFAS 160, which is effective for us on January 1, 2009, we
    have retroactively adopted the measurement provisions of
    EITF Topic D-98,

Classification and
    Measurement of Redeemable Securities

, and accordingly, have reduced the carrying amounts of
    these Class A units by $404,447,000 and $467,165,000, as
    of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, to reflect the
    change in their redemption value at the end of each reporting
    period. The corresponding entry for these adjustments were
    recorded to “additional
    capital.” As
    of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the aggregate redemption value
    of the then outstanding Class A units of the Operating Partnership
    owned by third parties was approximately $882,740,000 and
    $1,365,874,000 respectively.

Class B-1 and B-2 units are convertible into Class A units at a rate of 100 Class A units for each pairing of 100 Class B-1 units and 218 Class B-2 units.  Class B-1 unitholders are entitled to receive, in liquidation, an amount equal to the positive difference, if any, between the amount paid in liquidation for a Class A unit and the amount paid in respect of a Class B-2 unit multiplied by 2.18.  Class B-2 unitholders are entitled to receive in liquidation the lesser of $50 per unit or the amount paid in respect of a Class A unit on liquidation divided by 2.18.  Class B-1 unitholders receive distributions only if, and to the extent that, we pay quarterly dividends on the Class A units in excess of $0.85 per unit.  Class B-2 unitholders are expected to receive quarterly distributions of $0.39 per unit.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

20.

Segment Information - continued

Notes to preceding tabular information:

(1)

EBITDA represents “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.”  Management considers EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the un-levered performance of its segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)

As of January 1, 2008, we transferred the operations and financial results related to 409 3

rd

Street, NW (Washington Office Center) from the Merchandise Mart segment to the Washington, DC Office segment for both the current and prior periods presented.

(3)

Interest and debt expense and depreciation and amortization and income tax (benefit) expense in the reconciliation of net income to EBITDA include our share of these items from partially owned entities.

(4)

Other EBITDA is comprised of:

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures:  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 (e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:  There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Vornado Realty Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.

As of December 31, 2008, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 was effective.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the trustees of us; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 177, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board of Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We have audited  the internal control over financial reporting of Vornado Realty Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of trustees, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 of the Company and our report dated February 24, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.
