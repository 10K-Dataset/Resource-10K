PART I

ITEM 1.        BUSINESS

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”).  Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors.  Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 93.5% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2011.  All references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership.

As of December 31, 2011, we own all or portions of:

Office Properties:

·

In Midtown Manhattan – 30 properties aggregating 20.8 million square feet;

·

In the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area – 77 properties aggregating 20.5 million square feet, including 63 office properties aggregating 17.5 million square feet and seven residential properties containing 2,424 units;

Other real estate and related investments, marketable securities and mezzanine loans on real estate, including a 26.2% equity interest in LNR Property Corporation, an industry leading mortgage servicer and special servicer.


Objectives and Strategy

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value.
We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment
philosophy and executing our operating strategies through:

·

Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment
professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

·

Investing in properties in select markets, such as
New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high
likelihood of capital appreciation;

·

Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement
cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

·

Investing in retail properties in select under-stored
locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;

·

Developing and redeveloping our existing properties to
increase returns and maximize value; and

·

Investing in operating companies that have a significant
real estate component.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and
investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales
and by accessing the public and private capital markets.  We may also offer
Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange
for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the
future.

VorNADO CAPITAL PARTNERS REAL ESTATE FUND (The
“FUND”)

In February 2011, the
Fund’s subscription period closed with an aggregate of $800,000,000 of capital
commitments, of which we committed $200,000,000.  We are the general
partner and investment manager of the Fund, which has an eight-year term and a
three-year investment period.  During the investment period, which
concludes in July 2013, the Fund is our exclusive investment vehicle for all
investments that fit within its investment parameters, including debt, equity
and other interests in real estate, and excluding (i) investments in vacant land
and ground-up development; (ii) investments acquired by merger or primarily for
our securities or properties; (iii) properties which can be combined with or
relate to our existing properties; (iv) securities of commercial mortgage loan
servicers and investments derived from any such investments; (v) non-controlling
interests in equity and debt securities; and (vi) investments located outside of
North America.   The Fund is accounted for under the AICPA Investment
Company Guide and its investments are reported on its balance sheet at fair
value, with changes in value each period recognized in earnings.  We
consolidate the accounts of the Fund into our consolidated financial statements,
retaining the fair value basis of accounting.

During 2011, the Fund
made three investments (described below) aggregating $248,500,000 and exited two
investments.  As of December 31, 2011, the Fund has five investments with
an aggregate fair value of approximately $346,650,000, or $11,995,000 in excess
of cost, and has remaining unfunded commitments of $416,600,000, of which our
share is $104,150,000.

One
Park Avenue

On March 1, 2011, the
Fund as a co-investor (64.7% interest), together with Vornado (30.3% interest),
acquired a 95% interest in One Park Avenue, a 932,000 square foot office
building located between 32

nd

and 33

rd

Streets in New
York, for $374,000,000.  The purchase price consisted of $137,000,000 in
cash and 95% of a $250,000,000 five-year mortgage that bears interest at 5.0%.

Crowne Plaza Times
Square

On December 16, 2011,
the Fund formed a joint venture with the owner of the property to recapitalize
the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Times Square.  The property is located at 48th
Street and Broadway in Times Square and is comprised of a 795-key hotel, 14,000
square feet of prime retail space, 212,000 square feet of office space, nine
large signage offerings, a 159-space parking garage and a health club.  The
joint venture plans to reconfigure and reposition the retail and office space as
well as add additional signage.  Vornado will manage and lease the
commercial components of the property and the joint venture partner will asset
manage the hotel.  This transaction was initiated by us in May 2011, when
the Fund acquired a $34,000,000 mezzanine position in the junior most tranche of
the property’s mezzanine debt.  In December 2011, the Fund contributed
$31,000,000 and its partner contributed $22,000,000 of new capital to pay down
third party debt and for future capital expenditures.  The new capital was
contributed in the form of debt that is convertible into preferred equity that
receives a priority return and then will receive a profit participation. 
The Fund has an economic interest of approximately 38% in the property. 
The Fund’s investment is subordinate to the property’s $259,000,000 of senior
debt which matures in December 2013, with a one-year extension
option.

two retail units aggregating 5,000 square feet.  The Fund provided

two years.  In addition, the Fund has also provided a $21,000,000 mezzanine
loan on the residential portion of the property, which bears paid-in-kind
interest at 15%, matures in three years and has a one-year extension
option.

ACQUISITIONS and
investments

1399 New York Avenue (the “Executive
Tower”)

On December 23, 2011, we acquired the 97.5% interest that
we did not already own in the Executive Tower, an 11-story, 128,000 square foot
Class A office building located in the Washington, CBD East End submarket close
to the White House, for $104,000,000 in cash.

666 Fifth Avenue Office

On December 16, 2011, we formed a joint venture with an
affiliate of the Kushner Companies to recapitalize the office portion of 666
Fifth Avenue, a 39-story, 1.4 million square foot Class A office building in
Manhattan, located on the full block front of Fifth Avenue between 52nd and 53rd
Street.  We acquired a 49.5% interest in the property from the Kushner
Companies, the current owner.  In connection therewith, the existing
$1,215,000,000 mortgage loan was modified by LNR, the special servicer, into a
$1,100,000,000 A-Note and a $115,000,000 B-Note and extended to February 2019;
and a portion of the current pay interest was deferred to the B-Note.  We
and the Kushner Companies have committed to lend the joint venture an aggregate
of $110,000,000 (of which our share is $80,000,000) for tenant improvements and
working capital for the property, which is senior to the $115,000,000 B-Note. In
addition, we have provided the A-Note holders a limited recourse and cooperation
guarantee of up to $75,000,000 if an event of default occurs and is ongoing.

Independence Plaza

On June 17, 2011, a joint venture in which we are a 51%
partner invested $55,000,000 in cash (of which we contributed $35,000,000) to
acquire a face amount of $150,000,000 of mezzanine loans and a $35,000,000
participation in a senior loan on Independence Plaza, a residential complex
comprised of three 39-story buildings in the Tribeca submarket of
Manhattan.

280 Park Avenue Joint Venture

On March 16, 2011, we formed a 50/50 joint venture with
SL Green Realty Corp to own the mezzanine debt of 280 Park Avenue, a 1.2 million
square foot office building located between 48th and 49th Streets in Manhattan
(the “Property”).  We contributed our mezzanine loan with a face amount of
$73,750,000 and they contributed their mezzanine loans with a face amount of
$326,250,000 to the joint venture.  We equalized our interest in the joint
venture by paying our partner $111,250,000 in cash and assuming $15,000,000 of
their debt.  On May 17, 2011, as part of the recapitalization of the
Property, the joint venture contributed its debt position for 99% of the common
equity of a new joint venture which owns the Property.  The new joint
venture’s investment is subordinate to $710,000,000 of third party debt. 
The new joint venture expects to spend $150,000,000 for re-tenanting and
repositioning the Property.


Dispositions

On January 6, 2012, we completed the sale of 350 West
Mart Center, a 1.2 million square foot office building located in Chicago,
Illinois, for $228,000,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $54,200,000
that will be recognized in the first quarter of 2012.

On March 31, 2011, the receiver completed the disposition
of the High Point Complex in North Carolina.  In connection therewith, the
property and related debt were removed from our consolidated balance sheet and
we recognized a net gain of $83,907,000 on the extinguishment of
debt.

On January 12, 2011, we sold 1140 Connecticut Avenue and
1227 25

th

Street in Washington, DC, for $127,000,000 in cash, which
resulted in a net gain of $45,862,000.

In 2011, we sold three retail properties in separate
transactions for an aggregate of $40,990,000 in cash, which resulted in net
gains of $5,761,000.

Financing Activities

Senior Unsecured Debt

On November 30, 2011, we completed a public offering of
$400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.0%, ten-year senior unsecured notes
and retained net proceeds of approximately $395,584,000.  The notes were
sold at 99.546% of their face amount to yield 5.057%.

In 2011, we renewed both of our unsecured revolving
credit facilities aggregating $2,500,000,000.  The first facility, which
was renewed in June 2011, bears interest on drawn amounts at LIBOR plus 1.35%
and has a 0.30% facility fee (drawn or undrawn).  The second facility,
which was renewed in November 2011, bears interest on drawn amounts at LIBOR
plus 1.25% and has a 0.25% facility fee (drawn or undrawn).  The LIBOR
spread and facility fee on both facilities are based on our credit
ratings.  Both facilities mature in four years and have one-year extension
options.  As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $138,000,000 was
outstanding under these facilities.

Secured Debt

On January 9, 2012, we completed a $300,000,000

The five-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 3.75% and amortizes based on a
30-year schedule beginning in the third year. The proceeds of the new loan and
$132,000,000 of existing cash were used to repay the existing loan and closing
costs.

On December 28, 2011, we completed a $330,000,000
refinancing of Eleven Penn Plaza, a 1.1 million square foot Manhattan office
building. The seven-year loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.35% and amortizes
based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the fourth year. We retained net
proceeds of approximately $126,000,000 after repaying the existing loan and
closing

bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%, which was swapped for the term of the loan
to a fixed rate of 5.13%.  The loan amortizes based on a 30-year schedule
beginning in the fourth year.  We retained net proceeds of approximately
$139,000,000 after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.

February 10, 2011, we completed a $150,000,000 financing of 2121 Crystal Drive,
a 506,000 square foot office building located in Crystal City, Arlington,
Virginia.  The 12-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 5.51% and

Preferred Equity

On April 20, 2011, we sold 7,000,000 6.875% Series J
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at a price of $25.00 per share, in an
underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration
statement.  On April 21, 2011, the underwriters exercised their option to
purchase an additional 1,050,000 shares to cover over-allotments.  On May
5, 2011 and August 5, 2011 we sold an additional 800,000 and 1,000,000 shares,
respectively, at a price of $25.00 per share.  We retained aggregate net
proceeds of $238,842,000, after underwriters’ discounts and issuance costs and
contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for
9,850,000 Series J Preferred Units (with economic terms that mirror those of the
Series J Preferred Shares).


Development and Redevelopment Projects

We are evaluating various development and redevelopment opportunities which we estimate could require as much as $1.5 billion to be expended over the next five years. These opportunities include:

·

demolition of a 372,000 square foot office building in Crystal City, to construct a 700,000 square foot office building;

·

renovation of the Hotel Pennsylvania;

·

construction of a luxury residential condominium at 220 Central Park South, adjacent to Central Park;

·

re-tenanting and repositioning of 330 West 34

th

Street;

·

re-tenanting and repositioning of 280 Park Avenue;

·

complete renovation of the 1.4 million square foot Springfield Mall; and

·

re-tenanting and repositioning a number of our strip shopping centers.

We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in Manhattan, Rosslyn, Pentagon City and Crystal City, for which plans, budgeted costs and financings have yet to be determined.

Cleveland Medical Mart Development Project

In 2010, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into agreements with Cuyahoga County, Ohio (the “County”) to develop and operate the Cleveland Medical Mart and Convention Center (the “Facility”), a 1,000,000 square foot showroom, trade show and conference center in Cleveland’s central business district.  The County is funding the development of the Facility, using the proceeds it received from the issuance of general obligation bonds and other sources, up to the development budget of $465,000,000 and maintain effective control of the property.  During the 17-year development and operating period, our subsidiaries will receive net settled payments of approximately $10,000,000 per year, which are net of its $36,000,000 annual obligation to the County.  Our subsidiaries’ obligation has been pledged by the County to the bondholders, but is payable by our subsidiaries only to the extent that they first receive at least an equal payment from the County.  Construction of the Facility is expected to be completed in 2013.  As of December 31, 2011, $145,824,000 of the $465,000,000 development budget was expended.

There can be no assurance that any of our development projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed on schedule or within budget.


SEGMENT
DATA

We operate in the following business segments: New York
Office Properties, Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties,
Merchandise Mart Properties and Toys “R” Us (“Toys”).  Financial
information related to these business segments for the years ended December 31,
2011, 2010 and 2009 is set forth in Note 22 – Segment Information to our
consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
The Merchandise Mart Properties segment has trade show operations in Canada and
Switzerland. The Toys segment has 770 locations internationally.

SEASONALITY

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality
during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from
operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the current quarter to the
previous quarter. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys’
fourth quarter net income, which we record on a one-quarter lag basis in our
first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. The New
York and Washington, DC Office Properties and Merchandise Mart Properties
segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and
third quarters of the year. The Merchandise Mart Properties segment has also
experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to
major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail Properties segment
revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of
percentage and specialty rental income.

tenants ACCOUNTING FOR over 10% of
revenues

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total
revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Certain Activities

We do not base our acquisitions and investments on
specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our
properties for long‑term investment; however, it is possible that properties in
the portfolio may be sold as circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted
a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested
in a specific property or property type. While we may seek the vote of our
shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally
our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by our Board
of Trustees without the vote of shareholders.

ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS

Material factors that may adversely affect our business,
operations and financial condition are summarized below.  The risks and
uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones we face. 
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we
currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. 
See “Forward-Looking Statements” contained herein on page 3.

Real Estate Investments’ Value and Income
Fluctuate Due to Various Factors.

The value of real estate fluctuates depending on
conditions in the general economy and the real estate business. These conditions
may also adversely impact our revenues and cash flows.

The factors that affect the value of our real estate
investments include, among other things:

·

national,
regional and local economic conditions;

·

competition from other available space;

·

local
conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real
estate in the area;

·

how well
we manage our properties;

·

the
development and/or redevelopment of our properties;

·

changes
in market rental rates;

·

the
timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;

·

whether
we are able to pass all or portions of any increases in operating costs through
to tenants;

·

changes
in real estate taxes and other expenses;

·

whether
tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property
attractive;

·

the
financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies
or defaults;

·

availability of financing on acceptable terms or at
all;

·

fluctuations in interest rates;

·

our
ability to obtain adequate insurance;

·

changes
in zoning laws and taxation;

·

government regulation;

·

consequences of any armed conflict involving, or
terrorist attack against, the United States;

·

potential
liability under environmental or other laws or regulations;

·

natural
disasters;

·

general
competitive factors; and

·

climate
changes.

The rents we receive and the occupancy levels at our
properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors.
If rental revenues and/or occupancy levels decline, we generally would expect to
have less cash available to pay indebtedness and for distribution to
shareholders. In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage
payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs generally do not decline when
the related rents decline.

Capital markets and
economic conditions can materially affect our financial condition and results of
operations and the value of our debt and equity securities.

There are many factors that can affect the value of our
debt and equity securities, including the state of the capital markets and the
economy, which over the past few years have negatively affected substantially
all businesses, including ours.  Demand for office and retail space may
continue to decline nationwide as it did in 2008 and 2009, due to bankruptcies,
downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting.  The cost and availability of credit
may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads,
which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the
liquidity and financial condition of our tenants.  Our inability or the
inability of our tenants to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the
capital markets to meet liquidity needs may materially affect our financial
condition and results of operations and the value of our debt and equity
securities.

Real estate is a
competitive business.

Our business segments – New York Office Properties,
Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties, Merchandise Mart Properties
and Toys – operate in a highly competitive environment. We have a large
concentration of properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the
Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area. We compete with a large number of
property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower
returns on their investments than we are. Principal factors of competition
include rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property
and the breadth and quality of services provided. Our success depends upon,
among other factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies,
financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and
customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs,
taxes, governmental regulation, legislation and population trends.


We depend on leasing
space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from
tenants who may not be able to pay.

Our financial results depend significantly on leasing
space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms. In addition,
because a majority of our income comes from renting of real property, our
income, funds available to pay indebtedness and funds available for distribution
to shareholders will decrease if a significant number of our tenants cannot pay
their rent or if we are not able to maintain occupancy levels on favorable
terms. If a tenant does not pay its rent, we may not be able to enforce our
rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs. 
During periods of economic adversity, there may be an increase in the number of
tenants that cannot pay their rent and an increase in vacancy rates.

Bankruptcy or
insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenue, net income and available
cash.

From time to time, some of our tenants have declared
bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the
future. In the case of our shopping centers, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a
major tenant could cause us to suffer lower revenues and operational
difficulties, including leasing the remainder of the property. As a result, the
bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could result in decreased revenue,
net income and funds available for the payment of indebtedness or for
distribution to shareholders.

We may incur costs to
comply with environmental laws.

Our operations and properties are subject to various
federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the
environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and
health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or
operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or
toxic substances released at a property. The owner or operator may also be held
liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or
personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those
parties because of the contamination. These laws often impose liability without
regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or
caused the release. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate
contamination may impair our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow
using the real estate as collateral. Other laws and regulations govern indoor
and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or
removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition,
renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos
fibers in the air. The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain
electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and underground
storage tanks are also regulated by federal and state laws. We are also subject
to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants
such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be
alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in
susceptible individuals. We could incur fines for environmental compliance and
be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing
regulated substances or tanks or related claims arising out of environmental
contamination or human exposure to contamination at or from our
properties.

Each of our properties has been subject to varying
degrees of environmental assessment. The environmental assessments did not, as
of this date, reveal any environmental condition material to our business.
However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of
contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, discovery
of additional sites, human exposure to the contamination or changes in clean-up
or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us.

Inflation or deflation
may adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.

Although neither inflation nor deflation has materially
impacted our operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a
pronounced negative impact on our mortgages and interest rates and general and
administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our
rents.  Inflation could also have an adverse effect on consumer spending
which could impact our tenants’ sales and, in turn, our percentage rents, where
applicable.  Conversely, deflation could lead to downward pressure on rents
and other sources of income.  In addition, we own residential properties
which are leased to tenants with one-year lease terms.  Because these are
short-term leases, declines in market rents will impact our residential
properties faster than if the leases were for longer terms.


Some of our potential
losses may not be covered by insurance.

We maintain general
liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all risk
property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence,
including coverage for terrorist acts, with sub-limits for certain perils such
as floods.  Our California properties have earthquake insurance with
coverage of $180,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount
of 5% of the value of the affected property, up to a $180,000,000 annual
aggregate.

Penn Plaza Insurance
Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a
re-insurer with respect to all risk property and rental value insurance and a
portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for
coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and
radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program
Reauthorization Act. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is
fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government
with no exposure to PPIC.  Coverage for NBCR losses is up to $2.0 billion
per occurrence, for which PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and
15% of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible
for the remaining 85% of a covered loss.  We are ultimately responsible for
any loss borne by PPIC.

We continue to monitor
the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts
of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be
available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.

Our debt instruments,
consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to
us, senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior
debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring
us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance
coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an
equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if
lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely
affect our ability to finance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Because we operate a
hotel, we face the risks associated with the hospitality
industry.

We own and operate the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York
City. The following factors, among others, are common to the hotel industry and
may reduce the revenues generated by the hotel, which would reduce cash
available for distribution to our shareholders:

·

our hotel competes for guests with other hotels, a number
of which have greater marketing and financial resources;

·

if there is an increase in operating costs resulting from
inflation and other factors, we may not be able to offset such increase by
increasing room rates;

·

our hotel is subject to the fluctuating and seasonal
demands of business travelers and tourism;

·

our hotel is subject to general and local economic and
social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, including war
and terrorism; and

·

physical condition, which may require substantial
additional capital.

Because of the
ownership structure of the Hotel Pennsylvania, we face potential adverse effects
from changes to the applicable tax laws.

Under the Internal Revenue Code, REITs like us are not
allowed to operate hotels directly or indirectly. Accordingly, we lease the
Hotel Pennsylvania to our taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”). While the TRS
structure allows the economic benefits of ownership to flow to us, the TRS is
subject to tax on its income from the operations of the hotel at the federal and
state level. In addition, the TRS is subject to detailed tax regulations that
affect how it may be capitalized and operated. If the tax laws applicable to a
TRS are modified, we may be forced to modify the structure for owning the hotel,
and such changes may adversely affect the cash flows from the hotel. In
addition, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department
and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, and we cannot
predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations,
interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any such actions may prospectively
or retroactively modify the tax treatment of the TRS and, therefore, may
adversely affect our after-tax returns from the hotel.


Compliance or failure
to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety regulations
and requirements could result in substantial costs.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) generally
requires that public buildings, including our properties, meet certain federal
requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could
result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of
damages to private litigants. From time to time persons have asserted claims
against us with respect to some of our properties under the ADA, but to date
such claims have not resulted in any material expense or liability. If, under
the ADA, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital
expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access
barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to
shareholders.

Our properties are subject to various federal, state and
local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety
requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines
or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will
change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant
unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of
operations.

We face risks associated with our tenants being
designated “Prohibited Persons” by the Office of Foreign Assets
Control.

Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws, the
Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury
(“OFAC”) maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are
otherwise blocked or banned (“Prohibited Persons”) from conducting business or
engaging in transactions in the United States.  Our leases, loans and other
agreements may require us to comply with OFAC requirements.  If a tenant or
other party with whom we conduct business is placed on the OFAC list we may be
required to terminate the lease or other agreement.  Any such termination
could result in a loss of revenue or otherwise negatively affect our financial
results and cash flows.

Our business and operations would suffer in the event of
system failures.

Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security
measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal
information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any
number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy
blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication
failures.  Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our
operations could result in a material disruption to our business.  We may
also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such
disruptions.

The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our
cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to
our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information,
and/or damage to our business relationships, all of which could negatively
impact our financial results.

A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event
that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our
information resources. More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional
attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to
systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or steal confidential information.
As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our
systems, both internal and those we have outsourced. Our three primary risks
that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include
operational interruption, damage to our relationship with our tenants, and
private data exposure.  We have implemented processes, procedures and
controls to help mitigate these risks, but these measures, as well as our
increased awareness of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that our
financial results will not be negatively impacted by such an
incident.


Our Investments Are Concentrated in the New York CITY METROPOLITAN AREA and Washington, DC / NORTHERN VIRGINIA Area. Circumstances Affecting These Areas Generally Could Adversely Affect Our Business.

A significant portion of our properties are located in the New York City / New Jersey metropolitan area and Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area and are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent to those areas.

In 2011, approximately 74% of our EBITDA, excluding items that affect comparability, came from properties located in the New York City / New Jersey metropolitan areas and the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area. We may continue to concentrate a significant portion of our future acquisitions in these areas or in other geographic real estate markets in the United States or abroad. Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact these markets in either the short or long term. Declines in the economy or declines in real estate markets in these areas could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties. The factors affecting economic conditions in these regions include:

·

financial performance and productivity of the publishing, advertising, financial, technology, retail, insurance and

real estate industries;

·

space needs of, and budgetary constraints affecting, the United States Government, including the effect of a deficit reduction plan and/or base closures and repositioning under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 2005, as amended;

·

business layoffs or downsizing;

·

industry slowdowns;

·

relocations of businesses;

·

changing demographics;

·

increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places;

·

infrastructure quality; and

·

any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.

It is impossible for us to assess the future effects of trends in the economic and investment climates of the geographic areas in which we concentrate, and more generally of the United States, or the real estate markets in these areas.  Local, national or global economic downturns, would negatively affect our businesses and profitability.

Terrorist attacks, such as those of September 11, 2001 in New York City and the Washington, DC area, may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.

We have significant investments in large metropolitan areas, including the New York, Washington, DC, Chicago, Boston and San Francisco metropolitan areas. In the aftermath of a terrorist attack, tenants in these areas may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in these areas. This, in turn, would trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these areas, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease space on less favorable terms. As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues and cash flows could decline materially.

We May Acquire or Sell Assets or Entities or Develop Properties. Our Failure or Inability to Consummate These Transactions or Manage the Results of These Transactions Could Adversely Affect Our Operations and Financial Results.

We have grown rapidly since 2001 through acquisitions. We may not be able to maintain this rapid growth and our failure to do so could adversely affect our stock price.

We have experienced rapid growth since 2001, increasing our total assets from approximately $6.8 billion at December 31, 2001 to approximately $20.4 billion at December 31, 2011. We may not be able to maintain a similar rate of growth in the future or manage growth effectively. Our failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the amount of cash available for distributions to shareholders.


We may acquire or
develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may
create risks.

We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other
real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development
is consistent with our business strategy. We may not, however, succeed in
consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or
within budget. In addition, we may face competition in pursuing acquisition or
development opportunities that could increase our costs. When we do pursue a
project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly-developed or
acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover costs of acquisition or
development and operations.  Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may
prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management’s attention.
Acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have
the same level of market knowledge may result in weaker than anticipated
performance. We may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that
we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already
incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated.
Furthermore, acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the
liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware
of at the time of acquisition. Development of our existing properties presents
similar risks.

From time to time we
have made, and in the future we may seek to make, one or more material
acquisitions.  The announcement of such a material acquisition may result
in a rapid and significant decline in the price of our common
shares.

We are continuously looking at material transactions that
we believe will maximize shareholder value.  However, an announcement by us
of one or more significant acquisitions could result in a quick and significant
decline in the price of our common shares and convertible and exchangeable
securities.

It may be difficult to
buy and sell real estate quickly, which may limit our
flexibility.

Real estate investments are relatively difficult to buy
and sell quickly. Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary our
portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other
conditions.

We may not be
permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the debt associated with
those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring
additional costs.

As part of an acquisition of a property, or a portfolio
of properties, we may agree, and in the past have agreed, not to dispose of the
acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness for a long-term period,
unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the seller. These agreements
could result in us holding on to properties that we would otherwise sell and not
pay down or refinance.

From time to time we
make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control. Some of
these companies operate in industries that differ from our current operations,
with different risks than investing in real estate.

From time to time we make debt or equity investments in
other companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole
control. These investments include but are not limited
to, Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”), Toys “R” Us (“Toys”), Lexington
Realty Trust (“Lexington”), J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (“J.C. Penney”), LNR
Property Corporation (“LNR”) and other equity and mezzanine investments.
Although these businesses generally have a significant real estate component,
some of them operate in businesses that are different from our primary lines of
business including, without limitation, operating or managing toy stores and
department stores. Consequently, investments in these businesses, among other
risks, subjects us to the operating and financial risks of industries other than
real estate and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations
of these businesses. From time to time we may make additional investments in or
acquire other entities that may subject us to similar risks. Investments in
entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures,
present additional risks such as having differing objectives than our partners
or the entities in which we invest, or becoming involved in disputes, or
competing with those persons. In addition, we rely on the internal controls and
financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain
effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may adversely affect us.

We are subject to
risks that affect the general retail environment.

A substantial portion of our properties are in the retail
shopping center real estate market and we have a significant investment in
retailers such as Toys and J.C. Penney. This means that we are subject to
factors that affect the retail environment generally, including the level of
consumer spending and consumer confidence, the threat of terrorism and
increasing competition from discount retailers, outlet malls, retail websites
and catalog companies. These factors could adversely affect the financial
condition of our retail tenants and the retailers in which we hold an investment
and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers, and in
turn, adversely affect us.


Our investment in Toys subjects us to risks that are different from our other lines of business and may result in increased seasonality and volatility in our reported earnings.

Because Toys is a retailer, its operations subject us to the risks of a retail company that are different than those presented by our other lines of business. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. In addition, our fiscal year ends on December 31 whereas, as is common for retailers, Toys’ fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. Therefore, we record our pro rata share of Toys’ net earnings on a one-quarter lag basis. For example, our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2011 include Toys’ financial results for its first, second and third quarters ended October 29, 2011, as well as Toys’ fourth quarter results of 2010. Because of the seasonality of Toys, our reported quarterly net income shows increased volatility. We may also, in the future and from time to time, invest in other businesses that may report financial results that are more volatile than our historical financial results.

We depend upon our anchor tenants to attract shoppers.

We own several regional malls and other shopping centers that are typically anchored by well-known department stores and other tenants who generate shopping traffic at the mall or shopping center. The value of our properties would be adversely affected if tenants or anchors failed to meet their contractual obligations, sought concessions in order to continue operations or ceased their operations, including as a result of bankruptcy. If the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to economic conditions, closing of anchors or for other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the event of a default by a tenant or anchor, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord.

Our decision to dispose of real estate assets would change the holding period assumption in our valuation analyses, which could result in material impairment losses and adversely affect our financial results.

We evaluate real estate assets for impairment based on the projected cash flow of the asset over our anticipated holding period.  If we change our intended holding period, due to our intention to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset, then under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must reevaluate whether that asset is impaired.  Depending on the carrying value of the property at the time we change our intention and the amount that we estimate we would receive on disposal, we may record an impairment loss that would adversely affect our financial results. This loss could be material to our results of operations in the period that it is recognized.

We invest in subordinated or mezzanine debt of certain entities that have significant real estate assets.  These investments involve greater risk of loss than investments in senior mortgage loans.

We invest, and may in the future invest, in subordinated or mezzanine debt of certain entities that have significant real estate assets.  These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate.  These investments involve a greater risk of loss than investments in senior mortgage loans which are secured by real property.  If a borrower defaults on debt to us or on debt senior to us, or declares bankruptcy, we may not be able to recover some or all of our investment.  In addition, there may be significant delays and costs associated with the process of foreclosing on collateral securing or supporting these investments.  The value of the assets securing or supporting our investments could deteriorate over time due to factors beyond our control, including acts or omissions by owners, changes in business, economic or market conditions, or foreclosure.  Such deteriorations in value may result in the recognition of impairment losses and/or valuation allowances on our statements of income.  As of December 31, 2011, our investments in mezzanine debt securities have an aggregate carrying amount of $133,948,000.

We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such amounts may not be recoverable.  A loan is impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  There can be no assurance that our estimates of collectible amounts will not change over time or that they will be representative of the amounts we will actually collect, including amounts we would collect if we chose to sell these investments before their maturity.  If we collect less than our estimates, we will record impairment losses which could be material.


We invest in
marketable equity securities of companies that have significant real estate
assets.  The value of these investments may decline as a result of
operating performance or economic or market conditions.

We invest in marketable equity securities of
publicly-traded real estate companies or companies that have significant real
estate assets, such as J.C. Penney.  As of December 31, 2011, our
marketable securities have an aggregate carrying amount of $741,321,000. 
Significant declines in the value of these investments due to operating
performance or economic or market conditions may result in the recognition of
impairment losses which could be material.

Our Organizational and Financial
Structure Gives Rise to Operational and Financial Risks.

We May Not Be
Able to Obtain Capital to Make Investments.

We depend primarily on external financing to fund the
growth of our business. This is because one of the requirements of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for a REIT is that it distributes 90% of its
taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its shareholders. There is a
separate requirement to distribute net capital gains or pay a corporate level
tax in lieu thereof. Our access to debt or equity financing depends on the
willingness of third parties to lend or make equity investments and on
conditions in the capital markets generally. Although we believe that we will be
able to finance any investments we may wish to make in the foreseeable future,
there can be no assurance that new financing will be available or available on
acceptable terms.  For information about our available sources of funds,
see

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital
Resources”

and the notes to the consolidated financial
statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Vornado Realty Trust
(“Vornado”) depends on dividends and distributions from its direct and indirect
subsidiaries. The creditors and preferred security holders of these subsidiaries
are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the
subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to
Vornado.

Substantially all of Vornado’s assets are held through
its Operating Partnership that holds substantially all of its properties and
assets through subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership’s cash flow is dependent
on cash distributions to it by its subsidiaries, and in turn, substantially all
of Vornado’s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by the Operating
Partnership. The creditors of each of Vornado’s direct and indirect subsidiaries
are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations to them, when due and
payable, before distributions may be made by that subsidiary to its equity
holders. Thus, the Operating Partnership’s ability to make distributions to
holders of its units depends on its subsidiaries’ ability first to satisfy their
obligations to their creditors and then to make distributions to the Operating
Partnership. Likewise, Vornado’s ability to pay dividends to holders of common
and preferred shares depends on the Operating Partnership’s ability first to
satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions payable to
holders of preferred units and then to make distributions to Vornado.

Furthermore, the holders of preferred units of the
Operating Partnership are entitled to receive preferred distributions before
payment of distributions to holders of Class A units of the Operating
Partnership, including Vornado. Thus, Vornado’s ability to pay cash dividends to
its shareholders and satisfy its debt obligations depends on the Operating
Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make
distributions to holders of its preferred units and then to holders of its Class
A units, including Vornado.  As of December 31, 2011, there were six series
of preferred units of the Operating Partnership not held by Vornado with a total
liquidation value of $280,955,000.

In addition, Vornado’s participation in any distribution
of the assets of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the
liquidation, reorganization or insolvency, is only after the claims of the
creditors, including trade creditors and preferred security holders, are
satisfied.


We have outstanding
debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may increase and refinancing may not
be available on acceptable terms.

As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $14.5
billion of total debt outstanding, including our pro rata share of debt of
partially owned entities, and excluding $33.3 billion for our pro rata share of
LNR’s liabilities related to its consolidated CMBS and CDO trusts, which are
non-recourse to LNR and its equity holders, including us.  Our ratio of
total debt to total enterprise value was approximately 47%. When we say
“enterprise value” in the preceding sentence, we mean market equity value of our
common and preferred shares plus total debt outstanding, including our pro rata
share of debt of partially owned entities, and excluding LNR’s liabilities
related to its consolidated CMBS and CDO trusts.  In the future, we may
incur additional debt to finance acquisitions or property developments and thus
increase our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value. If our level of
indebtedness increases, there may be an increased risk of a credit rating
downgrade or a default on our obligations that could adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in a rising interest
rate environment, the cost of existing variable rate debt and any new debt or
other market rate security or instrument may increase.  Furthermore, we may
not be able to refinance existing indebtedness in sufficient amounts or on
acceptable terms.

Covenants in our debt
instruments could adversely affect our financial condition and our acquisitions
and development activities.

The mortgages on our properties contain customary
covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the
lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue insurance
coverage. Our unsecured credit facilities, unsecured debt securities and other
loans that we may obtain in the future contain, or may contain, customary
restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur
indebtedness, including covenants that limit our ability to incur debt based
upon the level of our ratio of total debt to total assets, our ratio of secured
debt to total assets, our ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, and fixed
charges, and that require us to maintain a certain level of unencumbered assets
to unsecured debt. Our ability to borrow is subject to compliance with these and
other covenants. In addition, failure to comply with our covenants could cause a
default under the applicable debt instrument, and we may then be required to
repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances,
other sources of capital may not be available to us, or may be available only on
unattractive terms.

We rely on debt financing, including borrowings under our
unsecured credit facilities, issuances of unsecured debt securities and debt
secured by individual properties, to finance acquisitions and development
activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt financing
from these or other sources, or refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity,
our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely
affected. If we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders can declare
a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of the property
securing the defaulted loan.

Vornado may fail to
qualify or remain qualified as a REIT and may be required to pay income taxes at
corporate rates.

Although we believe that we will remain organized and
will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes, we may fail to remain qualified in this way. Qualification as a REIT
for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and complex
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited
judicial or administrative interpretations. Our qualification as a REIT also
depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our
control. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative
interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with
respect to the requirements for qualification as a REIT or the federal income
tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT.

If, with respect to any taxable year, we fail to maintain
our qualification as a REIT and do not qualify under statutory relief
provisions, we could not deduct distributions to shareholders in computing our
taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on our taxable income at
regular corporate rates. The federal income tax payable would include any
applicable alternative minimum tax. If we had to pay federal income tax, the
amount of money available to distribute to shareholders and pay our indebtedness
would be reduced for the year or years involved, and we would no longer be
required to make distributions to shareholders. In addition, we would also be
disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the
year during which qualification was lost, unless we were entitled to relief
under the relevant statutory provisions. Although we currently intend to operate
in a manner designed to allow us to qualify as a REIT, future economic, market,
legal, tax or other considerations may cause us to revoke the REIT election or
fail to qualify as a REIT.


We face possible
adverse changes in tax laws, which may result in an increase in our tax
liability.

From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or
regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.
The shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in recent years may
lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes
occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These
increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations and the amount of cash available for payment of
dividends.

Loss of our key
personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common
shares.

We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, the
Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Vornado, and Michael D. Fascitelli, the
President and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado. While we believe that we could
find replacements for these and other key personnel, the loss of their services
could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common
shares.

Vornado’s charter documents and applicable law may hinder
any attempt to acquire us.

Our Amended and
Restated Declaration of Trust sets limits on the ownership of our
shares.

Generally, for Vornado to maintain its qualification as a
REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% in value of the
outstanding shares of beneficial interest of Vornado may be owned, directly or
indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of
Vornado’s taxable year. The Internal Revenue Code defines “individuals” for
purposes of the requirement described in the preceding sentence to include some
types of entities. Under Vornado’s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as
amended, no person may own more than 6.7% of the outstanding common shares of
any class, or 9.9% of the outstanding preferred shares of any class, with some
exceptions for persons who held common shares in excess of the 6.7% limit before
Vornado adopted the limit and other persons approved by Vornado’s Board of
Trustees. These restrictions on transferability and ownership may delay, deter
or prevent a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might
involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the
shareholders. We refer to Vornado’s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust,
as amended, as the “declaration of trust.”

Vornado has a
classified Board of Trustees and that may reduce the likelihood of certain
takeover transactions.

Vornado’s Board of Trustees is divided into three classes
of trustees. Trustees of each class are chosen for three-year staggered terms.
Staggered terms of trustees may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an
attempt to change control of Vornado, even though a tender offer or change in
control might be in the best interest of Vornado’s shareholders.

We may issue
additional shares in a manner that could adversely affect the likelihood of
certain takeover transactions.

Vornado’s declaration of trust authorizes the Board of
Trustees to:

·

cause
Vornado to issue additional authorized but unissued common shares or preferred
shares;

·

classify
or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred shares;

·

set the
preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified shares
that Vornado issues; and

·

increase,
without shareholder approval, the number of shares of beneficial interest that
Vornado may issue.

The Board of Trustees could establish a series of
preferred shares whose terms could delay, deter or prevent a change in control
of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise
be in the best interest of Vornado’s shareholders, although the Board of
Trustees does not now intend to establish a series of preferred shares of this
kind. Vornado’s declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that
may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado or other transaction
that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our
shareholders.


The Maryland General Corporation Law contains provisions that may reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, as amended, which we refer to as the “MGCL,” as applicable to REITs, certain “business combinations,” including certain mergers, consolidations, share exchanges and asset transfers and certain issuances and reclassifications of equity securities, between a Maryland REIT and any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the trust’s shares or an affiliate or an associate, as defined in the MGCL, of the trust who, at any time within the two-year period before the date in question, was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting shares of beneficial interest of the trust, which we refer to as an “interested shareholder,” or an affiliate of the interested shareholder, are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder. After that five-year period, any business combination of these kinds must be recommended by the board of trustees of the trust and approved by the affirmative vote of at least (a) 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares of beneficial interest of the trust and (b) two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting shares of beneficial interest of the trust other than shares held by the interested shareholder with whom, or with whose affiliate, the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested shareholder.  These supermajority voting requirements do not apply if the trust’s common shareholders receive a minimum price, as defined in the MGCL, for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares.

The provisions of the MGCL do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of trustees of the applicable trust before the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, and a person is not an interested shareholder if the board of trustees approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested shareholder.

In approving a transaction, the Board may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the Board.  Vornado’s Board has adopted a resolution exempting any business combination between Vornado and any trustee or officer of Vornado or its affiliates.  As a result, any trustee or officer of Vornado or its affiliates may be able to enter into business combinations with Vornado that may not be in the best interest of Vornado’s shareholders. With respect to business combinations with other persons, the business combination provisions of the MGCL may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the shareholders. The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of Vornado and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.

We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our shareholders.

Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other companies, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Trustees. Accordingly, our shareholders do not control these policies.

Our Ownership Structure and Related-Party Transactions May Give Rise to Conflicts of Interest.

Steven Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of our other trustees and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.

As of December 31, 2011, Interstate Properties, a New Jersey general partnership, and its partners owned an aggregate of approximately 6.3% of the common shares of Vornado and 27.2% of the common stock of Alexander’s, which is described below.  Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the three partners of Interstate Properties. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board of Vornado, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties and the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s. Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are trustees of Vornado and also directors of Alexander’s.

Because of these overlapping interests, Mr. Roth and Interstate Properties and its partners may have substantial influence over Vornado and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Vornado’s shareholders for approval. In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate Properties and our other equity or debt holders. In addition, Mr. Roth, Interstate Properties and its partners, and Alexander’s currently and may in the future engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as which of these entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these entities.


We currently manage and lease the real estate assets of
Interstate Properties under a management agreement for which we receive an
annual fee equal to 4% of base rent and percentage rent. The management
agreement has a one-year term and is automatically renewable unless terminated
by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term. Because of
the relationship among Vornado, Interstate Properties and Messrs. Roth,
Mandelbaum and Wight, as described above, the terms of the management agreement
and any future agreements between us and Interstate Properties may not be
comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third
party.

There may be conflicts
of interest between Alexander’s and us.

As of December 31, 2011, we owned 32.4% of the
outstanding common stock of Alexander’s. Alexander’s is a REIT engaged in
leasing, managing, developing and redeveloping properties, focusing primarily on
the locations where its department stores operated before they ceased operations
in 1992. Alexander’s has seven properties, which are located in the greater New
York metropolitan area.  In addition to the 2.0% that they indirectly own
through Vornado, Interstate Properties, which is described above, and its
partners owned 27.2% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s as of
December 31, 2011. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board of Vornado, the
managing general partner of Interstate Properties, and the Chairman of the Board
and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s.  Messrs. Wight and
Mandelbaum are trustees of Vornado and also directors of Alexander’s and general
partners of Interstate Properties.  Michael D. Fascitelli is the President
and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado and the President of Alexander’s and Dr.
Richard West is a trustee of Vornado and a director of Alexander’s.  In
addition, Joseph Macnow, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, holds the same position with Alexander’s.  Alexander’s common
stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
“ALX.”

We manage, develop and lease Alexander’s properties under
management and development agreements and leasing agreements under which we
receive annual fees from Alexander’s. These agreements have a one-year term
expiring in March of each year and are all automatically renewable. Because
Vornado and Alexander’s share common senior management and because certain of
the trustees of Vornado constitute a majority of the directors of Alexander’s,
the terms of the foregoing agreements and any future agreements between us and
Alexander’s may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an
unaffiliated third party.

Vornado and Alexander’s, see

substantial influence over us. They and some of our other trustees and officers

above.


The Number of Shares of Vornado Realty Trust and the Market for Those Shares Give Rise to Various Risks.

The trading price of our common shares has been volatile and may fluctuate.

The trading price of our common shares has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control.  In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies.  These broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our common shares.  Among the factors that could affect the price of our common shares are:

·

our financial condition and performance;

·

the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;

·

actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;

·

our dividend policy;

·

the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in

comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and fixed

income securities;

·

uncertainty and volatility in the equity and credit markets;

·

changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial

analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other real estate investment

trusts;

·

failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;

·

speculation in the press or investment community;

·

strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;

·

the extent of institutional investor interest in us;

·

the extent of short-selling of our common shares and the shares of our competitors;

·

fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;

·

general financial and economic market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions

for real estate investment trusts and other real estate related companies;

·

domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; and

·

all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report on the Form 10-K.

A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for shareholders.

Vornado has many shares available for future sale, which could hurt the market price of its shares.

The interests of our current shareholders could be diluted if we issue additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2011, we had authorized but unissued, 64,919,980 common shares of beneficial interest, $.04 par value and 67,813,291 preferred shares of beneficial interest, no par value; of which 28,304,971 common shares are reserved for issuance upon redemption of Class A Operating Partnership units, convertible securities and employee stock options and 5,800,000 preferred shares are reserved for issuance upon redemption of preferred Operating Partnership units.  Any shares not reserved may be issued from time to time in public or private offerings or in connection with acquisitions.  In addition, common and preferred shares reserved may be sold upon issuance in the public market after registration under the Securities Act or under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or other available exemptions from registration.  We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common and preferred shares or Operating Partnership Class A and preferred units will have on the market prices of our outstanding shares.

Increased market interest rates may hurt the value of our common and preferred shares.

We believe that investors consider the distribution rate on REIT shares, expressed as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates as an important factor in deciding whether to buy or sell the shares. If market interest rates go up, prospective purchasers of REIT shares may expect a higher distribution rate. Higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and might decrease funds available for distribution. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of our common and preferred shares to decline.

New York Office Properties lease terms generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 15 years for major tenants, and may provide for extension options at market rates. Leases typically provide for periodic step‑ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants their share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year. Electricity is provided to tenants on a sub-metered basis or included in rent based on surveys and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases. Leases also typically provide for free rent and tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.

Most leases include free rent and periodic step-ups in rent, which are not included in the initial cash basis rent per square foot leased, but are included in the GAAP basis straight-line rent per square foot (see "Overview - Leasing Activity" of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).

In addition to the office space noted above, during 2011 we leased 9,000 square feet of retail space contained in office buildings at an average initial rent of $184.78 per square foot, a 60.2% increase over the prior weighted average rent per square foot.

Washington, DC Office
Properties lease terms generally range from five to seven years, and may provide
for extension options at either pre-negotiated or market rates. Leases typically
provide for periodic step-ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass
through to tenants, the tenants’ share of increases in real estate taxes and
certain property operating expenses over a base year. Periodic step-ups in rent
are usually based upon either fixed percentage increases or the consumer price
index. Leases also typically provide for free rent and tenant improvement
allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of
its premises.

Base Realignment and Closure (“BRAC”)

Our Washington, DC Office Properties segment (as well as other landlords who lease space to the Department of Defense ("DOD")) is subject to the BRAC statute, which requires the DOD to relocate from 2,395,000 square feet in our buildings in the Northern Virginia area to government owned military bases.  The table below summarizes the effect of BRAC on our Washington, DC Office Properties segment for square feet leased by the DOD.  See page 76 for the estimated impact on 2012 EBITDA.

In February 2012, we notified the lender that the Skyline property currently has a 26% vacancy rate, which is expected to increase due to scheduled lease expirations resulting primarily from the BRAC statute. Based on the projected vacancy and the significant amount of capital, time and effort to re-tenant the property, we requested that the mortgage loan be placed with the special servicer.


RETAIL PROPERTIES

As of December 31,
2011, our portfolio consisted of 155 retail properties, of which 127 are strip
shopping centers and single tenant retail assets located primarily in the
Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and California; seven are regional malls located in New
York, New Jersey, Virginia and San Juan, Puerto Rico; and 21 are retail
properties located in Manhattan (“Manhattan Street Retail”).  Our strip
shopping centers and malls are generally located on major highways in mature,
densely populated areas, and therefore attract consumers from a regional, rather
than a neighborhood market place.

Strip Shopping
Centers

Our strip shopping
centers contain an aggregate of 16.9 million square feet, of which we own 16.3
million square feet.  These properties are substantially (approximately
80%) leased to large stores (over 20,000 square feet). Tenants include
destination retailers such as discount department stores, supermarkets, home
improvement stores, discount apparel stores and membership warehouse clubs.
Tenants typically offer basic consumer necessities such as food, health and
beauty aids, moderately priced clothing, building materials and home improvement
supplies, and compete primarily on the basis of price and location.

Regional
Malls

The Green Acres
Mall in Valley Stream, Long Island, New York contains 1.8 million square
feet, and is anchored by Macy’s, Sears, Wal-Mart, Kohl’s, JC Penney, Best Buy
and BJ’s Wholesale Club.

The Monmouth Mall in
Eatontown, New Jersey, in which we own a 50% interest, contains
1.5 million square feet and is anchored by Macy’s, Lord & Taylor, JC
Penney and Boscov’s, three of which own their stores aggregating 612,000 square
feet.

The Springfield Mall
in Springfield, Virginia, contains 1.4 million square feet and is anchored by
Macy’s, JC Penney and Target, two of which own their stores aggregating 390,000
square feet.  We plan a complete renovation of the mall beginning in
2012.

The Bergen Town Center
in Paramus, New Jersey contains 921,000 square feet and is anchored by Century
21, Whole Foods and Target.

The Broadway Mall in
Hicksville, Long Island, New York contains 1.1 million square feet and is
anchored by Macy’s, Ikea, National Amusements and Target, two of which own their
stores aggregating 376,000 square feet.

The
Montehiedra Mall in San Juan, Puerto Rico contains
541,000 square feet and is anchored by Home Depot, Kmart, and
Marshalls.

The Las Catalinas
Mall in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contains 495,000 square feet and is anchored
by Kmart and Sears, which owns its 139,000 square foot store.

Manhattan Street
Retail

Manhattan Street
Retail is comprised of 2.2 million square feet in 46 properties, of which 1.0
million square feet in 21 properties is in our Retail Properties segment and 1.2
million square feet in 25 properties is in our New York Office Properties
segment.  Manhattan Street Retail includes (i) properties on Fifth Avenue,
Madison Avenue and in SoHo, occupied by retailers such as Hennes & Mauritz
(Flagship), Coach (Flagship), Top Shop (Flagship), Madewell, Gucci, Chloe and
Cartier; (ii) 1540 Broadway in Times Square which contains 161,000 square feet,
anchored by Forever 21 (Flagship) and Disney (Flagship); (iii) 510 Fifth Avenue
which contains 59,000 square feet, anchored by Joe Fresh; (iv) 4 Union Square
South which contains 203,000 square feet, anchored by Whole Foods Market,
Forever 21 and DSW; and (v) properties in the Penn Plaza district, such as the
Manhattan Mall which contains 243,000 square feet, anchored by JC
Penney.

Retail Properties lease terms generally range from five years or less in some instances for smaller tenants to as long as 25 years for major tenants.  Leases generally provide for reimbursements of real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges (including roof and structure in strip shopping centers, unless it is the tenant’s direct responsibility), and percentage rents based on tenant sales volume.  Percentage rents accounted for less than 1% of the Retail Properties total revenues during 2011.

In November 2011, we entered into an agreement to sell
350 West Mart Center, a 1.2 million square foot office building located in
Chicago, Illinois, for $228,000,000.  Accordingly, we have reclassified the
results of operations of this property to “income (loss) from discontinued
operations,” and the related assets and liabilities to “assets related to
discontinued operations” and “liabilities related to discontinued operations”
for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 On January 6, 2012, we completed the sale of the property, which resulted
in a net gain of $54,200,000 that will be recognized in the first quarter of
2012.

Office lease terms generally range from three to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 15 years for major tenants. Leases typically provide for periodic step-ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants their share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year. Electricity is provided to tenants on a sub-metered basis or included in rent and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases. Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction of its premises.

Office tenants accounting for 2% or more of Merchandise Mart Properties’ 2011 total revenues

No tenant accounted for more than 2% of the Merchandise Mart Properties revenue in 2011.

Item 3.   Legal Proceedings

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including the matter referred to below, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In 2003, Stop & Shop filed an action against us in the New York Supreme Court, claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to a Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the leases to which the annual rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that an order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, as modified on appeal by the District Court, froze our right to reallocate and effectively terminated our right to collect the annual rent from Stop & Shop.  We asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid annual rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the annual rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect.   After summary judgment motions by both sides were denied, the parties conducted discovery.  A trial was held in November 2010.  On November 7, 2011, the Court determined that we have a continuing right to allocate the annual rent to unexpired leases covered by the Master Agreement and Guaranty, and directed entry of a judgment in our favor ordering Stop & Shop to pay us the unpaid annual rent accrued through February 28, 2011 in the amount of $37,422,000, a portion of the annual rent due from March 1, 2011 through the date of judgment, interest, and attorneys’ fees.  On December 16, 2011, a money judgment based on the Court’s decision was entered in our favor in the amount of $56,597,000 (including interest and costs).  The amount for attorneys’ fees is being addressed in a proceeding before a special referee.  Stop & Shop has appealed the Court’s decision and the judgment, and has posted a bond to secure payment of the judgment.  On January 12, 2012, we commenced a new action against Stop & Shop seeking recovery of $2,500,000 of annual rent not included in the money judgment, plus additional annual rent as it accrues.

As of December 31, 2011, we have a $41,983,000 receivable from Stop and Shop, excluding amounts due to us for interest and costs resulting from the Court’s judgment.  In the fourth quarter of 2011, based on the Court’s decision, we recognized $23,521,000 of income, representing the portion of the $41,983,000 receivable that was previously reserved.  As a result of Stop & Shop’s appeal, we believe, after consultation with counsel, that the maximum reasonably possible loss is up to the total amount of the receivable of $41,983,000.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities

During the fourth quarter of 2011, we issued 20,891 common shares upon the redemption of Class A units of the Operating Partnership held by persons who received units, in private placements in earlier periods, in exchange for their interests in limited partnerships that owned real estate. The common shares were issued without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance on Section 4 (2) of that Act.

Information relating to compensation plans under which our equity securities are authorized for issuance is set forth under Part III, Item 12 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and such information is incorporated by reference herein.

Recent Purchases of Equity Securities

In December 2011, we received 410,783 Vornado common shares at an average price of $76.36 per share as payment for the exercise price of certain employee options.


Performance Graph

The following graph is a comparison of the five-year cumulative return of our common shares, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (the “S&P 500 Index”) and the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts’ (“NAREIT”) All Equity Index (excluding health care real estate investment trusts), a peer group index.  The graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2006 in our common shares, the S&P 500 Index and the NAREIT All Equity Index and that all dividends were reinvested without the payment of any commissions.  There can be no assurance that the performance of our shares will continue in line with the same or similar trends depicted in the graph below.

________________________________

(1)   FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”).  In the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, NAREIT issued updated guidance on FFO and modified its definition of FFO to specifically exclude real estate impairment losses, including the pro rata share of such losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries.  To the extent applicable, NAREIT requested companies to restate prior period FFO to conform to the new definition.  Accordingly, we have restated our 2010 and 2009 FFO to exclude real estate impairment losses aggregating $108,981 and $23,203, respectively.  NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gain from sales of depreciated real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, extraordinary items and other specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions.  FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flows as a liquidity measure.  FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Overview

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”).  Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors.  Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 93.5% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2011.  All references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership.

We own and operate office, retail and showroom properties (our “core” operations) with large concentrations of office and retail properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area. In addition, we have a 32.7% interest in Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”) which has a significant real estate component, a 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX) (“Alexander’s”), which has seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, as well as interests in other real estate and related investments.

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. Below is a table comparing our performance to the Morgan Stanley REIT Index (“RMS”) and the SNL REIT Index (“SNL”) for the following periods ended December 31, 2011:

(1) Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance.

We intend to achieve our business objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through:

·

Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

·

Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;

·

Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

·

Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;

·

Developing and redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and

·

Investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets.  We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments than we are. Principal factors of competition include rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.  See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.

Vornado Capital Partners Real Estate Fund (the
“Fund”)

In February 2011, the
Fund’s subscription period closed with an aggregate of $800,000,000 of capital
commitments, of which we committed $200,000,000.  We are the general
partner and investment manager of the Fund, which has an eight-year term and a
three-year investment period.  During the investment period, which
concludes in July 2013, the Fund is our exclusive investment vehicle for all
investments that fit within its investment parameters, as defined.  The
Fund is accounted for under the AICPA Investment Company Guide and its
investments are reported on its balance sheet at fair value, with changes in
value each period recognized in earnings.  We consolidate the accounts of
the Fund into our consolidated financial statements, retaining the fair value
basis of accounting.

During 2011, the Fund
made three investments (described below) aggregating $248,500,000 and exited two
investments.  As of December 31, 2011, the Fund has five investments with
an aggregate fair value of approximately $346,650,000, or $11,995,000 in excess
of cost, and has remaining unfunded commitments of $416,600,000, of which our
share is $104,150,000.

One
Park Avenue

On March 1, 2011, the
Fund as a co-investor (64.7% interest), together with Vornado (30.3% interest),
acquired a 95% interest in One Park Avenue, a 932,000 square foot office
building located between 32

nd

and 33

rd

Streets in New
York, for $374,000,000.  The purchase price consisted of $137,000,000 in
cash and 95% of a $250,000,000 five-year mortgage that bears interest at 5.0%.

Crowne Plaza Times
Square

On December 16, 2011,
the Fund formed a joint venture with the owner of the property to recapitalize
the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Times Square.  The property is located at 48th
Street and Broadway in Times Square and is comprised of a 795-key hotel, 14,000
square feet of prime retail space, 212,000 square feet of office space, nine
large signage offerings, a 159-space parking garage and a health club.  The
joint venture plans to reconfigure and reposition the retail and office space as
well as add additional signage.  Vornado will manage and lease the
commercial components of the property and the joint venture partner will asset
manage the hotel.  This transaction was initiated by us in May 2011, when
the Fund acquired a $34,000,000 mezzanine position in the junior most tranche of
the property’s mezzanine debt.  In December 2011, the Fund contributed
$31,000,000 and its partner contributed $22,000,000 of new capital to pay down
third party debt and for future capital expenditures.  The new capital was
contributed in the form of debt that is convertible into preferred equity that
receives a priority return and then will receive a profit participation. 
The Fund has an economic interest of approximately 38% in the property. 
The Fund’s investment is subordinate to the property’s $259,000,000 of senior
debt which matures in December 2013, with a one-year extension option.

11 East

th

Street

On December 29, 2011,
the Fund committed to acquire the retail portion of 11 East 68th Street, an
11-story residential and retail property located on Madison Avenue and 68th
Street, for $50,500,000.  The retail portion of the property consists of
two retail units aggregating 5,000 square feet.  The Fund provided
$21,200,000 at closing and will provide the remaining $29,300,000 over the next
two years.  In addition, the Fund has also provided a $21,000,000 mezzanine
loan on the residential portion of the property, which bears paid-in-kind
interest at 15%, matures in three years and has a one-year extension
option.

2011 Acquisitions and Investments

1399 New York Avenue (the “Executive
Tower”)

On December 23, 2011, we acquired the 97.5% interest that
we did not already own in the Executive Tower, an 11-story, 128,000 square foot
Class A office building located in the Washington, CBD East End submarket close
to the White House, for $104,000,000 in cash.

666 Fifth Avenue Office

On December 16, 2011, we formed a joint venture with an
affiliate of the Kushner Companies to recapitalize the office portion of 666
Fifth Avenue, a 39-story, 1.4 million square foot Class A office
building

in Manhattan,

located on the full block front of Fifth Avenue between
52nd and 53rd Street.  We acquired a 49.5% interest in the property from
the Kushner Companies, the current owner.  In connection therewith, the
existing $1,215,000,000 mortgage loan was modified by LNR, the special servicer,
into a $1,100,000,000 A-Note and a $115,000,000 B-Note and extended to February
2019; and a portion of the current pay interest was deferred to the
B-Note.  We and the Kushner Companies have committed to lend the joint
venture an aggregate of $110,000,000 (of which our share is $80,000,000) for
tenant improvements and working capital for the property, which is senior to the
$115,000,000 B-Note. In addition, we have provided the A-Note holders a limited
recourse and cooperation guarantee of up to $75,000,000 if an event of default
occurs and is ongoing.

Independence Plaza

On June 17, 2011, a joint venture in which we are a 51%

acquire a face amount of $150,000,000 of mezzanine loans and a $35,000,000
participation in a senior loan on Independence Plaza, a residential complex
comprised of three 39-story buildings in the Tribeca submarket of

280 Park Avenue Joint Venture

On March 16, 2011, we formed a 50/50 joint venture with
SL Green Realty Corp to own the mezzanine debt of 280 Park Avenue, a 1.2 million

(the “Property”).  We contributed our mezzanine loan with a face amount of
$73,750,000 and they contributed their mezzanine loans with a face amount of
$326,250,000 to the joint venture.  We equalized our interest in the joint
venture by paying our partner $111,250,000 in cash and assuming $15,000,000 of
their debt.  On May 17, 2011, as part of the recapitalization of the
Property, the joint venture contributed its debt position for 99% of the common
equity of a new joint venture which owns the Property.  The new joint
venture’s investment is subordinate to $710,000,000 of third party debt. 
The new joint venture expects to spend $150,000,000 for re-tenanting and
repositioning the Property.

On January 6, 2012, we completed the sale of 350 West
Mart Center, a 1.2 million square foot office building located in Chicago,
Illinois, for $228,000,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $54,200,000
that will be recognized in the first quarter of 2012.

On March 31, 2011, the receiver completed the disposition
of the High Point Complex in North Carolina.  In connection therewith, the
property and related debt were removed from our consolidated balance sheet and
we recognized a net gain of $83,907,000 on the extinguishment of
debt.

We estimate that occupancy will decrease from 90% at December 31, 2011, to between 82% to 84% in 2012 and that 2012 EBITDA will be lower than 2011 by approximately $55,000,000 to $65,000,000, based on 2,902,000 square feet expiring in 2012, partially offset by leasing over 1,000,000 square feet.  A significant portion of the vacancy is related to the Base Realignment and Closure (“BRAC”) statute.  We estimate it will take approximately two to three years to fully absorb this vacancy and for EBITDA to recover.  The table below summarizes the effect of BRAC on our Washington, DC Office Properties segment for square feet leased by the DOD.

In February 2012, we notified the lender that the Skyline property currently has a 26% vacancy rate, which is expected to increase due to scheduled lease expirations resulting primarily from the BRAC statute. Based on the projected vacancy and the significant amount of capital, time and effort to re-tenant the property, we requested that the mortgage loan be placed with the special servicer.


Recently Issued
Accounting Literature

In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Update No. 2011-04,

Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Amendments to
Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP
and IFRS

(“ASU No. 2011-04”).  ASU
No. 2011-04 provides a uniform framework for fair value measurements and
related disclosures between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”) and requires additional disclosures, including: (i) quantitative
information about unobservable inputs used, a description of the valuation
processes used, and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the
measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs, for Level 3 fair value
measurements; (ii) fair value of financial instruments not measured at fair
value but for which disclosure of fair value is required, based on their levels
in the fair value hierarchy; and (iii) transfers between Level 1 and Level
2 of the fair value hierarchy.  ASU No. 2011-04 is effective for interim
and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011.  The
adoption of this update on January 1, 2012 is not expected to have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2011, the FASB issued Update No. 2011-05,

Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of
Comprehensive Income

(“ASU No. 2011-05”).  ASU No. 2011-05 requires the
presentation of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous
statement or in two separate but consecutive statements.  ASU No. 2011-05
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after
December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.  The Company early
adopted this guidance as of December 31, 2011, and has presented the
Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as a separate financial
statement.

In September 2011, the FASB issued Update No. 2011-09,

Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715):
Disclosures About an Employer’s Participation in a Multiemployer Plan (“ASU No.
2011-09”)

.  ASU No. 2011-09 requires enhanced
disclosures about an entity’s participation in multiemployer plans that offer
pension and other postretirement benefits.  ASU No. 2011-09 became
effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after December 15,
2011.  The adoption of this update on December 31, 2011 did not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting
Policies

In preparing the
consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set
forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical
to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  The summary
should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our
accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Real
Estate

Real estate is
carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. As of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of
accumulated depreciation, were $14.5 billion and $14.7 billion, respectively.
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation requires an
estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as
well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various
components. If we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly
estimate the useful lives of our real estate, depreciation expense may be
misstated.  As real estate is undergoing development activities, all
property operating expenses directly associated with and attributable to, the
development and construction of a project, including interest expense, are
capitalized to the cost of real property to the extent we believe such costs are
recoverable through the value of the property.  The capitalization period
begins when development activities are underway and ends when the project is
substantially complete.  General and administrative costs are expensed as
incurred.

Upon the acquisition
of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land,
buildings and improvements, identified intangibles such as acquired above and
below-market leases and acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and
acquired liabilities and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments.
We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize
appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market
information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of
factors, including historical operating results, known trends and
market/economic conditions.

Our properties,
including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying
amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the
anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis.  An impairment loss is
measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying amount over its
estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on our current plans,
intended holding periods and available market information at the time the
analyses are prepared.  If our estimates of the projected future cash
flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change, our evaluation
of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to
our consolidated financial statements.  The evaluation of anticipated cash
flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future
occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially
from actual results.  Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease
the likelihood of recording impairment losses.


Critical Accounting
Policies – continued

Identified Intangibles

As of December 31,
2011 and 2010, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets (including
acquired above-market leases, tenant relationships and acquired in-place leases)
were $319,704,000 and $346,157,000, respectively. The carrying amounts of
identified intangible liabilities, a component of “deferred credit” on our
consolidated balance sheets, were $467,187,000 and $521,372,000,
respectively.  Identified intangibles are recorded at their estimated fair
value, separate and apart from goodwill. Identified intangibles that are
determined to have finite lives are amortized over the period in which they are
expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the
property or business acquired.  Intangible assets that are subject to
amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An
impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of the
identified intangible over its estimated fair value.  If intangible assets
are impaired or estimated useful lives change, the impact to our consolidated
financial statements could be material.

Mezzanine Loans
Receivable

As of December 31,
2011 and 2010, the carrying amounts of mezzanine loans receivable were
$133,948,000 and $202,412,000, respectively.  We invest in mezzanine loans
of entities that have significant real estate assets.  These investments,
which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are
generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the
underlying real estate.  We record these investments at the stated
principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium.  We accrete or
amortize any discount or premium over the life of the related receivable
utilizing the effective interest method or straight-line method, if the result
is not materially different. We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and
principal of each of our loans whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate such amounts may not be recoverable. A loan is impaired when it is
probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the
existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss
accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the
present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective
interest rate, or as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if
the loan is collateral dependent. If our estimates of the collectability of both
interest and principal or the fair value of our loans change based on market
conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different
and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Partially Owned
Entities

As of December 31,
2011 and 2010, the carrying amounts of investments in partially owned entities,
including Toys “R” Us, was $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. In
determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity
and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider
factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management
representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive
participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a
variable interest entity in which we have the power over significant activities
of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could
potentially be significant to the entity. We account for investments on the
equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met and we have
significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method
investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our
share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions each
period. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method
accounting are accounted for on the cost method.

Investments in
partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
 An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount
of an investment over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are
based on current plans, intended holding periods and available information at
the time the analyses are prepared.  The ultimate realization of our
investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors,
including the performance of each investment and market conditions.  If our
estimates of the projected future cash flows, the nature of development
activities for properties for which such activities are planned and the
estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or
otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such
differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. 
The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on
assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements
that could differ materially from actual results.


Critical Accounting Policies – continued

Allowance For Doubtful Accounts

We periodically evaluate the collectability of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts ($43,241,000 and $62,979,000 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents ($4,046,000 and $7,316,000 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively). This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:

·

Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.  We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use.  In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

·

Percentage Rent — income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon tenant sales exceeding defined thresholds. These rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., when tenant sales thresholds have been achieved).

·

Hotel Revenue — income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered.

·

Trade Shows Revenue — income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred.

·

Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.

·

Management, Leasing and Other Fees — income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.

·

Cleveland Medical Mart — revenue arising from the development of the Cleveland Medical Mart.  This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements using the criteria set forth in ASC 605-25,

Multiple Element Arrangements

, as we are providing development, marketing, leasing, and other property management services.

Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among other things, its collectibility. If our assessment of the collectibility of revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material.

Income Taxes

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, or fail to meet other REIT requirements, we may fail to qualify as a REIT which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences.

Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Years Ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 - continued

Notes to preceding tabular information:

(1)   EBITDA represents “Earnings Before
Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.”  We consider EBITDA a
supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered
performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as
opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based
on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize these measures to make investment decisions
as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA
should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)   Interest and debt expense, depreciation
and amortization and income tax (benefit) expense in the reconciliation of our
net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these items from partially
owned entities.

(3)   The tables below provide information
about EBITDA from certain investments that are included in the “other” column of
the preceding EBITDA by segment reconciliations.  The totals for each of
the columns below agree to the total EBITDA for the “other “ column in the
preceding EBITDA by segment reconciliations.

Income (loss) from Real Estate Fund

In the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized $22,886,000 of income from the Fund, including $11,995,000 of net unrealized gains from the mark-to-market of investments and $5,391,000 of net realized gains from the disposition of two investments.  Of the $22,886,000, $13,598,000 was attributable to noncontrolling interests.  Accordingly, our share of the Fund’s income was $9,288,000.  In addition, we recognized $2,695,000 of management, leasing and development fees which are included as a component of “fee and other income,” and incurred $3,451,000 of placement fees in connection with the February 2011 closing of the Fund, which is included in “general and administrative” expenses.

positions in marketable equity securities, interest income on mezzanine loans
receivable, other interest income and dividend income) was $148,826,000 in the
year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $235,315,000 in the prior year, a
decrease of $86,489,000. This decrease resulted from:

$560,052,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $16,037,000.  This decrease
was primarily due to savings of (i) $22,865,000 applicable to the repurchase and
retirement of convertible senior debentures and repayment of senior unsecured
notes, (ii) $18,157,000 from the repayment of the Springfield Mall mortgage at a
discount in December 2010 and (iii) $14,856,000 from the deconsolidation of the
Warner Building resulting from the sale of a 45% interest in October 2010,

cross-collateralized debt secured by 40 of our strip shopping centers in August
2010, (v) $14,777,000 from the financing of 2121 Crystal Drive and Two Penn
Plaza in the first quarter of 2011, (vi) $5,057,000 from the issuance of

the consolidation of the San Jose Shopping Center resulting from the October
2010 acquisition of the 55% interest we did not previously own.

Net Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt

In the year ended
December 31, 2010, we recognized a $94,789,000 net gain on the extinguishment of
debt (primarily from our acquisition of the mortgage loan secured by the
Springfield Mall).

Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially
Owned Assets

In the year ended
December 31, 2011, we recognized a $15,134,000 net gain on disposition of wholly
owned and partially owned assets (primarily from the sale of residential
condominiums and marketable securities), compared to a $81,432,000 net gain in
the prior year (primarily from the sale of a 45% interest in the Warner Building
and sales of marketable securities).

Redemptions

In the year ended
December 31, 2011, we recognized a $5,000,000 discount from the redemption of
1,000,000 Series D-11 preferred units with a par value of $25.00 per unit, for
an aggregate of $20,000,000 in cash, compared to a $4,382,000 discount in the

Same Store EBITDA

Same store EBITDA
represents EBITDA from property level operations which are owned by us in both
the current and prior year reporting periods.  Same store EBITDA excludes
segment-level overhead expenses, which are expenses that we do not consider to
be property-level expenses, as well as other non-operating items.  We
present same store EBITDA on both a GAAP basis and a cash basis, which excludes
income from the straight-lining of rents, amortization of below-market leases,
net of above-market leases and other non-cash adjustments. We present these
non-GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational
performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to
buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our
properties and segments to those of our peers.  Same store EBITDA should
not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations
and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other
companies.

Below are the same
store EBITDA results on a GAAP and cash basis for each of our segments for the

(4)

On March 31,
      2009, our nine most senior executives voluntarily surrendered their 2007
      and 2008 stock option awards and their 2008 out-performance plan awards.
      Accordingly, we recognized $32,588 of expense in the first quarter of
      2009, representing the unamortized portion of these
  awards.

(5)

This decrease in
      expense is entirely offset by a corresponding decrease in income from the
      mark-to-market of the deferred compensation plan assets, a component of
      “interest and other investment income (loss), net” on our consolidated
      statement of income.

from the acquisition, retirement and repayment of an aggregate of $2.1 billion
of our convertible senior debentures and senior unsecured notes in 2009 and (ii)
$30,639,000 from the repayment of $400,000,000 of cross-collateralized debt

Supplemental Information – continued

Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 - continued

Notes to preceding tabular information:

(1)   EBITDA represents “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.”  We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize their measures to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)   Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax expense in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these items from partially owned entities.

Same Store EBITDA

Same store EBITDA represents EBITDA from property level operations which are owned by us in both the current and prior year reporting periods.  Same store EBITDA excludes segment-level overhead expenses, which are expenses that we do not consider to be property-level expenses, as well as other non-operating items.  We present same store EBITDA on both a GAAP basis and a cash basis, which excludes income from the straight-lining of rents, amortization of below-market leases, net of above-market leases and other non-cash adjustments. We present these non-GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers.  Same store EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Below are the same store EBITDA results on a GAAP and cash basis for each of our segments for the three months ended December 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010.

Three Months Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to September 30, 2011

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the current quarter to the previous quarter. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys’ fourth quarter net income, which we record on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of Toys’ fiscal year net income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. The Merchandise Mart segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage and specialty rental income.

Related Party Transactions

Alexander’s

We own 32.4% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President and Chief Executive Officer, are officers and directors of Alexander’s.  We provide various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements.  These agreements are described in Note 5 - Investments in Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Interstate Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr. Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s, are Interstate’s two other partners. As of December 31, 2011, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 6.3% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 27.2% of Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term. We believe based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies, that the management agreement terms are fair to us.

Other

Upon maturity on December 23, 2011, Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board of Trustees, repaid the Company his $13,122,500 outstanding loan.  Pursuant to a credit agreement dated November 1999, Mr. Roth may draw up to $15,000,000 of loans from the Company on a revolving basis.  Each loan bears interest, payable quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the loan is made and matures on the sixth anniversary of such loan.  Loans are collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the amount outstanding.  On December 23, 2011, Mr. Roth borrowed $13,122,500 under this facility, which bears interest at 1.27% per annum and matures on December 23, 2017.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Property rental income is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties.  Other sources of liquidity to fund cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, and our revolving credit facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity; and asset sales.  Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, as well as acquisition and development costs.

We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures.  Capital requirements for development expenditures and acquisitions (excluding Fund acquisitions) may require funding from borrowings and/or equity offerings.  In addition, the Fund has aggregate unfunded equity commitments of $416,600,000 for acquisitions, including $104,150,000 from us.

Dividends

Our dividend policy, if continued for all of 2012, would require us to pay out approximately $510,000,000 of cash for common share dividends.  In addition, during 2012, we expect to pay approximately $71,000,000 of cash dividends on outstanding preferred shares and approximately $49,000,000 of cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations

We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a “well-known seasoned issuer.”  Our revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB.  Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.  As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants required by our revolving credit facilities.

As of December 31, 2011, we had $606,553,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $2,339,915,000 of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, net of outstanding borrowings of $138,000,000 and letters of credit of $22,085,000.

Interest on variable rate debt is computed using rates in effect at December 31, 2011.

Details of 2011 financing activities are provided in the “Overview” of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.  Details of 2010 financing activities are discussed below.

In March 2010, we completed a public offering of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due April 1, 2015 and retained net proceeds of approximately $496,000,000.  The notes were sold at 99.834% of their face amount to yield 4.287%.  The notes can be redeemed without penalty beginning January 1, 2015.

In August 2010, we sold $660,000,000 of 10-year mortgage notes in a single issuer securitization.  The notes are comprised of a $600,000,000 fixed rate component and a $60,000,000 variable rate component and are cross-collateralized by 40 of our strip shopping centers.  The $600,000,000 fixed rate portion bears interest at an initial rate of 4.18% and a weighted average rate of 4.31% over the 10-year term and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule.  The variable rate portion bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.36%, with a 1% floor.

In December 2010, we acquired the mortgage loan secured by the Springfield Mall, located in Fairfax County, Virginia for $115,000,000 in cash.  The loan had an outstanding balance of $171,500,000.  In a separate transaction, we acquired the prior owner’s interest in the partnership that owns the mall in exchange for $25,000,000 in Operating Partnership units.  These transactions resulted in a $102,932,000 net gain on early extinguishment of debt.

In 2010, through open market repurchases and tender offers, we purchased $270,491,000 aggregate face amount ($264,476,000 aggregate carrying amount) of our convertible senior debentures and $17,000,000 aggregate face amount ($16,981,000 aggregate carrying amount) of our senior unsecured notes for $274,857,000 and $17,382,000 in cash, respectively, resulting in a net loss of $10,381,000 and $401,000, respectively.

Acquisitions and Investments

Details of 2011 acquisitions and investments are provided in the “Overview” of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.  Details of 2010 acquisitions and investments are discussed below.

Investment in LNR Property Corporation (“LNR”)

On July 29, 2010, as a part of LNR’s recapitalization, we acquired a 26.2% equity interest in LNR for $116,000,000 in cash and conversion into equity of our $15,000,000 mezzanine loan (the then current carrying amount) made to LNR’s parent, Riley Holdco Corp.  The recapitalization involved an infusion of a total of $417,000,000 in new cash equity and the reduction of LNR’s total debt to $425,000,000 from $1.3 billion, excluding liabilities related to the consolidated CMBS and CDO trusts described below.  We account for our equity interest in LNR under the equity method on a one-quarter lag basis.  LNR consolidates certain commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) and Collateralized Debt Obligation (“CDO”) trusts for which it is the primary beneficiary.  The assets of these trusts (primarily commercial mortgage loans), which aggregate approximately $142 billion as of September 30, 2010, are the sole source of repayment of the related liabilities, which are non-recourse to LNR and its equity holders, including us.  Changes in the fair value of these assets each period are offset by changes in the fair value of the related liabilities through LNR’s consolidated income statement.

510 Fifth Avenue

On October 8, 2010, we acquired 510 Fifth Avenue, a 59,000 square foot retail property located at 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue in New York, for $57,000,000, comprised of $24,700,000 in cash and $32,300,000 of existing debt.  We consolidate the accounts of this property into our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition.

San Jose, California

On October 15, 2010, we acquired the 55% interest that we did not already own of a 646,000 square foot retail property located in San Jose, California, for $97,000,000, consisting of $27,000,000 in cash and $70,000,000 of existing debt.  We consolidate the accounts of the property into our consolidated financial statements from the date of this acquisition.

Atlantic City, New Jersey

On November 4, 2010, we acquired 11.3 acres of the land under a portion of the Borgata Hotel and Casino complex for $83,000,000 in cash.  The land is leased to the partnership that controls the Borgata Hotel and Casino complex through December 2070.

Investment in J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (“J.C. Penney”) (NYSE: JCP)

We own 23,400,000 J.C. Penney common shares, or 11.0% of J.C. Penney’s outstanding common shares.  Of these shares, 4,815,990 are owned through a forward contract executed on October 7, 2010, at a weighted average strike price of $28.80 per share, or $138,682,000 in the aggregate.  The contract may be settled, at our election, in cash or common shares, in whole or in part, at any time prior to October 9, 2012.  The counterparty may accelerate settlement, in whole or in part, upon one year’s notice to us.

Development and Redevelopment Expenditures

We expended $25,100,000 in 2011 to complete development projects in progress.  We are evaluating various development and redevelopment opportunities which we estimate could require as much as $1.5 billion to be expended over the next five years. These opportunities include:

·

demolition of a 372,000 square foot office building in Crystal City, to construct a 700,000 square foot office building;

·

renovation of the Hotel Pennsylvania;

·

construction of a luxury residential condominium at 220 Central Park South, adjacent to Central Park;

·

re-tenanting and repositioning of 330 West 34

th

Street;

·

re-tenanting and repositioning of 280 Park Avenue;

·

complete renovation of the 1.4 million square foot Springfield Mall; and

·

re-tenanting and repositioning a number of our strip shopping centers.

We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in Manhattan, Rosslyn, Pentagon City and Crystal City, for which plans, budgeted costs and financings have yet to be determined.

There can be no assurance that any of our development projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed on schedule or within budget.

Insurance

We maintain general
liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all risk
property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence,
including coverage for terrorist acts, with sub-limits for certain perils such
as floods.  Our California properties have earthquake insurance with
coverage of $180,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount
of 5% of the value of the affected property, up to a $180,000,000 annual
aggregate.

Penn Plaza Insurance
Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a
re-insurer with respect to all risk property and rental value insurance and a
portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for
coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and
radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program
Reauthorization Act. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is
fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government
with no exposure to PPIC.  Coverage for NBCR losses is up to $2.0 billion
per occurrence, for which PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and
15% of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible
for the remaining 85% of a covered loss.  We are ultimately responsible for
any loss borne by PPIC.

We continue to monitor
the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts
of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be
available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.

Our debt instruments,
consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to
us, senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior
debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring
us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance
coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an
equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if
lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely
affect our ability to finance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and
Contingencies

Our mortgage loans are
non-recourse to us.  However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees
or master leased tenant space.  These guarantees and master leases
terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment
of the underlying loans.  As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate dollar
amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately
$283,625,000.

At December 31, 2011,
$22,085,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our revolving
credit facilities.  Our credit facilities contain financial covenants that
require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market
capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a
decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain
customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and
warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to
accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or
principal.

Each of our properties
has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various
times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental
contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new
areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination,
the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not
result in significant costs to us.

We expect to fund
additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating
approximately $288,799,000.

Litigation

We are from time to
time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In
our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters,
including the matter referred to below, is not expected to have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

In 2003, Stop &
Shop filed an action against us in the New York Supreme Court, claiming that we
had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect $5,000,000 of
annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to a Master Agreement and
Guaranty, because of the expiration of the leases to which the annual rent was
previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that an order of the Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York, as modified on appeal by the
District Court, froze our right to reallocate and effectively terminated our
right to collect the annual rent from Stop & Shop.  We asserted a
counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid annual rent accruing through
the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to
be liable for the annual rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master
Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect.   After summary judgment
motions by both sides were denied, the parties conducted discovery.  A
trial was held in November 2010.  On November 7, 2011, the Court determined
that we have a continuing right to allocate the annual rent to unexpired leases
covered by the Master Agreement and Guaranty, and directed entry of a judgment
in our favor ordering Stop & Shop to pay us the unpaid annual rent accrued
through February 28, 2011 in the amount of $37,422,000, a portion of the annual
rent due from March 1, 2011 through the date of judgment, interest, and
attorneys’ fees.  On December 16, 2011, a money judgment based on the
Court’s decision was entered in our favor in the amount of $56,597,000
(including interest and costs).  The amount for attorneys’ fees is being
addressed in a proceeding before a special referee.  Stop & Shop has
appealed the Court’s decision and the judgment, and has posted a bond to secure
payment of the judgment.  On January 12, 2012, we commenced a new action
against Stop & Shop seeking recovery of $2,500,000 of annual rent not
included in the money judgment, plus additional annual rent as it accrues.

As of December 31,
2011, we have a $41,983,000 receivable from Stop and Shop, excluding amounts due
to us for interest and costs resulting from the Court’s judgment.  In the
fourth quarter of 2011, based on the Court’s decision, we recognized $23,521,000
of income, representing the portion of the $41,983,000 receivable that was
previously reserved.  As a result of Stop & Shop’s appeal, we believe,
after consultation with counsel, that the maximum reasonably possible loss is up
to the total amount of the receivable of $41,983,000.

Funds From Operations (“FFO”)

FFO is computed in
accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National
Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”).  In the fourth
quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, NAREIT issued updated guidance on
FFO and modified its definition of FFO to specifically exclude real estate
impairment losses, including the prorata share of such losses of unconsolidated
subsidiaries.  To the extent applicable, NAREIT requested companies to
restate prior period FFO to conform to the new definition.  Accordingly, we
have restated our quarter and year ended December 31, 2010 FFO to exclude real
estate impairment losses aggregating $103,981,000 and $108,981,000,
respectively.  NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to
exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets, real estate
impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate
assets, extraordinary items and other specified non-cash items, including the
pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries.  FFO and
FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and analysts to
facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and
among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and
amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and
implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over
time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions.  FFO
does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not
necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should
not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or
cash flows as a liquidity measure.  FFO may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures employed by other companies.

FFO attributable to
common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $1,230,973,000, or $6.42 per
diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $1,251,533,000,
or $6.59 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2010. FFO
attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $280,369,000,
or $1.46 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2011,
compared to $432,860,000, or $2.27 per diluted share for the three months ended
December 31, 2010.  Details of certain items that affect comparability are
discussed in the financial results summary of our “Overview.”

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We have exposure to
fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are sensitive to
many factors that are beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest
rates on our consolidated and non-consolidated debt (all of which arises out of
non-trading activity) is as follows:

      of LNR's liabilities related to consolidated CMBS and CDO trusts which are
      non-recourse to LNR and its equity holders, including us.

We may utilize various
financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on
our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our
analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such
strategies. As of December 31, 2011, variable rate debt with an aggregate
principal amount of $443,353,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.40%
was subject to LIBOR caps.  These caps are based on a notional amount of
$443,353,000 and cap LIBOR at a weighted average rate of 5.58%.  In
addition, we have one interest rate swap on a $425,000,000 loan that swapped the
rate from LIBOR plus 2.00% (2.30% at December 31, 2011) to a fixed rate of 5.13%
for the remaining seven-year term of the loan.

As of December 31,
2011, we have investments in mezzanine loans at variable interest rates with an
aggregate carrying amount of $54,724,000 and a weighted average rate of 10.42%,
which partially mitigates our exposure to a change in interest rates on our
variable rate debt.

Fair Value of Debt

The estimated fair
value of our consolidated debt is calculated based on current market prices and
discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made
to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such
debt.  As of December 31, 2011, the estimated fair value of our
consolidated debt was $10,770,227,000.

Derivative Instruments

We have, and may in
the future enter into, derivative positions that do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment, including our economic interest in J.C. Penney common
shares.  Because these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment, the gains or losses resulting from their mark-to-market at the end of
each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in “interest and
other investment income (loss), net” on our consolidated statements of income.
In addition, we are, and may in the future be, subject to additional expense
based on the notional amount of the derivative positions and a specified spread
over LIBOR. Because the market value of these instruments can vary significantly
between periods, we may experience significant fluctuations in the amount of our
investment income or expense in any given period. During the years ended
December 31, 2011 and 2010, we recognized income from derivative instruments of
$12,984,000 and $130,153,000, respectively.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board of Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vornado Realty Trust (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Vornado Realty Trust at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of presenting comprehensive income in 2011 due to the adoption of FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05,

Presentation of Comprehensive Income

.  The change in presentation has been applied retrospectively to all periods presented.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vornado and the Operating Partnership. All significant inter-company amounts have been eliminated. We account for unconsolidated partially owned entities on the equity method of accounting.  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Literature

In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Update No. 2011-04,

Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS

(“ASU No. 2011-04”).  ASU No. 2011-04 provides a uniform framework for fair value measurements and related disclosures between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and requires additional disclosures, including: (i) quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, a description of the valuation processes used, and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs, for Level 3 fair value measurements; (ii) fair value of financial instruments not measured at fair value but for which disclosure of fair value is required, based on their levels in the fair value hierarchy; and (iii) transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  ASU No. 2011-04 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011.  The adoption of this update on January 1, 2012 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2011, the FASB issued Update No. 2011-05,

Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income

(“ASU No. 2011-05”).  ASU No. 2011-05 requires the presentation of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements.  ASU No. 2011-05 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.  The Company early adopted this guidance as of December 31, 2011, and has presented the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as a separate financial statement.

In September 2011, the FASB issued Update No. 2011-09,

Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Disclosures About an Employer’s Participation in a Multiemployer Plan

(“ASU No. 2011-09”).  ASU No. 2011-09 requires enhanced disclosures about an entity’s participation in multiemployer plans that offer pension and other postretirement benefits.  ASU No. 2011-09 became effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after December 15, 2011.  The adoption of this update on December 31, 2011 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Significant Accounting Policies

Real Estate:

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly related to the improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete. If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the undepreciated net book value of the property carried forward, exceeds the estimated fair value of redeveloped property, the excess is charged to expense. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40 years. Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximate the useful lives of the assets. Additions to real estate include interest expense capitalized during construction of $1,197,000 and $864,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Upon the acquisition
of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land,
buildings and improvements, identified intangibles, such as acquired above and
below-market leases and acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and
acquired liabilities and we allocate the purchase price based on these
assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that
utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market
information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of
factors including historical operating results, known trends, and
market/economic conditions.

Our properties,
including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying
amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the
anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis.  An impairment loss is
measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying amount over its
estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on our current plans,
intended holding periods and available market information at the time the
analyses are prepared.  If our estimates of the projected future cash
flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change, our evaluation
of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to
our consolidated financial statements.  The evaluation of anticipated cash
flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future
occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially
from actual results.  Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease
the likelihood of recording impairment losses.  The table below summarizes
tenant buy-outs, impairment losses and other acquisition related costs incurred
in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Partially Owned
Entities:

In determining whether we have a controlling
interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the
accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board
representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and
contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well
as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we have power over
significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or
receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity. We have
concluded that we do not control a partially owned entity if the entity is not
considered a variable interest entity and the approval of all of the
partners/members is contractually required with respect to major decisions, such
as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange or other disposition of
real property, the hiring of a chief executive officer, the commencement,
compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or arbitration or the
placement of new or additional financing secured by assets of the venture. 
We account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for
consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the operations
of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and
subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions
and distributions each period. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation
or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method. 
Investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying
amount of an investment over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses
are based on current plans, intended holding periods and available information
at the time the analyses are prepared.  In the years ended December 31,
2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized non-cash impairment losses on investments in
partially owned entities aggregating $13,794,000, $11,481,000 and $17,820,000,
respectively.

Identified
Intangibles:

We record acquired intangible assets (including acquired
above-market leases, tenant relationships and acquired in-place leases) and
acquired intangible liabilities (including below–market leases) at their
estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. We amortize identified
intangibles that have finite lives over the period they are expected to
contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or
business acquired. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
measured based on the excess of carrying amount of the identified intangible
over its estimated fair value.  As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the
carrying amounts of identified intangible assets were $319,704,000

and
$346,157,000, respectively. The carrying amounts of identified intangible
liabilities, a component of “deferred credit” on our consolidated balance
sheets, were $467,187,000 and $521,372,000, respectively.

Mezzanine Loans
Receivable:

We invest in mezzanine loans of entities that have
significant real estate assets.  These investments, which are subordinate
to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by
pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real
estate.  We record these investments at the stated principal amount net of
any unamortized discount or premium. We accrete or amortize any discount or
premium over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest
method or straight-line method, if the result is not materially different.
 We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of
our loans whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such amounts may
not be recoverable. A loan is impaired when it is probable that we will be
unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms.
When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by
comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the present value of expected
future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or as a
practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral
dependent.  Interest on impaired loans is recognized when received in
cash.  In the year ended December 31, 2009 we recorded a $190,738,000 loss
accrual on our portfolio of mezzanine loans, of which $72,270,000 and
$53,100,000 was reversed in 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less. The majority of
our cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks which may at
times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit.  To date, we
have not experienced any losses on our invested cash.

Restricted Cash:

Restricted cash consists of security deposits,
cash restricted in connection with our deferred compensation plan and cash
escrowed under loan agreements for debt service, real estate taxes, property
insurance and capital improvements.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:

We periodically evaluate the collectibility of
amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required
payments under the lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for
receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents. This receivable arises
from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease
agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and
considers payment history and current credit status in developing these
estimates.  As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had $43,241,000 and
$62,979,000, respectively, in allowances for doubtful accounts.  In
addition, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had $4,046,000 and $7,316,000,
respectively, in allowances for receivables arising from the straight-lining of
rents.

Deferred Charges:

Direct financing costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related
agreements as a component of interest expense. Direct costs related to
successful leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a straight line
basis over the lives of the related leases. All other deferred charges are
amortized on a straight line basis, which approximates the effective interest
rate method, in accordance with the terms of the agreements to which they
relate.

Stock-Based
Compensation:

Stock-based compensation consists of awards to
certain employees and officers and consists of stock options, restricted stock,
restricted Operating Partnership units and out-performance plan awards.  We
account for all stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC
718,

Compensation – Stock Compensation

Revenue Recognition:

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:

•      Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.  We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use.  In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

•      Percentage Rent — income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon tenant sales exceeding defined thresholds. These rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., when tenant sales thresholds have been achieved).

•      Hotel Revenue — income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue is recognized when the services have been rendered.

•      Trade Shows Revenue — income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred.

•      Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.

•      Management, Leasing and Other Fees — income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.

•      Cleveland Medical Mart — revenue arising from the development of the Cleveland Medical Mart.  This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements using the criteria set forth in ASC 605-25,

Multiple Element Arrangements

, as we are providing development, marketing, leasing, and other property management services.

Condominium Units Held For Sale:

Condominium units held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.  As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, condominiums held for sale, which are included in “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheet, aggregate $60,785,000 and $84,397,000, respectively and consist of substantially completed units at Granite Park in Pasadena, The Bryant in Boston and our 40 East 66

th

Street property in Manhattan.  Revenue from condominium unit sales is recognized upon closing of the sale (the “completed contract method”), as all conditions for full profit recognition have been met at that time.  We use the relative sales value method to allocate costs to individual condominium units.  Net gains on sales of condominiums units are included in “net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets” on our consolidated statements of income.  In the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recognized non-cash impairment losses related to certain of these condominiums aggregating $30,013,000 and $13,667,000, respectively, based on our assessments of the expected net sales proceeds associated with these condominium projects.  These losses are included in “tenant buy-outs, impairment losses and other acquisition related costs” on our consolidated statements of income.

Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities:

ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, as amended,
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, our derivative instruments
consisted primarily of a portion of our investment in J.C. Penney common shares
(see Note 4 – Marketable Securities and Derivative Instruments) and interest
rate swaps.  We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the
intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used
to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or
firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk,
are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted
transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

For derivatives
designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and
the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in
the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive
income (loss) (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings
when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective portion of
changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings.
We assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the
changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with
the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or
transaction. For derivatives not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are
recognized in earnings.

Income Per
Share:

Basic income per share is computed based on
weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted income per share considers the
effect of all potentially dilutive share equivalents, including outstanding
employee stock options, restricted shares and convertible or redeemable
securities.

Income
Taxes:

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue
to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856‑860 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of
its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which
meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable
income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to shareholders
100% of taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is
required.  Dividends distributed for the year ended December 31, 2011, were
characterized, for federal income tax income tax purposes, as 93.2% ordinary
income and 6.8% as long term capital gain.  Dividend distributions for the
year ended December 31, 2010, were characterized, for Federal income tax
purposes, as 95.9% ordinary income, 2.8% long-term capital gain and 1.3% return
of capital.  Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2009
were characterized, for Federal income tax purposes, as 63.9% ordinary income,
0.9% long-term capital gain and 35.2% return of capital.

We have elected to
treat certain consolidated subsidiaries, and may in the future elect to treat
newly formed subsidiaries, as taxable REIT subsidiaries pursuant to an amendment
to the Internal Revenue Code that became effective January 1, 2001. 
Taxable REIT subsidiaries may participate in non-real estate related activities
and/or perform non-customary services for tenants and are subject to Federal and
State income tax at regular corporate tax rates. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries
had a combined current income tax liability of approximately $26,645,000 and
$24,858,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and have immaterial
differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and

Estate Fund (the “Fund”)

In
February 2011, the Fund’s subscription period closed with an aggregate of
$800,000,000 of capital commitments, of which we committed $200,000,000. 
We are the general partner and investment manager of the Fund, which has an
eight-year term and a three-year investment period.

During the
investment period, which concludes in July 2013, the Fund is our exclusive
investment vehicle for all investments that fit within its investment
parameters, including debt, equity and other interests in real estate, and
excluding (i) investments in vacant land and ground-up development; (ii)
investments acquired by merger or primarily for our securities or properties;
(iii) properties which can be combined with or relate to our existing
properties; (iv) securities of commercial mortgage loan servicers and
investments derived from any such investments; (v) non-controlling interests in
equity and debt securities; and (vi) investments located outside of North
America.

The Fund is accounted for under the AICPA
Investment Company Guide and its investments are reported on its balance sheet
at fair value, with changes in value each period recognized in earnings. 
We consolidate the accounts of the Fund into our consolidated financial
statements, retaining the fair value basis of accounting.

During
2011, the Fund made three investments (described below) aggregating $248,500,000
and exited two investments.  As of December 31, 2011, the Fund has five
investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $346,650,000, or
$11,995,000 in excess of cost, and has remaining unfunded commitments of
$416,600,000, of which our share is $104,150,000.

One Park Avenue

On March 1, 2011, the Fund as a co-investor (64.7%
interest), together with Vornado (30.3% interest), acquired a 95% interest in
One Park Avenue, a 932,000 square foot office building located between

nd

and 33

rd

Streets in New York, for $374,000,000. 
The purchase price consisted of $137,000,000 in cash and 95% of a $250,000,000
five-year mortgage that bears interest at 5.0%.  The Fund accounts for its
64.7% interest in the property at fair value in accordance with the AICPA Audit
and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies.  We account for our directly
owned 30.3% equity interest under the equity method of accounting.

Crowne Plaza Times Square

On December 16, 2011,
the Fund formed a joint venture with the owner of the property to recapitalize
the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Times Square.  The property is located at 48th
Street and Broadway in Times Square and is comprised of a 795-key hotel, 14,000
square feet of prime retail space, 212,000 square feet of office space, nine
large signage offerings, a 159-space parking garage and a health club.  The
joint venture plans to reconfigure and reposition the retail and office space as
well as add additional signage.  Vornado will manage and lease the
commercial components of the property and the joint venture partner will asset
manage the hotel.  This transaction was initiated by us in May 2011, when
the Fund acquired a $34,000,000 mezzanine position in the junior most tranche of
the property’s mezzanine debt.  In December 2011, the Fund contributed
$31,000,000 and its partner contributed $22,000,000 of new capital to pay down
third party debt and for future capital expenditures.  The new capital was
contributed in the form of debt that is convertible into preferred equity that
receives a priority return and then will receive a profit participation. 
The Fund has an economic interest of approximately 38% in the property. 
The Fund’s investment is subordinate to the property’s $259,000,000 of senior
debt which matures in December 2013, with a one-year extension
option.

11 East 68

$50,500,000.  The retail portion of the property consists of two retail
units aggregating 5,000 square feet. The Fund provided $21,200,000 at closing
and will provide the remaining $29,300,000 over the next two years.  In
addition, the Fund has also provided a $21,000,000 mezzanine loan on the
residential portion of the property, which bears paid-in-kind interest at 15%,
matures in three years and has a one-year extension option.

4.    Marketable Securities and Derivative
Instruments

Marketable Securities

Our portfolio of
marketable securities is comprised of debt and equity securities that are
classified as available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale securities are
presented on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value.  Gains and
losses resulting from the mark-to-market of these securities are included in
“other comprehensive income (loss).”  Gains and losses are recognized in
earnings only upon the sale of the securities and are recorded based on the
weighted average cost of such securities.

We evaluate our
portfolio of marketable securities for impairment each reporting period. 
For each of the securities in our portfolio with unrealized losses, we review
the underlying cause of the decline in value and the estimated recovery period,
as well as the severity and duration of the decline.  In our evaluation, we
consider our ability and intent to hold these investments for a reasonable
period of time sufficient for us to recover our cost basis.  We also
evaluate the near-term prospects for each of these investments in relation to
the severity and duration of the decline.  In 2009, we concluded that
certain of our investments in marketable securities were
“other-than-temporarily” impaired and recognized a $3,361,000 impairment
loss.  This loss is included as a component of “interest and other
investment income (loss), net” on our consolidated statement of income. 
Our conclusion was based on the severity and duration of the decline in the
market value of the securities and our inability to forecast a recovery in the
near term.  No impairment losses were recognized in the years ended
December 31, 2011 and 2010.  During 2011, 2010 and 2009 we sold certain
marketable securities for aggregate proceeds of $69,559,000, $281,486,000, and
$64,355,000, respectively resulting in net gains of $5,020,000, $22,604,000, and
$3,834,000, respectively, which are included as a component of “net gain on
disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets” on our consolidated
statements of income.

Investment in J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (“J.C. Penney”) (NYSE: JCP)

We own 23,400,000 J.C. Penney common shares, or 11.0% of its outstanding common shares.  Below are the details of our investment.

We own 18,584,010 common shares at an average economic cost of $25.75 per share or $478,532,000 in the aggregate.  As of December 31, 2011, these shares have an aggregate fair value of $653,228,000, based on J.C. Penney’s closing share price of $35.15 per share at December 31, 2011.  Of these shares, 15,500,000 were acquired through the exercise of a call option that was acquired on September 28, 2010 and settled on November 9, 2010.  During the period in which the call option was outstanding and classified as a derivative instrument, we recognized $112,537,000 of income.  Upon exercise of the call option, the GAAP basis of the 18,584,010 common shares we own increased to $31.81 per share, or $591,069,000 in the aggregate.  These shares are included in marketable equity securities on our consolidated balance sheet and are classified as “available-for-sale.”  In the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized a $51,925,000 gain from the mark-to-market of these shares, which is included in “other comprehensive income (loss),” based on the difference between the carrying amount of these shares of $601,303,000 at December 31, 2010 and the fair value of $653,228,000 at December 31, 2011.

We also own an economic interest in 4,815,990 J.C. Penney common shares through a forward contract executed on October 7, 2010, at a weighted average strike price of $28.80 per share, or $138,682,000 in the aggregate.  The contract may be settled, at our election, in cash or common shares, in whole or in part, at any time prior to October 9, 2012.  The counterparty may accelerate settlement, in whole or in part, upon one year’s notice to us.  The contract is a derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  Mark-to-market adjustments on the underlying common shares are recognized in “interest and other investment income (loss), net” on our consolidated statements of income.  In the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we recognized gains of $12,984,000 and $17,616,000, respectively, from the mark-to-market of the underlying common shares, based on J.C. Penney’s closing share price of $35.15 per share and $32.31 per share at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

On September 16, 2011, we entered into an agreement with J.C. Penney which enables us to increase our beneficial and/or economic ownership to up to 15.4% of J.C. Penney’s outstanding common shares.  We have agreed to vote any common shares we hold in excess of 9.9% of J.C. Penney’s outstanding common shares in accordance with either the recommendation of the board of directors of J.C. Penney or in direct proportion to the vote of all other public shareholders of J.C. Penney (excluding shares affiliated with Pershing Square Capital Management L.P.).

We review our investment in J.C. Penney on a continuing basis.  Depending on various factors, including, without limitation, J.C. Penney’s financial position and strategic direction, actions taken by its board, price levels of its common shares, other investment opportunities available to us, market conditions and general economic and industry conditions, we may take such actions with respect to J.C. Penney as we deem appropriate, including (i) purchasing additional common shares or other financial instruments related to J.C. Penney, subject to our agreement with J.C. Penney as described in the preceding paragraph, or (ii) selling some or all of our beneficial or economic holdings, or (iii) engaging in hedging or similar transactions.

Toys “R” Us (“Toys”)

As of December 31, 2011, we own 32.7% of Toys.  The business of Toys is highly seasonal.  Historically, Toys’ fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income.  We account for our investment in Toys under the equity method and record our 32.7% share of Toys net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because Toys’ fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, and our fiscal year ends on December 31.  As of December 31, 2011, the carrying amount of our investment in Toys does not differ materially from our share of the equity in the net assets of Toys on a purchase accounting basis.

On May 28, 2010, Toys filed a registration statement, as amended, with the SEC for the offering and sale of its common stock.  The offering, if completed, would result in a reduction of our percentage ownership of Toys’ equity.  The size of the offering and its completion are subject to market and other conditions.

In August 2010, in connection with certain financing and refinancing transactions, Toys paid us an aggregate of $9,600,000 for our share of advisory fees.  Since Toys has capitalized these fees and are amortizing them over the term of the related debt, we recorded the fees as a reduction of the basis of our investment in Toys and will amortize the fees into income over the term of the related debt.

Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”) (NYSE: ALX)

As of December 31, 2011, we own 1,654,068 Alexander’s commons shares, or approximately 32.4% of Alexander’s common equity.  We manage, lease and develop Alexander’s properties pursuant to the agreements described below which expire in March of each year and are automatically renewable.

As of December 31, 2011 the market value (“fair value” pursuant to ASC 820) of our investment in Alexander’s, based on Alexander’s 2011 closing share price of $370.03, was $612,055,000, or $422,280,000 in excess of the carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet.  As of December 31, 2011, the carrying amount of our investment in Alexander’s, excluding amounts owed to us, exceeds our share of the equity in the net assets of Alexander’s by approximately $59,010,000.

The majority of this basis difference resulted from the excess of our purchase price for the Alexander’s common stock acquired over the book value of Alexander’s net assets.  Substantially all of this basis difference was allocated, based on our estimates of the fair values of Alexander’s assets and liabilities, to real estate (land and buildings).  We are amortizing the basis difference related to the buildings into earnings as additional depreciation expense over their estimated useful lives.  This depreciation is not material to our share of equity in Alexander’s net income.  The basis difference related to the land will be recognized upon disposition of our investment.

Management and Development Agreements

We receive an annual fee for managing Alexander’s and all of its properties equal to the sum of (i) $3,000,000, (ii) 3% of the gross income from the Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center, (iii) 2% of the gross income from the Rego Park II Shopping Center, (iv) $0.50 per square foot of the tenant-occupied office and retail space at 731 Lexington Avenue, and (v) $256,000, escalating at 3% per annum, for managing the common area of 731 Lexington Avenue.

In addition, we are entitled to a development fee of 6% of development costs, as defined, with a minimum guaranteed payment of $750,000 per annum.  During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recognized $730,000, $711,000 and $2,710,000, respectively, of development fee income.

Leasing Agreements

We provide Alexander’s with leasing services for a fee of 3% of rent for the first ten years of a lease term, 2% of rent for the eleventh through twentieth year of a lease term and 1% of rent for the twenty-first through thirtieth year of a lease term, subject to the payment of rents by Alexander’s tenants.  In the event third-party real estate brokers are used, our fee increases by 1% and we are responsible for the fees to the third-parties.  We are also entitled to a commission upon the sale of any of Alexander’s assets equal to 3% of gross proceeds, as defined, for asset sales less than $50,000,000, or 1% of gross proceeds, as defined, for asset sales of $50,000,000 or more.  The total of these amounts is payable to us in annual installments in an amount not to exceed $4,000,000 with interest on the unpaid balance at one-year LIBOR plus 1.0% (1.78% at December 31, 2011).

Other Agreements

Building Maintenance Services (“BMS”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, supervises the cleaning, engineering and security services at Alexander’s 731 Lexington Avenue and Kings Plaza properties for an annual fee of the costs for such services plus 6%.  During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized $2,970,000, $2,775,000 and $2,552,000 of income, respectively, under these agreements.

Lexington Realty Trust (“Lexington”) (NYSE: LXP)

As of December 31,

2011, we own 18,468,969 Lexington common shares, or approximately 12.0% of Lexington’s common equity.  We account for our investment in Lexington on the equity method because we believe we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Lexington’s operating and financial policies, based on, among other factors, our

representation on Lexington’s Board of Trustees and the level of our ownership in Lexington as compared to other shareholders.  We record our pro rata share of Lexington’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that Lexington files its financial statements.

Based on Lexington’s December 31, 2011

closing share price of $7.49, the market value (“fair value” pursuant to ASC 820) of our investment in Lexington was $138,333,000, or $80,931,000 in excess of the December 31, 2011 carrying amount on our consolidated balance

sheet.  As of December 31, 2011, the carrying amount of our investment in Lexington was less than our share of the equity in the net assets of Lexington by approximately

$49,200,000

.  This basis difference resulted primarily from $107,882,000 of non-cash impairment charges recognized during 2008, partially offset by purchase accounting for our acquisition of an additional 8,000,000 common shares of Lexington in October 2008, of which the majority relates to our estimate of the fair values of Lexington’s real estate (land and buildings) as compared to the carrying amounts in Lexington’s consolidated financial statements.  The basis difference related to the buildings is being amortized over their estimated useful lives as an adjustment to our equity in net income or loss of Lexington.  This amortization is not material to our share of equity in Lexington’s net income or loss.  The basis difference attributable to the land will be recognized upon disposition of our investment.

LNR Property Corporation (“LNR”)

As of December 31, 2011, we own a 26.2% equity interest in LNR, which we acquired in July 2010.  We account for our investment in LNR under the equity method and record our 26.2% share of LNR’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to receiving LNR’s consolidated financial statements.

LNR consolidates certain commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) and Collateralized Debt Obligation (“CDO”) trusts for which it is the primary beneficiary.  The assets of these trusts (primarily commercial mortgage loans), which aggregate approximately $127 billion as of September 30, 2011, are the sole source of repayment of the related liabilities, which are non-recourse to LNR and its equity holders, including us.  Changes in the fair value of these assets each period are offset by changes in the fair value of the related liabilities through LNR’s consolidated income statement.  As of December 31, 2011, the carrying amount of our investment in LNR does not materially differ from our share of LNR’s equity.

280 Park Avenue Joint Venture

On March 16, 2011, we formed a 50/50 joint venture with SL Green Realty Corp to own the mezzanine debt of 280 Park Avenue, a 1.2 million square foot office building located between 48

th

and 49

th

Streets in Manhattan (the “Property”).  We contributed our mezzanine loan with a face amount of $73,750,000, and they contributed their mezzanine loans with a face amount of $326,250,000 to the joint venture.  We equalized our interest in the joint venture by paying our partner $111,250,000 in cash and assuming $15,000,000 of their debt.  On May 17, 2011, as part of the recapitalization of the Property, the joint venture contributed its debt position for 99% of the common equity of a new joint venture which owns the Property.  The new joint venture’s investment is subordinate to $710,000,000 of third party debt.  The new joint venture expects to spend $150,000,000 for re-tenanting and repositioning the Property.  We account for our 49.5% equity interest in the Property under the equity method of accounting from the date of recapitalization.

Independence Plaza

On June 17, 2011, a joint venture in which we are a 51% partner, invested $55,000,000 in cash (of which we contributed $35,000,000) to acquire a face amount of $150,000,000 of mezzanine loans and a $35,000,000 participation in a senior loan on Independence Plaza, a residential complex comprised of three 39-story buildings in the Tribeca submarket of Manhattan.  We share control over major decisions with our joint venture partner.  We account for our 51% interest in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting from the date of acquisition.

666 Fifth Avenue Office

On December 16, 2011, we formed a joint venture with an affiliate of the Kushner Companies to recapitalize the office portion of 666 Fifth Avenue, a 39-story, 1.4 million square foot Class A office building in Manhattan, located on the full block front of Fifth Avenue between 52nd and 53rd Street.  We acquired a 49.5% interest in the property from the Kushner Companies, the current owner.  In connection therewith, the existing $1,215,000,000 mortgage loan was modified by LNR, the special servicer, into a $1,100,000,000 A-Note and a $115,000,000 B-Note and extended to February 2019; and a portion of the current pay interest was deferred to the B-Note.  We and the Kushner Companies have committed to lend the joint venture an aggregate of $110,000,000 (of which our share is $80,000,000) for tenant improvements and working capital for the property, which is senior to the $115,000,000 B-Note. In addition, we have provided the A-Note holders a limited recourse and cooperation guarantee of up to $75,000,000 if an event of default occurs and is ongoing.  We account for our 49.5% interest in the property under the equity method of accounting from the date of recapitalization.

6.    Mezzanine Loans
Receivable

As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying amount of
mezzanine loans receivable was $133,948,000 and $202,412,000, respectively, net
of allowances of $0 and $73,216,000, respectively.  These loans have a
weighted average interest rate of 9.53% and maturities ranging from August 2014
to May 2016.

In the first quarter of 2011, we recognized $72,270,000
of income, representing the difference between the fair value of our 280 Park
Avenue Mezzanine Loan of $73,750,000, and its carrying amount of
$1,480,000.  The $72,270,000 of income, which is included in “interest and
other investment income (loss), net” on our consolidated statement of income, is
comprised of $63,145,000 from the reversal of the loan loss reserve and
$9,125,000 of previously unrecognized interest income.  Our decision to
reverse the loan loss reserve was based on the increase in value of the
underlying collateral.  On March 16, 2011, we contributed this mezzanine
loan to a 50/50 joint venture with SL Green (see Note 5 – Investments in
Partially Owned Entities).

On March 2, 2011, we sold the Tharaldson Lodging
Companies mezzanine loan, which had a carrying amount of $60,416,000, for
$70,890,000 in cash and recognized a net gain of $10,474,000.  The gain is
included as a component of “interest and other investment income (loss), net” on
our consolidated statement of income.

7.    Discontinued
Operations

In accordance with the provisions of ASC 360,

Property, Plant, and Equipment

, we have reclassified the revenues and expenses of
properties and businesses sold or held for sale to “income (loss) from
discontinued operations” and the related assets and liabilities to “assets
related to discontinued operations” and “liabilities related to discontinued
operations” for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.  The net gains resulting from the sale of the properties below
are included in “income (loss) from discontinued operations” on our consolidated
statements of income.

On January 6, 2012, we completed the sale of 350 West
Mart Center, a 1.2 million square foot office building in Chicago, Illinois, for
$228,000,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $54,200,000 that will be
recognized in the first quarter of 2012.

On March 31, 2011, the receiver completed the disposition
of the High Point Complex in North Carolina.  In connection therewith, the
property and related debt were removed from our consolidated balance sheet and
we recognized a net gain of $83,907,000 on the extinguishment of
debt.

On January 12, 2011, we sold 1140 Connecticut Avenue and
1227 25

th

Street in Washington, DC, for $127,000,000 in cash, which
resulted in a net gain of $45,862,000.

In 2011, we sold three retail properties in separate
transactions for an aggregate of $40,990,000 in cash, which resulted in net
gains of $5,761,000.

In December 2010,
pursuant to a Court judgment, we sold the fee interest in land located in
Arlington County, Virginia,  known as Pentagon Row, to the tenants for an
aggregate of $14,992,000 in cash.

In March 2010, we ceased making debt service payments on
the mortgage loan secured by the Cannery, a retail property in California as a
result of insufficient cash flow, and the loan went into default.  On
October 14, 2010, the special servicer foreclosed on the property, and the
property and related debt were removed from our consolidated balance
sheet.

On September 1, 2009, we sold 1999 K Street, a newly
developed 250,000 square foot office building, in Washington’s Central Business
District, for $207,800,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain of
approximately $41,211,000.

In 2009, we sold 15 retail properties in separate
transactions for an aggregate of $55,000,000 in cash which resulted in net gains
aggregating $4,073,000.

(2)

On January 9, 2012, we completed a $300,000 refinancing of this property. The five-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 3.75% and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the third year. The proceeds of the new loan and $132,000 of existing cash were used to repay the existing loan and closing costs.

(3)

On February 11, 2011, we completed a $425,000 refinancing of this property. The seven-year loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%, which was swapped for the term of the loan to a fixed rate of 5.13%. The loan amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the fourth year. We retained net proceeds of approximately $139,000, after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.

On December 28, 2011, we completed a $330,000 refinancing of this property. The seven-year loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.35% and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the fourth year.

(5)

In February 2012, we notified the lender that this property currently has a 26% vacancy rate, which is expected to increase due to scheduled lease expirations resulting primarily from the Base Realignment and Closure statute. Based on the projected vacancy and the significant amount of capital, time and effort to re-tenant this property, we requested that the mortgage loan be placed with the special servicer.

(6)

On February 10, 2011, we completed a $150,000 financing of this property. The 12-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 5.51% and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the third year. This property was previously unencumbered.

(7)

On May 11, 2011, we repaid the outstanding balance of the variable-rate construction loan on this property and closed on a $101,671 mortgage at a fixed rate of 4.88%. The loan has a 10-year term and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the sixth year.

(8)

On January 18, 2011, we repaid the outstanding balance of the variable-rate construction loan on this property and closed on a $76,100 mortgage at a fixed rate of 4.61%. The loan has a seven-year term and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule.

(9)

On January 10, 2011, we completed a $75,000 financing of this property. The seven-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 4.59% and amortizes based on a 25-year schedule beginning in the sixth year. This property was previously unencumbered.

(10)

On September 1, 2011, we completed a $600,000 refinancing of this property. The 10-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 5.10% and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the fourth year.

(11)

On January 6, 2011, we completed a $60,000 financing of this property. The 10-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 5.14% and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the third year.

(12)

We are currently in negotiations to refinance this loan and have extended its maturity date to March 9, 2012.

(13)

On May 10, 2011, we refinanced this loan for the same amount. The five-year interest only loan is at LIBOR plus 1.25%.

(14)

This loan bears interest at the Freddie Mac Reference Note Rate plus 1.53%.

(15)

This loan has a LIBOR floor of 0.50%.

These notes may be redeemed at our option in whole or in part beginning on October 1, 2014, at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued interest.

(19)

On November 30, 2011, we completed a public offering of $400,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.0%, ten-year senior unsecured notes and retained net proceeds of approximately $395,584. The notes were sold at 99.546% of their face amount to yield 5.057%.

(20)

The net proceeds from the offering of these debentures were contributed to the Operating Partnership in the form of an inter-company loan and the Operating Partnership fully and unconditionally guaranteed payment of these debentures. There are no restrictions which limit the Operating Partnership from making distributions to Vornado and Vornado has virtually no independent assets or operations outside of the Operating Partnership.

(21)

In 2011, we renewed both of our unsecured revolving credit facilities aggregating $2,500,000. The first facility, which was renewed in June 2011, bears interest on drawn amounts at LIBOR plus 1.35% and has a 0.30% facility fee (drawn or undrawn). The second facility, which was renewed in November 2011, bears interest on drawn amounts at LIBOR plus 1.25% and has a 0.25% facility fee (drawn or undrawn). The LIBOR spread and facility fee on both facilities are based on our credit ratings. Both facilities mature in four years and have one-year extension options.

Our convertible senior debentures require that upon conversion, the entire principal amount is to be settled in cash, and at our option, any excess value above the principal amount may be settled in cash or common shares. Based on the December 31, 2011 closing share price of our common shares and the conversion price in the table above, there was no excess value; accordingly, no common shares would be issued if these securities were settled on this date. The number of common shares on which the aggregate consideration that would be delivered upon conversion is 65 common shares.

10.    Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Redeemable noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheets represent Operating Partnership units held by third parties and are comprised of Class A units and Series D-10, D-14, D-15 and D-16 (collectively, “Series D”) cumulative redeemable preferred units.  Class A units may be tendered for redemption to the Operating Partnership for cash; we, at our option, may assume that obligation and pay the holder either cash or Vornado common shares on a one-for-one basis.  Because the number of Vornado common shares outstanding at all times equals the number of Class A units owned by Vornado, the redemption value of each Class A unit is equivalent to the market value of one Vornado common share, and the quarterly distribution to a Class A unitholder is equal to the quarterly dividend paid to a Vornado common shareholder.  Below are the details of Operating Partnership units held by third-parties that are included in “redeemable noncontrolling interests” as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.

On April 20, 2011, we sold 7,000,000 6.875% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at a price of $25.00 per share, in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement.  On April 21, 2011, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 1,050,000 shares to cover over-allotments.  On May 5, 2011 and August 5, 2011 we sold an additional 800,000 and 1,000,000 shares, respectively, at a price of $25.00 per share.  We retained aggregate net proceeds of $238,842,000, after underwriters’ discounts and issuance costs and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 9,850,000 Series J Preferred Units (with economic terms that mirror those of the Series J Preferred Shares).  Dividends on the Series J Preferred Shares are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears.  The Series J Preferred Shares are not convertible into, or exchangeable for, any of our properties or securities.  On or after five years from the date of issuance (or sooner under limited circumstances), we, at our option, may redeem the Series J Preferred Shares at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the date of redemption.  The Series J Preferred Shares have no maturity date and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless redeemed by us.

12.  Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820,

Fair
Value Measurement and Disclosures

defines fair value and establishes a framework
for measuring fair value.  The objective of fair value is to determine the
price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date (the exit price).

ASC 820 establishes a
fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to
measure fair value into three levels: Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in
active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or
liabilities; Level 2 – observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in
active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3 – unobservable
inputs that are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value
hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority
to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques
that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk in
our assessment of fair value.  Considerable judgment is necessary to
interpret Level 2 and 3 inputs in determining the fair value of our financial
and non-financial assets and liabilities.  Accordingly, our fair value
estimates, which are made at the end of each reporting period, may be different
than the amounts that may ultimately be realized upon sale or disposition of
these assets.

Fair Value
Measurements on a Recurring Basis

Financial assets and
liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in our
consolidated financial statements consist of (i) marketable securities, (ii)
derivative positions in marketable equity securities, (iii) the assets of our
deferred compensation plan, which are primarily marketable equity securities and
equity investments in limited partnerships, (iv) Real Estate Fund investments,
and (v) mandatorily redeemable instruments (Series G-1 through G-4 convertible
preferred units and Series D-13 cumulative redeemable preferred units). 
The tables below aggregate the fair values of these financial assets and
liabilities by their levels in the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2011 and
2010, respectively.

Fair Value
Measurements on a Nonrecurring Basis

Non-financial assets
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in our consolidated financial
statements consist of real estate assets and investments in partially owned
entities that have been written-down to estimated fair value during 2011 and
2010.  See Note 2 –

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting
Policies

for details of impairment losses recognized during 2011
and 2010.  The fair values of these assets are determined using widely
accepted valuation techniques, including (i) discounted cash flow analysis,
which considers, among other things, leasing assumptions, growth rates, discount
rates and terminal capitalization rates, (ii) income capitalization approach,
which considers prevailing market capitalization rates, and (iii) comparable
sales activity.  Generally, we consider multiple valuation techniques when
measuring fair values but in certain circumstances, a single valuation technique
may be appropriate.  The tables below aggregate the fair values of these
assets by their levels in the fair value hierarchy.

13.    Stock-based
Compensation

Our Share Option
Plan (the “Plan”), which was approved in May 2010, provides the Compensation
Committee of the Board (the “Committee”) the ability to grant certain of our
employees and officers, incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights, performance shares, restricted shares and other stock-based
awards and Operating Partnership units, certain of which may provide for
dividends or dividend equivalents and voting rights prior to vesting. 
Awards may be granted up to a maximum of 6,000,000 shares, if all awards granted
are Full Value Awards, as defined, and up to 12,000,000 shares, if all of the
awards granted are Not Full Value Awards, as defined.  Full Value Awards
are awards of securities, such as restricted shares, that, if all vesting
requirements are met, do not require the payment of an exercise price or strike
price to acquire the securities.  Not Full Value Awards are awards of
securities, such as options, that do require the payment of an exercise price or
strike price.  This means, for example, if the Committee were to award only
restricted shares, it could award up to 6,000,000 restricted shares.  On
the other hand, if the Committee were to award only stock options, it could
award options to purchase up to 12,000,000 shares (at the applicable exercise
price).  The Committee may also issue any combination of awards under the
Plan, with reductions in availability of future awards made in accordance with
the above limitations.  As of December 31, 2011, we have approximately
5,582,000 shares available for future grants under the Plan, if all awards
granted are Full Value Awards, as defined.

In the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized an aggregate of $28,853,000,
$34,614,000 and $59,814,000, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense,
which is included as a component of “general and administrative expenses” on our
consolidated statements of income.  The year ended December 31, 2010
includes $2,800,000 of expense resulting from accelerating the vesting of
certain Operating Partnership units and 2006 out-performance plan units, which
were scheduled to fully vest in the first quarter of 2011, and the year ended
December 31, 2009 includes $32,588,000 of expense, representing the write-off of
the unamortized portion of awards that were voluntarily surrendered by nine of
our most senior executives in the first quarter of 2009.

Out-Performance
Plans

In March 2008, the
Committee approved a $75,000,000 out-performance plan (the “2008 OPP”). 
The fair value of the 2008 OPP awards on the date of grant, as adjusted for
estimated forfeitures, was approximately $21,600,000.  Of this amount,
$13,722,000 was expensed in the first quarter of 2009 upon the voluntary
surrender of these awards by our nine most senior executives, and the remainder
is being amortized into expense over a five-year vesting period beginning on the
date of grant, using a graded vesting attribution model.

In April 2006, the Committee approved a $100,000,000
out-performance plan (the “2006 OPP”).  The fair value of the 2006 OPP
awards on the date of grant, as adjusted for estimated forfeitures, was
approximately $46,141,000 and was amortized into expense over the five-year
vesting period beginning on the date of grant, using a graded vesting
attribution model.  In January 2007, the maximum performance threshold
under the 2006 OPP was achieved, concluding the performance period.

In the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized $740,000, $5,062,000 and
$23,493,000, respectively, of compensation expense related to these
awards.  Of the $23,493,000 of expense recognized in 2009, $13,722,000
related to the write-off of the unamortized portion of 2008 OPP that was
voluntarily surrendered by nine of our most senior executives.  As of
December 31, 2011, there was $510,000 of total unrecognized compensation costs
related to these plans, which will be recognized in 2012.  Distributions
paid on unvested OPP units are charged to “net income attributable to
noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership, including unit
distributions” on our consolidated statements of income and amounted to $32,000,
$815,000 and $1,935,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Options

Stock options are

price of our common shares on the NYSE on the date of grant, generally vest over
four years and expire 10 years from the date of grant.  Compensation
expense related to stock option awards is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the vesting period.  In the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and
2009, we recognized $8,794,000, $7,916,000 and $25,911,000, respectively, of
compensation expense related to stock options that vested during each
year.  Of the $25,911,000 of expense recognized in 2009, $18,866,000
related to the voluntary surrender of awards in 2009.  As of December 31,
2011, there was $20,398,000

Leases

As lessor:

We lease space to tenants under operating leases. Most of
the leases provide for the payment of fixed base rentals payable monthly in
advance. Office building leases generally require the tenants to reimburse us
for operating costs and real estate taxes above their base year costs. Shopping
center leases provide for pass-through to tenants the tenant’s share of real
estate taxes, insurance and maintenance. Shopping center leases also provide for
the payment by the lessee of additional rent based on a percentage of the
tenants’ sales. As of December 31, 2011, future base rental revenue under
non-cancelable operating leases, excluding rents for leases with an original
term of less than one year and rents resulting from the exercise of renewal
options, is as follows:

(Amounts in thousands)

6,045,584

These amounts do not include percentage rentals based on
tenants’ sales.  These percentage rents approximated $8,482,000, $7,912,000
and $8,394,000, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total
revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Former Bradlees Locations

Pursuant to a Master Agreement and Guaranty, dated May 1,
1992, we are due $5,000,000 per annum of additional rent from Stop & Shop
which was allocated to certain Bradlees former locations.  On December 31,
2002, prior to the expiration of the leases to which the additional rent was
allocated, we reallocated this rent to other former Bradlees leases also
guaranteed by Stop & Shop.  Stop & Shop is contesting our right to
reallocate and claims that we are no longer entitled to the additional
rent.  On November 7, 2011, the Court determined that we have a continuing
right to allocate the annual rent to unexpired leases covered by the Master
Agreement and Guaranty and directed entry of a judgment in our favor ordering
Stop & Shop to pay us the unpaid annual rent (see Note 20 – Commitments and
Contingencies – Litigation).  As of December 31, 2011, we have a
$41,983,000 receivable from Stop and Shop.

18.  Cleveland Medical Mart Development Project

In 2010, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into agreements with Cuyahoga County, Ohio (the “County”) to develop and operate the Cleveland Medical Mart and Convention Center (the “Facility”), a 1,000,000 square foot showroom, trade show and conference center in Cleveland’s central business district.  The County is funding the development of the Facility, using the proceeds it received from the issuance of general obligation bonds and other sources, up to the development budget of $465,000,000 and maintain effective control of the property.  During the 17-year development and operating period, our subsidiaries will receive net settled payments of approximately $10,000,000 per year, which are net of its $36,000,000 annual obligation to the County.  Our subsidiaries’ obligation has been pledged by the County to the bondholders, but is payable by our subsidiaries only to the extent that they first receive at least an equal payment from the County.  Our subsidiaries engaged a contractor to construct the Facility pursuant to a guaranteed maximum price contract; although our subsidiaries are ultimately responsible for cost overruns, the contractor is responsible for all costs incurred in excess of its contract and has provided a completion guaranty.  Construction of the Facility is expected to be completed in 2013.  Upon completion, our subsidiaries are required to fund $11,500,000, primarily for tenant improvements, and they are responsible for operating expenses and are entitled to the net operating income, if any, of the Facility.  The County may terminate the operating agreement five years from the completion of development and periodically thereafter, if our subsidiaries fail to achieve certain performance thresholds.

We account for these agreements using criteria set forth in ASC 605-25,

Multiple-Element Arrangements,

as our subsidiaries are providing development, marketing, leasing, and other property management related services over the 17-year term.  We recognize development fees using the percentage of completion method of accounting.  In the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized $154,080,000 of revenue, which is offset by development costs expensed of $145,824,000.

19.  Multiemployer Benefit Plans

Our subsidiaries make contributions to certain multiemployer defined benefit plans (“Multiemployer Pension Plans”) and health plans (“Multiemployer Health Plans”) for our union represented employees, pursuant to the respective collective bargaining agreements.

Multiemployer Pension Plans

Multiemployer Pension Plans differ from single-employer pension plans in that (i) contributions to multiemployer plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers and (ii) if other participating employers fail to make their contributions, each of our participating subsidiaries may be required to bear its then pro rata share of unfunded obligations.  If a participating subsidiary withdraws from a plan in which it participates, it may be subject to a withdrawal liability.  As of December 31, 2011, our subsidiaries' participation in these plans were not significant to our consolidated financial statements.

In the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, our subsidiaries contributed $10,168,000, $9,629,000 and $9,260,000, respectively, towards Multiemployer Pension Plans, which is included as a component of “operating” expenses on our consolidated statements of income.  Our subsidiaries’ contributions did not represent more than 5% of total employer contributions in any of these plans for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Multiemployer Health Plans

Multiemployer Health Plans in which our subsidiaries participate provide health benefits to eligible active and retired employees.  In the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, our subsidiaries contributed $23,847,000, $21,664,000 and $20,949,000, respectively, towards these plans, which is included as a component of “operating” expenses on our consolidated statements of income.

20.  Commitments and Contingencies

Insurance

We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, including coverage for terrorist acts, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods.  Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $180,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, up to a $180,000,000 annual aggregate.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC.  Coverage for NBCR losses is up to $2.0 billion per occurrence, for which PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and 15% of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of a covered loss.  We are ultimately responsible for any loss borne by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us.  However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space.  These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans.  As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $283,625,000.

At December 31, 2011, $22,085,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our revolving credit facilities.  Our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

We expect to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $288,799,000.

20.  Commitments and Contingencies - continued

Litigation

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including the matter referred to below, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In 2003, Stop & Shop filed an action against us in the New York Supreme Court, claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the leases to which the annual rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that an order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, as modified on appeal by the District Court, froze our right to reallocate and effectively terminated our right to collect the annual rent from Stop & Shop.  We asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid annual rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the annual rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect.   After summary judgment motions by both sides were denied, the parties conducted discovery.  A trial was held in November 2010.  On November 7, 2011, the Court determined that we have a continuing right to allocate the annual rent to unexpired leases covered by the Master Agreement and Guaranty, and directed entry of a judgment in our favor ordering Stop & Shop to pay us the unpaid annual rent accrued through February 28, 2011 in the amount of $37,422,000, a portion of the annual rent due from March 1, 2011 through the date of judgment, interest, and attorneys’ fees.  On December 16, 2011, a money judgment based on the Court’s decision was entered in our favor in the amount of $56,597,000 (including interest and costs).  The amount for attorneys’ fees is being addressed in a proceeding before a special referee.  Stop & Shop has appealed the Court’s decision and the judgment and has posted a bond to secure payment of the judgment.  On January 12, 2012, we commenced a new action against Stop & Shop seeking recovery of $2,500,000 of annual rent not included in the money judgment, plus additional annual rent as it accrues.

As of December 31, 2011, we have a $41,983,000 receivable from Stop and Shop, excluding amounts due to us for interest and costs resulting from the Court’s judgment.  In the fourth quarter of 2011, based on the Court’s decision, we recognized $23,521,000 of income, representing the portion of the $41,983,000 receivable that was previously reserved.  As a result of Stop & Shop’s appeal, we believe, after consultation with counsel, that the maximum reasonably possible loss is up to the total amount of the receivable of $41,983,000.

21.  Related Party Transactions

Alexander’s

We own 32.4% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President and Chief Executive Officer, are officers and directors of Alexander’s.  We provide various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements.  These agreements are described in Note 5 - Investments in Partially Owned Entities.

Interstate Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr. Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s, are Interstate’s two other partners. As of December 31, 2011, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 6.3% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 27.2% of Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term. We believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies, that the management agreement terms are fair to us. We earned $787,000, $815,000, and $782,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

21.  Related Party Transactions - continued

Other

Upon maturity on December 23, 2011, Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board of Trustees, repaid the Company his $13,122,500 outstanding loan.  Pursuant to a credit agreement dated November 1999, Mr. Roth may draw up to $15,000,000 of loans from the Company on a revolving basis.  Each loan bears interest, payable quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the loan is made and matures on the sixth anniversary of such loan.  Loans are collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the amount outstanding.  On December 23, 2011, Mr. Roth borrowed $13,122,500 under this facility, which bears interest at 1.27% per annum and matures on December 23, 2017.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

23.      Segment Information - continued

Notes to preceding tabular information:

(1)

EBITDA represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization." We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)

Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax expense in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these items from partially owned entities.

(3)

The tables below provide information about EBITDA from certain investments that are included in the "other" column of the preceding EBITDA by segment reconciliations. The totals for each of the columns below agree to the total EBITDA for the "other" column in the preceding EBITDA by segment reconciliations.

None.

Item 9A.              Controls and Procedures

Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:  There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of Vornado Realty Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As of December 31, 2011, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 was effective.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our trustees; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 175, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board of Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Vornado Realty Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of trustees, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011 of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules and included an explanatory paragraph relating to a change in method of presenting comprehensive income.
