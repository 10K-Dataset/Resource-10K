PART I

ITEM 1.        BUSINESS

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated
real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and
substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). 
Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its
shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and
the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their
obligations to creditors.  Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately
94.1%

of the common limited partnership interest
in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2014.  All references to “we,”
“us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its
consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership.

On January 15, 2015, we completed the spin-off of substantially
all of our retail segment comprised of 79 strip shopping centers, three malls, a
warehouse park and $225 million of cash to Urban Edge Properties (“UE”) (NYSE:
UE).  As part of this transaction, we received 5,712,000 UE operating
partnership units (5.4% ownership interest).

We currently own all or portions of:

New York:

·

20.1 million square feet of Manhattan office space in 31
properties;

·

2.5 million square feet of Manhattan street retail space in 56
properties;

·

Four residential properties containing 1,654 units;

·

The 1,700 room Hotel Pennsylvania located on Seventh Avenue at 33

rd

Street in the heart of the Penn Plaza district;

·

A 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX), which owns six
properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, including 731 Lexington
Avenue, the 1.3 million square foot Bloomberg, L.P. headquarters building;

Washington, DC:

·

16.1 million square feet of office space in 59 properties;

·

Seven residential properties containing 2,414 units;

Other Real Estate and
Related Investments:

·

The 3.6 million square foot Mart in Chicago;

·

A 70% controlling interest in 555 California Street, a
three-building office complex in San Francisco’s financial district aggregating
1.8 million square feet, known as the Bank of America Center;

·

A 25.0% interest in Vornado Capital Partners, our real estate
fund.  We are the general partner and investment manager of the fund;

·

A 32.6% interest in Toys “R” Us, Inc.; and

·

Other real estate and related investments.


Objectives and Strategy

Our business
objective is to maximize shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective
by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and execute our operating
strategies through:

·

Maintaining a superior team of operating
and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit

·

Investing in properties in select
markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there
is a high likelihood of capital appreciation

·

Acquiring quality properties at a
discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for
higher rents

·

Investing in retail properties in select
under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area

·

Developing and redeveloping our existing
properties to increase returns and maximize value

·

Investing
in operating companies that have a significant real estate component

We expect to
finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated
funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and
private capital markets.  We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares
or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or
otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

ACQUISITIONS

Since January
1, 2014, we completed the following acquisitions:

·

A 74.3% interest in the retail condominium of the St. Regis Hotel,

$700 million

·

The land under our 715 Lexington Avenue retail property, located
on the Southeast corner of 58

th

Street and Lexington Avenue in
Manhattan, for $63 million

·

We increased our ownership in One Park Avenue to 55.0% from 46.5%
through a joint venture with an institutional investor

·

We increased our ownership in Crowne Plaza Times Square Hotel to
33% from 11% by co-investing with our 25% owned Real Estate Fund and one of the
Fund’s limited partners to buy out the Fund’s joint venture partner’s 57%
interest

Additional
details about our acquisitions are provided in the “Overview” of Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.


FINANCINGS

Since January

SEGMENT DATA

We operate in the following
business segments: New York, Washington, DC, Retail Properties, and Toys “R” Us
(“Toys”).  Financial information related to these business segments for the
years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 is set forth in Note 25 – Segment
Information to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

SEASONALITY

Our revenues and expenses are
subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings,
cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the
current quarter to the previous quarter. The business of Toys is highly
seasonal and substantially all of Toys’ net income is generated in its fourth
quarter, which we record on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter. The
New York and Washington, DC segments have historically experienced higher
utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year.  The Retail
Properties segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the
recognition of percentage and specialty rental income.

tenants ACCOUNTING FOR over 10% of revenues

None of our tenants accounted for
more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013
and 2012

.


Certain
Activities

We do not base our acquisitions and investments on
specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our
properties for long‑term investment; however, it is possible that
properties in our portfolio may be sold when circumstances warrant. Further, we
have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which
could be invested in a specific property or property type. While we may seek
the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material
transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from
time to time by our Board of Trustees without the vote of shareholders.

Employees

As of December 31, 2014, we have approximately 4,503

employees, of which 329 are corporate staff. The New
York segment has 3,400

employees, including 2,735

employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a
wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering
services primarily to our New York and Washington, DC properties and 508
employees at the Hotel Pennsylvania. The Washington, DC and Retail Properties
segments have 457 and 77 employees, respectively and the Mart properties have 240
employees.  The foregoing does not include employees of partially owned entities.

principal executive offices

Our principal executive offices are located at 888
Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019; telephone (212) 894‑7000.

ITEM
1A.     RISK FACTORS

Material factors that may adversely affect our
business, operations and financial condition are summarized below.  The risks
and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones we face. 
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we
currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.  See
“Forward-Looking Statements” contained herein on page 3.

Real Estate
Investments’ Value and Income Fluctuate Due to Various Factors.

The value of real estate fluctuates depending on
conditions in the general economy and the real estate business. These
conditions may also adversely impact our revenues and cash flows.

The factors that affect the value of our real
estate investments include, among other things:

·

global,
national, regional and local economic conditions;

·

competition
from other available space;

·

local
conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real
estate in the area;

·

how
well we manage our properties;

·

the development and/or redevelopment of our properties;

·

changes
in market rental rates;

·

the
timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;

·

whether
we are able to pass all or portions of any increases in operating costs through
to tenants;

·

changes
in real estate taxes and other expenses;

·

whether
tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property
attractive;

·

the
financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies
or defaults;

·

availability
of financing on acceptable terms or at all;

·

inflation or deflation;

·

fluctuations
in interest rates;

·

our
ability to obtain adequate insurance;

·

changes
in zoning laws and taxation;

·

government
regulation;

·

consequences
of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attacks against, the United States
or individual acts of violence in public spaces including retail centers;

·

potential
liability under environmental or other laws or regulations;

·

natural disasters;

·

general
competitive factors; and

·

climate changes.

The rents or sales proceeds we receive and the
occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes
in any of these factors. If rental revenues, sales proceeds and/or occupancy
levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available to pay
indebtedness and for distribution to shareholders. In addition, some of our
major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance
costs generally do not decline when the related rents decline.

Capital
markets and economic conditions can materially affect our liquidity, financial
condition and results of operations as well as the value of our debt and equity
securities.

There are many factors that can affect the value
of our debt and equity securities, including the state of the capital markets
and the economy.  Demand for office and retail space may decline nationwide, as
it did in 2008 and 2009 due to the economic downturn, bankruptcies, downsizing,
layoffs and cost cutting.  Government action or inaction may adversely affect
the state of the capital markets.  The cost and availability of credit may be
adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads, which
may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our
results of operations, and the liquidity and financial condition of our
tenants.  Our inability or the inability of our tenants to timely refinance
maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs may
materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the
value of our debt and equity securities.


Real
estate is a competitive business.

We compete with a large number of property owners
and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their
investments than we are. Principal factors of competition include rents
charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property
and the breadth and quality of services provided. Our success depends upon,
among other factors, trends of the global, national, regional and local
economies, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective
tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and
renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulation, legislation and population
and employment trends.

We depend on leasing space
to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from tenants who
may not be able to pay.

Our financial results depend significantly on
leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms. In
addition, because a majority of our income comes from renting of real property,
our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and funds available for
distribution to shareholders will decrease if a significant number of our
tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain occupancy
levels on favorable terms. If a tenant does not pay its rent, we may not be
able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial
legal costs.  During periods of economic adversity, there may be an increase in
the number of tenants that cannot pay their rent and an increase in vacancy
rates.

Bankruptcy or insolvency of
tenants may decrease our revenue, net income and available cash.

From time to time, some of our tenants have
declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become
insolvent in the future. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could
cause us to suffer lower revenues and operational difficulties, including
leasing the remainder of the property. As a result, the bankruptcy or
insolvency of a major tenant could result in decreased revenue, net income and
funds available to pay our indebtedness or make distributions to shareholders.

We may
incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and environmental
contamination may impair our ability to lease and/or sell real estate.

Our operations and properties are subject to
various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection
of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic
substances and health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or
previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and
clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or
operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties
for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up
costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination. These laws often
impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the
release of the substances or caused the release. The presence of contamination
or the failure to remediate contamination may impair our ability to sell or
lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other laws
and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can
require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event
of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of
and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. The maintenance and removal of lead
paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) are also regulated by federal and state laws. We are also subject to
risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants
such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can
be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in
susceptible individuals. Our predecessor companies may be subject to similar
liabilities for activities of those companies in the past.  We could incur
fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial
action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or related claims
arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure to contamination
at or from our properties.

Each of our properties has been subject to varying
degrees of environmental assessment. To date, these environmental assessments
have not revealed any environmental condition material to our business.
However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of
contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination,  human
exposure to contamination or changes in clean-up or compliance requirements
could result in significant costs to us.

In addition, we may become subject to costs or
taxes, or increases therein, associated with natural resource or energy usage
(such as a “carbon tax”).  These costs or taxes could increase our operating
costs and decrease the cash available to pay our obligations or distribute to
equity holders.


We face risks
associated with our tenants being designated “Prohibited Persons” by the Office
of Foreign Assets Control and similar requirements.

Pursuant to
Executive Order 13224 and other laws, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of
the United States Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”) maintains a list of
persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned
(“Prohibited Persons”) from conducting business or engaging in transactions in
the United States and thereby restricts our doing business with such persons. 
Our leases, loans and other agreements may require us to comply with OFAC and
related requirements.  If a tenant or other party with whom we conduct business
is placed on the OFAC list or is otherwise a party with which we are prohibited
from doing business, we may be required to terminate the lease or other
agreement.  Any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or otherwise
negatively affect our financial results and cash flows.

Our business and operations would suffer in
the event of system failures.

Despite system redundancy, the implementation of
security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our
internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages
from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access,
energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication
failures.  Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our
operations could result in a material disruption to our business.  We may also
incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions.

The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a
deficiency in our cyber security, could negatively impact our business by
causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our
confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships, all of
which could negatively impact our financial results.

A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse
event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our
information resources. More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional
attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access
to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or steal confidential
information. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks
posed to our systems, both internal and those we have outsourced. Our primary
risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident are
theft of assets, operational interruption, damage to our relationship with our
tenants, and private data exposure.  We have implemented processes, procedures
and controls to help mitigate these risks, but these measures, as well as our
increased awareness

of
a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that our financial results will
not be negatively impacted by such an incident.

Some of our potential
losses may not be covered by insurance.

We maintain
general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all
risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per
occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods.  Our California
properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $180,000,000 per
occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the
affected property, up to a $180,000,000 annual aggregate. We maintain coverage
for terrorism acts with limits of $4.0 billion per occurrence and in the
aggregate, and $2.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism
involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) terrorism
events, as defined by Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act,
which expires in December 2020.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our
wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a
portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our
earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for NBCR
acts.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured
by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure
to PPIC.  For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and
15% of the balance of a covered loss (16% effective January 1, 2016) and the
Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of a covered loss (84%
effective January 1, 2016).  We are ultimately responsible for any loss
incurred by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance
market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we
cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable
terms in the future.

Our debt
instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are
non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements
contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we
believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these
agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at
reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage
than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our
properties and expand our portfolio.


Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with
Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in
substantial costs.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”)
generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, meet
certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. 
Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government
or the award of damages to private litigants and/or legal fees to their
counsel.  From time to time persons have asserted claims against us with
respect to some of our properties under the ADA, but to date such claims have
not resulted in any material expense or liability.  If, under the ADA, we are
required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or
more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as
the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders.

Our properties are subject to various federal,
state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life
safety requirements.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could
incur fines or private damage awards.  We do not know whether existing
requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will
require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow
and results of operations.

Our Investments Are
Concentrated in the New York CITY METROPOLITAN AREA and Washington, DC /
NORTHERN VIRGINIA Area. Circumstances Affecting These Areas Generally Could
Adversely Affect Our Business.

A
significant portion of our properties are located in the New York City / New
Jersey metropolitan area and Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area and are
affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent to those areas.

In 2014, approximately 98% of our EBITDA,
excluding items that affect comparability, came from properties located in the
New York City metropolitan area and the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia
area.  We may continue to concentrate a significant portion of our future
acquisitions in these areas or in other geographic real estate markets in the
United States or abroad.  Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns
and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact these markets in
either the short or long term. Declines in the economy or declines in real
estate markets in these areas could hurt our financial performance and the
value of our properties.  In addition to the factors affecting the national
economic condition generally, the factors affecting economic conditions in
these regions include:

·

financial
performance and productivity of the media, advertising, financial, technology,
retail, insurance and real estate industries;

·

space
needs of, and budgetary constraints affecting, the United States Government,
including the effect of a deficit reduction plan and/or base closures and
repositioning under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 2005, as
amended;

·

business
layoffs or downsizing;

·

industry
slowdowns;

·

relocations
of businesses;

·

changing
demographics;

·

increased
telecommuting and use of alternative work places;

·

infrastructure
quality; and

·

any
oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.

It is impossible for us to assess the future
effects of trends in the economic and investment climates of the geographic
areas in which we concentrate, and more generally of the United States, or the
real estate markets in these areas.  Local, national or global economic
downturns, would negatively affect our businesses and profitability.

Terrorist
attacks, such as those of September 11, 2001 in New York City and the Washington,   DC area, may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to
generate cash flow.

We have significant investments in large
metropolitan areas, including the New York, Washington, DC, Chicago and San
Francisco metropolitan areas. In the aftermath of a terrorist attack, tenants
in these areas may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated,
lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less
likely targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to
patronize businesses in these areas. This, in turn, would trigger a decrease in
the demand for space in these areas, which could increase vacancies in our
properties and force us to lease space on less favorable terms. As a result,
the value of our properties and the level of our revenues and cash flows could
decline materially.

Natural
Disasters could have a concentrated impact on the areas where we operate and
could adversely impact our results.

Our investments are concentrated in the New York,
Washington, DC, Chicago and San Francisco metropolitan areas.  Natural
disasters, including earthquakes, storms and hurricanes, could impact our
properties in these and other areas in which we operate.  Potentially adverse
consequences of “global warming” could similarly have an impact on our
properties.  As a result, we could become subject to significant losses and/or
repair costs that may or may not be fully covered by insurance and to the risk
of business interruption.  The incurrence of these losses, costs or business
interruptions may adversely affect our operating and financial results.


We May Acquire or Sell Assets or Entities or Develop
Properties. Our Failure or Inability to Consummate These Transactions or Manage
the Results of These Transactions Could Adversely Affect Our Operations and
Financial Results.

We may
acquire, develop or redevelop real estate and acquire related companies and
this may create risks.

We may acquire, develop or redevelop properties or
acquire real estate related companies when we believe doing so is consistent
with our business strategy. We may not succeed in (i) developing, redeveloping
or acquiring real estate and real estate related companies; (ii) completing
these activities on time or within budget; and (iii) leasing or selling
developed, redeveloped or acquired properties at amounts sufficient to cover
our costs.  Competition in these activities could also significantly increase our
costs. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or
time-consuming and could divert management’s attention. Acquisitions or
developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level
of market knowledge may result in weaker than anticipated performance. We may
also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that we have begun
pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred. 
Furthermore, we may be exposed to the liabilities of properties or companies
acquired, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition.

From time to time we have
made, and in the future we may seek to make, one or more material
acquisitions.  The announcement of such a material acquisition may result in a rapid
and significant decline in the price of our common shares.

We are continuously looking at material
transactions that we believe will maximize shareholder value.  However, an
announcement by us of one or more significant acquisitions could result in a
quick and significant decline in the price of our common shares.

It may be difficult to buy
and sell real estate quickly, which may limit our flexibility.

Real estate investments are relatively difficult
to buy and sell quickly. Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary our
portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.

We may
not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the debt
associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so
without incurring additional costs.  In addition, when we dispose of or sell
assets, we may not be able to reinvest the sales proceeds and earn similar
returns.

As part of an acquisition of a property, or a
portfolio of properties, we may agree, and in the past have agreed, not to
dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness for a
long-term period, unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the
seller. These agreements could result in us holding on to properties that we
would otherwise sell and not pay down or refinance.  In addition, when we
dispose of or sell assets, we may not be able to reinvest the sales proceeds
and earn returns similar to those generated by the assets that were sold.

From
time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, investments
in companies over which we do not have sole control. Some of these companies
operate in industries with different risks than investing and operating real
estate.

From time to time we have made, and in the future
we may seek to make, investments in companies that we may not control,
including, but not limited to, Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”),
Toys “R” Us (“Toys”), Lexington Realty Trust (“Lexington”), and other equity
and mezzanine investments. Although these businesses generally have a
significant real estate component, some of them operate in businesses that are
different from investing and operating real estate, including operating or
managing toy stores. Consequently, we are subject to operating and financial
risks of those industries and to the risks associated with lack of control,
such as having differing objectives than our partners or the entities in which
we invest, or becoming involved in disputes, or competing directly or
indirectly with these partners or entities.  In addition, we rely on the
internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their
failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may
adversely affect us.

We are
subject to risks that affect the general and New York City retail environments.

Certain of our properties are Manhattan street
retail properties.  As such, these properties are affected by the general and
New York City retail environments, including the level of consumer spending and
consumer confidence, the threat of terrorism and increasing competition from
retailers, outlet malls, retail websites and catalog companies.  These factors
could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants and the
willingness of retailers to lease space in our retail locations, and in turn,
adversely affect us.


Our investment in Toys has in the past and
may in the future result in increased seasonality and volatility in our
reported earnings.

We carry our Toys investment at zero.  As a result, we
no longer record our equity in Toys' income or loss.   Because Toys
is a retailer, its operations subject us to the risks of a retail company that
are different than those presented by our other lines of business. The business
of Toys is highly seasonal and substantially all of Toys net income is
generated in its fourth quarter.  It is possible that the value of Toys may
increase and we could again resume recording our equity in Toys' income or
loss, which would increase the seasonality and volatility of our reported
earnings.

Our decision to dispose of real estate
assets would change the holding period assumption in our valuation analyses,
which could result in material impairment losses and adversely affect our
financial results.

We evaluate
real estate assets for impairment based on the projected cash flow of the asset
over our anticipated holding period.  If we change our intended holding period,
due to our intention to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset, then under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we
must reevaluate whether that asset is impaired.  Depending on the carrying
value of the property at the time we change our intention and the amount that
we estimate we would receive on disposal, we may record an impairment loss that
would adversely affect our financial results. This loss could be material to
our results of operations in the period that it is recognized.

We
invest in marketable equity securities.  The value of these investments may
decline as a result of operating performance or economic or market conditions.

We invest in marketable equity securities of
publicly-traded companies, such as Lexington Realty Trust.  As of December 31, 2014,
our marketable securities have an aggregate carrying amount of $206,323,000, at
market.  Significant declines in the value of these investments due to, among
other reasons, operating performance or economic or market conditions, may
result in the recognition of impairment losses which could be material.

Our
Organizational and Financial Structure Gives Rise to Operational and Financial
Risks.

We may not be able to
obtain capital to make investments.

We depend primarily on external financing to fund
the growth of our business. This is because one of the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for a REIT is that it distributes
90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its shareholders.
There is a separate requirement to distribute net capital gains or pay a
corporate level tax in lieu thereof. Our access to debt or equity financing
depends on the willingness of third parties to lend or make equity investments
and on conditions in the capital markets generally. Although we believe that we
will be able to finance any investments we may wish to make in the foreseeable
future, there can be no assurance that new financing will be available or
available on acceptable terms.  For information about our available sources of
funds, see

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources”

and the notes to
the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Vornado
Realty Trust (“Vornado”) depends on dividends and distributions from its direct
and indirect subsidiaries. The creditors and preferred security holders of
these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries
before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to Vornado.

Substantially all of Vornado’s assets are held
through its Operating Partnership that holds substantially all of its
properties and assets through subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership’s cash
flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by its subsidiaries, and in turn,
substantially all of Vornado’s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to
it by the Operating Partnership. The creditors of each of Vornado’s direct and
indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations
to them, when due and payable, before distributions may be made by that
subsidiary to its equity holders. Thus, the Operating Partnership’s ability to
make distributions to holders of its units depends on its subsidiaries’ ability
first to satisfy their obligations to their creditors and then to make
distributions to the Operating Partnership. Likewise, Vornado’s ability to pay
dividends to holders of common and preferred shares depends on the Operating
Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and
make distributions payable to holders of preferred units and then to make
distributions to Vornado.


Furthermore, the holders
of preferred units of the Operating Partnership are entitled to receive
preferred distributions before payment of distributions to holders of Class A
units of the Operating Partnership, including Vornado. Thus, Vornado’s ability
to pay cash dividends to its shareholders and satisfy its debt obligations
depends on the Operating Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations
to its creditors and make distributions to holders of its preferred units and
then to holders of its Class A units, including Vornado.  As of December 31, 2014,
there were three series of preferred units of the Operating Partnership not
held by Vornado with a total liquidation value of $56,206,000.

In addition, Vornado’s participation in any
distribution of the assets of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries upon
the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency, is only after the claims of the
creditors, including trade creditors and preferred security holders, are
satisfied.

We have
outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may increase and
refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.

We rely on both secured and unsecured, variable
rate and non-variable rate debt to finance acquisitions and development
activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt financing
or refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and
results of operations would likely be adversely affected.  In addition, the
cost of our existing debt may increase, especially in the case of a rising
interest rate environment, and we may not be able to refinance our existing
debt in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms.  If the cost or amount of
our indebtedness increases or we cannot refinance our debt in sufficient
amounts or on acceptable terms, we are at risk of credit ratings downgrades and
default on our obligations that could adversely affect our financial condition
and results of operations.

Covenants
in our debt instruments could adversely affect our financial condition and our
acquisitions and development activities.

The mortgages on our properties contain customary
covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of
the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue
insurance coverage. Our unsecured indebtedness and debt that we may obtain in
the future may contain customary restrictions, requirements and other
limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including covenants that
limit our ability to incur debt based upon the level of our ratio of total debt
to total assets, our ratio of secured debt to total assets, our ratio of EBITDA
to interest expense, and fixed charges, and that require us to maintain a
certain level of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt. Our ability to borrow
is subject to compliance with these and other covenants. In addition, failure
to comply with our covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt
instrument, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from
other sources or give possession of a secured property to the lender. Under
those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or
may be available only on unattractive terms.

Vornado may fail to qualify
or remain qualified as a REIT and may be required to pay income taxes at
corporate rates.

Although we believe that we will remain organized
and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes, we may fail to remain so qualified. Qualifications are governed by
highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which
there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and depend on
various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control.  In
addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court
decisions may significantly change the relevant tax laws and/or the federal
income tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT.  If, with respect to any
taxable year, we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT and do not
qualify under statutory relief provisions, we could not deduct distributions to
shareholders in computing our taxable income and would have to pay federal
income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The federal income
tax payable would include any applicable alternative minimum tax. If we had to
pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute to
shareholders and pay our indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years
involved, and we would no longer be required to make distributions to
shareholders.  In addition, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a
REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification
was lost, unless we were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory
provisions.

We face
possible adverse changes in tax laws, which may result in an increase in our
tax liability.

From time to time changes in state and local tax
laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax
liability. The shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in
recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes.
If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets
or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for
payment of dividends.

Loss of
our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of
our common shares.

We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth,
the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado. 
While we believe that we could find a replacement for him and other key
personnel, the loss of their services could harm our operations and adversely
affect the value of our common shares.


Vornado’s charter documents and applicable law may hinder
any attempt to acquire us.

Our Amended and Restated
Declaration of Trust (the “declaration of trust”) sets limits on the ownership
of our shares.

Generally, for Vornado to maintain its
qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% in
value of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of Vornado may be owned,
directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the
last half of Vornado’s taxable year. The Internal Revenue Code defines
“individuals” for purposes of the requirement described in the preceding
sentence to include some types of entities. Under Vornado’s declaration of trust,
as amended, no person may own more than 6.7% of the outstanding common shares
of any class, or 9.9% of the outstanding preferred shares of any class, with
some exceptions for persons who held common shares in excess of the 6.7% limit
before Vornado adopted the limit and other persons approved by Vornado’s Board
of Trustees. These restrictions on transferability and ownership may delay,
deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might
involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the
shareholders.

The Maryland General Corporation Law (the
“MGCL”) contains provisions that may reduce the likelihood of certain takeover
transactions.

The MGCL

imposes
conditions and restrictions on certain “business combinations” (including,
among other transactions, a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or, in
certain circumstances, an asset transfer or issuance of equity securities)
between a Maryland REIT and certain persons who beneficially own at least 10%
of the corporation’s stock (an “interested shareholder”). Unless approved in
advance by the board of trustees of the trust, or otherwise exempted by the
statute, such a business combination is prohibited for a period of five years
after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an
interested shareholder.  After such five-year period, a business combination
with an interested shareholder must be: (a) recommended by the board of
trustees of the trust, and (b) approved by the affirmative vote of at least (i)
80% of the trust’s outstanding shares entitled to vote and (ii) two-thirds of
the trust’s outstanding shares entitled to vote which are not held by the
interested shareholder with whom the business combination is to be effected,
unless, among other things, the trust’s common shareholders receive a “fair
price” (as defined by the statute) for their shares and the consideration is
received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested
shareholder for his or her shares.

In approving a transaction, the Board may provide
that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval,
with any terms and conditions determined by the Board.  Vornado’s Board has
adopted a resolution exempting any business combination between Vornado and any
trustee or officer of Vornado or its affiliates.  As a result, any trustee or
officer of Vornado or its affiliates may be able to enter into business
combinations with Vornado that may not be in the best interest of Vornado’s
shareholders. With respect to business combinations with other persons, the
business combination provisions of the MGCL may have the effect of delaying,
deferring or preventing a change in control of Vornado or other transaction
that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the
shareholders. The business combination statute may discourage others from
trying to acquire control of Vornado and increase the difficulty of
consummating any offer.

Vornado has a classified Board of Trustees and that may
reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Vornado’s Board of Trustees is divided into three
classes of trustees. Trustees of each class are chosen for three-year staggered
terms. Staggered terms of trustees may reduce the possibility of a tender offer
or an attempt to change control of Vornado, even though a tender offer or
change in control might be in the best interest of Vornado’s shareholders.

We may issue additional
shares in a manner that could adversely affect the likelihood of certain
takeover transactions.

Vornado’s declaration of trust authorizes the
Board of Trustees to:

·

cause
Vornado to issue additional authorized but unissued common shares or preferred
shares;

·

classify
or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred shares;

·

set
the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified
shares that Vornado issues; and

·

increase,
without shareholder approval, the number of shares of beneficial interest that
Vornado may issue.

The Board of Trustees could establish a series of
preferred shares whose terms could delay, deter or prevent a change in control
of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise
be in the best interest of Vornado’s shareholders, although the Board of
Trustees does not now intend to establish a series of preferred shares of this
kind. Vornado’s declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that
may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado or other transaction
that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our
shareholders.


We
may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our shareholders.

Our operating and financial policies, including
our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other companies,
growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively
determined by our Board of Trustees. Accordingly, our shareholders do not
control these policies.

Our Ownership
Structure and Related-Party Transactions May Give Rise to Conflicts of
Interest.

Steven
Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise substantial influence over us. They
and some of our other trustees and officers have interests or positions in
other entities that may compete with us.

As of December 31, 2014, Interstate Properties, a
New Jersey general partnership, and its partners owned an aggregate of approximately
6.6% of the common shares of Vornado and 26.3% of the common stock of
Alexander’s Inc. (NYSE: ALX) (“Alexander’s”), which is described below.  Steven
Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the three partners of
Interstate Properties. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer of Vornado, the managing general partner of Interstate
Properties and the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of
Alexander’s. Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are trustees of Vornado and also
directors of Alexander’s.

Because of these overlapping interests,
Mr. Roth and Interstate Properties and its partners may have substantial
influence over Vornado and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Vornado’s
shareholders for approval. In addition, certain decisions concerning our
operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among
Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate Properties and our other
equity or debt holders. In addition, Mr. Roth, Interstate Properties and
its partners, and Alexander’s currently and may in the future engage in a wide
variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts
of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as which of these
entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business
opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties
and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential
competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted,
competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as
acquisitions and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these
entities.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of
Interstate Properties under a management agreement for which we receive an
annual fee equal to 4% of base rent and percentage rent.  See the related party
disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

There may be conflicts of
interest between Alexander’s and us.

As of December 31, 2014, we owned 32.4% of the
outstanding common stock of Alexander’s. Alexander’s is a REIT that has six
properties, which are located in the greater New York metropolitan area.  In
addition to the 2.1% that they indirectly own through Vornado, Interstate
Properties, which is described above, and its partners owned 26.3% of the
outstanding common stock of Alexander’s as of December 31, 2014. Mr. Roth
is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Office of Vornado, the
Managing General Partner of Interstate Properties, and the Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s.  Messrs. Wight and
Mandelbaum are trustees of Vornado and also directors of Alexander’s and
general partners of Interstate Properties.  Dr. Richard West is a trustee of
Vornado and a director of Alexander’s.  In addition, Joseph Macnow, our
Executive Vice President – Finance and Chief Administrative Officer, is the
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Alexander’s, and
Stephen W. Theriot, our Chief Financial Officer, is the Assistant Treasurer of
Alexander’s.

We manage, develop and lease Alexander’s
properties under management and development agreements and leasing agreements
under which we receive annual fees from Alexander’s. See the related party
disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.


The Number of Shares of Vornado Realty Trust and the
Market for Those Shares Give Rise to Various Risks.

The trading price of our
common shares has been volatile and may fluctuate.

The trading price of our common shares has been
volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of a number of
factors, many of which are outside our control.  In addition, the stock market
is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect
the market prices of the shares of many companies.  These broad market
fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market
price of our common shares.  Among the factors that could affect the price of
our common shares are:

·

our financial condition and performance;

·

the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of
tenant bankruptcies or defaults;

·

actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating
results and financial condition;

·

our dividend policy;

·

the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and
the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in comparison to other equity
securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and
fixed income securities;

·

uncertainty and volatility in the equity and credit markets;

·

fluctuations in interest rates;

·

changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of
research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by
rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs;

·

failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;

·

speculation in the press or investment community;

·

strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions
or restructurings;

·

the extent of institutional investor interest in us;

·

the extent of short-selling of our common shares and the shares
of our competitors;

·

fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our
competitors;

·

general financial and economic market conditions and, in
particular, developments related to market conditions for REITs and other real
estate related companies;

·

domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our
performance; and

·

all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report
on the Form 10-K.

A significant
decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for shareholders.

Vornado
has many shares available for future sale, which could hurt the market price of
its shares.

The interests of our current shareholders could be
diluted if we issue additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2014, we
had authorized but unissued, 62,112,502 common shares of beneficial interest,
$.04 par value and 57,266,023 preferred shares of beneficial interest, no par
value; of which 19,488,139 common shares are reserved for issuance upon
redemption of Class A Operating Partnership units, convertible securities and
employee stock options and 11,200,000 preferred shares are reserved for
issuance upon redemption of preferred Operating Partnership units.  Any shares
not reserved may be issued from time to time in public or private offerings or
in connection with acquisitions.  In addition, common and preferred shares
reserved may be sold upon issuance in the public market after registration
under the Securities Act or under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or
other available exemptions from registration.  We cannot predict the effect
that future sales of our common and preferred shares or Operating Partnership
Class A and preferred units will have on the market prices of our outstanding
shares.

In addition, under Maryland law, the Board has the
authority to increase the number of authorized shares without shareholder
approval.

Item 1b.     unresolved
staff comments

There are no unresolved comments from the staff of
the Securities Exchange Commission as of the date of this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

(3)

As of December 31, 2014, we own junior and senior mezzanine
  loans of 85 Tenth Avenue with an accreted balance of $147.6 million.  The
  junior and senior mezzanine loans bear paid-in-kind interest of 12% and 9%,
  respectively and mature in May 2017.  We account for our investment in 85
  Tenth Avenue using the equity method of accounting because we will receive a 49.9%
  interest in the property after repayment of the junior mezzanine loan.  As a
  result of recording our share of the GAAP losses of the property, the net carrying
  amount of these loans is $28.2 million on our consolidated balance sheets.


New York

As of December 31, 2014, our New York segment consisted of 27.6 million square feet in 72 properties.  The 27.6 million square feet is comprised of 20.1 million square feet of office space in 31 properties, 2.5 million square feet of retail space in 56 properties, four residential properties containing 1,654 units, the 1.4 million square foot Hotel Pennsylvania, and our 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”), which owns six properties in the greater New York metropolitan area.  The New York segment also includes 10 garages totaling 1.7 million square feet (4,909 spaces) which are managed by, or leased to, third parties.

New York lease terms generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 20 years for major tenants, and may provide for extension options at market rates.  Leases typically provide for periodic step‑ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants their share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year.  Electricity is provided to tenants on a sub-metered basis or included in rent based on surveys and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases.  Leases also typically provide for free rent and tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.

As of December 31, 2014, the occupancy rate for our New York segment was 96.9%.

Washington, DC

As of December 31, 2014, our Washington, DC segment consisted of 72 properties aggregating 19.1 million square feet comprised of 16.1

million square feet of office space in 59 properties, seven residential properties containing 2,414 units and a hotel property.  In addition, we are in the process of developing a 699-unit residential project with a 37,000 square foot Whole Foods Market at the base of the building and own 18.2 acres of undeveloped land.  The Washington, DC segment also includes 56 garages totaling approximately 8.9 million square feet (29,628 spaces) which are managed by, or leased to, third parties.

Washington, DC office lease terms generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 15 years for major tenants, and may provide for extension options at either pre-negotiated or market rates. Leases typically provide for periodic step-ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants, the tenants’ share of increases in real estate taxes and certain property operating expenses over a base year. Periodic step-ups in rent are usually based upon either fixed percentage increases or the consumer price index. Leases also typically provide for free rent and tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.

As of December 31, 2014, the occupancy rate for our Washington DC segment was 83.8%, and 25.8% of the occupied space was leased to various agencies of the U.S. Government.

Base Realignment and Closure (“BRAC”)

Our
Washington, DC segment was impacted by the BRAC statute, which required the
Department of Defense (“DOD”) to relocate from 2,395,000 square feet in our
buildings in the Northern Virginia area to government owned military bases. 
See page 47 for the status of BRAC related move-outs.


RETAIL
PROPERTIES

During 2014, we substantially completed our exit
from our Retail Properties segment which comprises our non-Manhattan strip
shopping centers and regional malls business as follows:

On February
24, 2014, we sold the Broadway Mall in Hicksville, Long Island, New York, for
$94,000,000.

On March 2, 2014, we entered into an agreement to
transfer upon completion, the redeveloped Springfield Town Center, a 1,350,000
square foot mall located in Springfield, Fairfax County, Virginia, to
Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (NYSE: PEI) (“PREIT”) in exchange for
$465,000,000 comprised of $340,000,000 of cash and $125,000,000 of PREIT
operating partnership units.  The redevelopment was substantially completed in
October 2014, at which time we reclassified the assets, liabilities and
financial results to discontinued operations.  The transfer of the property to
PREIT is expected to be completed no later than March 31, 2015.

On July 8,
2014, we sold the Beverly Connection, a 335,000 square foot power shopping
center in Los Angeles, California, for $260,000,000, of which $239,000,000 was
cash and $21,000,000 was 10-year mezzanine seller financing.

We sold six small
retail assets during 2014 in separate transactions, for an aggregate of
$66,410,000 in cash.

On January 15, 2015, we spun-off 79 strip
shopping centers, three malls, and a warehouse park to Urban Edge Properties (“UE”)
(NYSE: UE). Beginning with the first quarter of 2015, the financial results of
these properties will be classified as discontinued operations.

Retail
Properties’ lease terms generally range from five years or less in some
instances for smaller tenants to as long as 25 years for major tenants. 
Leases generally provide for reimbursements of real estate taxes, insurance and
common area maintenance charges (including roof and structure in strip shopping
centers, unless it is the tenant’s direct responsibility), and percentage rents
based on tenant sales volume.  Percentage rents accounted for less than 1% of the
Retail Properties total revenues during 2014.

As of December
31, 2014, the occupancy rate for the Retail Properties segment was 95.9%.

________________________________

(1)   FFO
is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors
of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). 
NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gain from
sales of depreciated real estate assets, real estate impairment losses,
depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, extraordinary
items and other specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such
adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are
used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons
of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it
excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains
on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the
value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating
based on existing market conditions.  FFO does not represent cash generated
from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available
to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net
income as a performance measure or cash flows as a liquidity measure.  FFO may
not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Overview

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated
real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and
substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). 
Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its
shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and
the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their
obligations to creditors.  Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately
94.1% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership
at December 31, 2014.  All references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and
“Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries,
including the Operating Partnership.

On
January 15, 2015, we completed the spin-off of substantially all of our retail segment
comprised of 79 strip shopping centers, three malls, a warehouse park and $225
million of cash to Urban Edge Properties (“UE”) (NYSE: UE).  As part of this
transaction, we received 5,712,000 UE operating partnership units (5.4%
ownership interest).  We are providing transition services to UE for an initial
period of up to two years, including information technology, human resources,
tax and public reporting.  UE is providing us with leasing and property
management services for (i) the Monmouth Mall, (ii) certain small retail
properties which did not fit UE’s strategy that we plan to sell, and (iii) our
affiliate, Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX), Rego Park retail assets.  Steven
Roth, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Board of
Trustees of UE.  The spin-off distribution was effected by Vornado distributing
one UE common share for every two Vornado common shares.  Beginning in the
first quarter of 2015, the historical financial results of UE will be reflected
in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all
periods presented.

We own and operate office and retail properties
(our “core” operations) with large concentrations in the New York City
metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area. In
addition, we have a 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX)
(“Alexander’s”), which owns six properties in the greater New York metropolitan
area, a 32.6% interest in Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”) as well as interests in
other real estate and related investments.

Our business
objective is to maximize shareholder value, which we measure by the total
return provided to our shareholders. Below is a table comparing our performance
to the FTSE NAREIT Office Index (“Office REIT”) and the Morgan Stanley REIT
Index (“RMS”) for the following periods ended December 31, 2014:

(1) Past
  performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance.

We intend to achieve our business objective by
continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and execute our operating
strategies through:

·

Maintaining a
superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial
spirit

·

Investing in
properties in select markets, such as New York City and
Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital
appreciation

·

Acquiring
quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a
significant potential for higher rents

·

Investing in
retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City
metropolitan area

·

Developing and
redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value

·

Investing in
operating companies that have a significant real estate component

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and
investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset
sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets.  We may also
offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in
exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire our securities
in the future.

We compete with a large number of property owners
and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their
investments than we are. Principal factors of competition include rents
charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property
and the breadth and the quality of services provided.  See “Risk Factors” in
Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.

Acquisitions

On
June 26, 2014, we invested an additional $22,700,000 to increase our ownership
in One Park Avenue to 55.0% from 46.5% through a joint venture with an
institutional investor, who increased its ownership interest to 45.0%.  The
transaction was based on a property value of $560,000,000.  The property is
encumbered by a $250,000,000 interest-only mortgage loan that bears interest at
4.995% and matures in March 2016.

On July 23, 2014, a
joint venture in which we are a 50.1% partner entered into a 99-year ground
lease for 61 Ninth Avenue located on the Southwest corner of Ninth Avenue and

th

Street in Manhattan.  The venture’s current plans are to
construct an office building, with retail at the base, of approximately 130,000
square feet.  Total development costs are currently estimated to be approximately
$125,000,000.

On August 1, 2014, we
acquired the land under our 715 Lexington Avenue retail property located on the
Southeast corner of 58

th

Street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan,
for $63,000,000.

On October 28, 2014

, we completed the purchase of the retail
condominium of the St. Regis Hotel for $700,000,000.  We own a 74.3%
controlling interest of the joint venture which owns the property. The
acquisition was used in a like-kind exchange for income tax purposes for the
sale of 1740 Broadway (see below).  We consolidate the accounts of the venture
into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

On November 21, 2014,
we entered into an agreement to acquire the Center Building, an eight story
437,000 square foot office building, located at 33-00 Northern Boulevard in
Long Island City, New York.  The building is 98% leased.  The purchase price is
approximately $142,000,000, including the assumption of an existing $62,000,000
4.43% mortgage maturing in October 2018.  The purchase is expected to close in
the first quarter of 2015, subject to customary closing conditions.  As of
December 31, 2014, our $14,200,000 non-refundable deposit was included in
“other assets” on our consolidated balance sheet.

On January
20, 2015, we co-invested with our 25% owned Fund and one of the Fund’s limited
partners to buy out the Fund’s joint venture partner’s 57% interest in the
Crowne Plaza Times Square Hotel.  The purchase price for the 57% interest
was approximately $95,000,000 (our share $39,000,000) which valued the property
at approximately $480,000,000.  The property is encumbered by a newly placed
$310,000,000 mortgage loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.80% and maturing in
December 2018 with a one-year extension option.   Our aggregate ownership
interest in the property increased to 33% from 11%.

Dispositions

New York

On December 18,
2014, we completed the sale of 1740 Broadway, a 601,000 square foot office
building in Manhattan for $605,000,000.  The sale resulted in net proceeds of
approximately $580,000,000, after closing costs, and resulted in a financial
statement gain of approximately $441,000,000.  The tax gain of approximately
$484,000,000, was deferred in like-kind exchanges, primarily for the
acquisition of the St. Regis Fifth Avenue retail.

Retail Properties

On February
24, 2014, we completed the sale of Broadway Mall in Hicksville, Long Island,
New York, for $94,000,000.  The sale resulted in net proceeds of $92,174,000
after closing costs.

On March 2, 2014,
we entered into an agreement to transfer upon completion, the redeveloped
Springfield Town Center, a 1,350,000 square foot mall located in Springfield,
Fairfax County, Virginia, to Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (NYSE:
PEI) (“PREIT”) in exchange for $465,000,000 comprised of $340,000,000 of cash
and $125,000,000 of PREIT operating partnership units.  In connection
therewith, we recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $20,000,000 in the first
quarter of 2014, which is included in “income from discontinued operations” on
our consolidated statements of income. The redevelopment was substantially completed
in October 2014, at which time we reclassified the assets, liabilities and
financial results to discontinued operations, and the transfer of the property
to PREIT is expected to be completed no later than March 31, 2015.

On July 8, 2014,
we completed the sale of Beverly Connection, a 335,000 square foot power
shopping center in Los Angeles, California, for $260,000,000, of which
$239,000,000 was cash and $21,000,000 was 10-year mezzanine seller financing. 
The sale resulted in a net gain of $44,155,000, which was recognized in the
third quarter of 2014.

In addition
to the above, during 2014, we sold six of the 22 strip shopping centers which
did not fit UE’s strategy, in separate transactions, for an aggregate of
$66,410,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain aggregating $22,500,000.

Financings

Secured Debt

On January 31, 2014, we completed a $600,000,000
loan secured by our 220 Central Park South development site.  The loan bears
interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% (2.92% at December 31, 2014) and matures in
January 2016, with three one-year extension options.

On April 16,

2014, we completed a
$350,000,000 refinancing of 909 Third Avenue, a 1.3 million square foot
Manhattan office building.  The seven-year interest only loan bears interest at
3.91% and matures in May 2021. We realized net proceeds of approximately $145,000,000
after defeasing the existing 5.64%, $193,000,000 mortgage, defeasance cost and
other closing costs.

On July 16, 2014, we completed a $130,000,000
financing of Las Catalinas, a 494,000 square foot mall located in the San Juan
area of Puerto Rico. The 10-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 4.43% and
matures in August 2024.  The loan amortizes based on a 30-year schedule
beginning in year six.

On August 12, 2014, we completed a $185,000,000
financing of the Universal buildings, a 690,000 square foot, two-building
office complex located in Washington, DC. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus
1.90% (2.06% at December 31, 2014) and matures in August 2019 with two one-year
extension options. The loan amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in
the fourth year.

On August 26, 2014, we obtained a standby commitment
for up to $500,000,000 of five-year mezzanine loan financing to fund a portion
of the development expenditures at 220 Central Park South.

On October 27,
2014, we completed a $140,000,000 financing of 655 Fifth Avenue, a 57,500
square foot retail and office property.  The loan is interest only at LIBOR
plus 1.40% (1.56% at December 31, 2014) and matures in October 2019 with two
one-year extension options.

On December 8, 2014, we completed a $575,000,000
refinancing of Two Penn Plaza, a 1.6 million square foot Manhattan office
building.  The loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.65% (1.81% at December 31,
2014) and matures in 2019 with two one-year extension options.  We realized net
proceeds of approximately $143,000,000.  Pursuant to an existing swap
agreement, the $422,000,000 previous loan on the property was swapped to a
fixed rate of 4.78% through March 2018.  Therefore, $422,000,000 of the new
loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.78% through March 2018 and the balance
of $153,000,000 floats through March 2018.  The entire $575,000,000 will float
thereafter for the duration of the new loan.

On January 6, 2015, we completed the
modification of the $120,000,000, 6.04% mortgage loan secured by our
Montehiedra Town Center, in the San Juan area of Puerto Rico.  The loan has
been extended from July 2016 to July 2021 and separated into two tranches, a
senior $90,000,000 position with interest at 5.33% to be paid currently, and a
junior $30,000,000 position with interest accruing at 3%.  Montehiedra Town
Center and the loan were included in the spin-off to UE on January 15, 2015. 
As part of the planned redevelopment of the property, UE is committed to fund $20,000,000
through a loan for leasing and building capital expenditures of which
$8,000,000 has been funded.  This loan is senior to the $30,000,000 position
noted above and accrues interest at 10%.

Senior Unsecured Notes

On June 16, 2014, we completed a green bond
public offering of $450,000,000 2.50% senior unsecured notes due June 30, 2019.
The notes were sold at 99.619% of their face amount to yield 2.581%.

On October 1, 2014, we redeemed all of the
$445,000,000 principal amount of our outstanding 7.875% senior unsecured notes,
which were scheduled to mature on October 1, 2039, at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest through the redemption date. 
In the fourth quarter of 2014, we wrote off $12,532,000 of unamortized deferred
financing costs, which are included as a component of “interest and debt
expense” on our consolidated statements of income.

On January 1, 2015, we redeemed all of the
$500,000,000 principal amount of our outstanding 4.25% senior unsecured notes,
which were scheduled to mature on April 1, 2015, at a redemption price of 100%
of the principal amount plus accrued interest through December 31, 2014.

Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility

On September 30, 2014, we extended one of our two
$1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities from November 2015 to
November 2018 with two six-month extension options.  The interest rate on the
extended facility was lowered to LIBOR plus 105 basis points from LIBOR plus
125 basis points and the facility fee was reduced to 20 basis points from 25
basis points.

Due to the effects of BRAC related move-outs and the
sluggish leasing environment in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area,
EBITDA from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 was
lower than 2012 by $14,254,000 and EBITDA from continuing operations for the
year ended December 31, 2014 was lower than 2013 by $5,633,000, which was
offset by an interest expense reduction of $18,568,000 from the restructuring
of the Skyline properties mortgage loan in October 2013.  We expect 2015 EBITDA
from continuing operations will be flat to 2014.


Critical
Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements
we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the
accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements.  The summary should be read in conjunction
with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2
to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Real Estate

Real estate is
carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Betterments,
major renewals and certain costs directly related to the improvement and
leasing of real estate are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as
incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book
value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the
construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are
capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed
the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete. If the cost
of the redeveloped property, including the net book value of the existing
property, exceeds the estimated fair value of redeveloped property, the excess
is charged to expense. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over
estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40 years. Tenant allowances are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which
approximate the useful lives of the assets.

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess
the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements,
identified intangibles, such as acquired above and below-market leases,
acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and
we allocate the purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value
based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and
capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future
cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating
results, known trends, and market/economic conditions.  We record acquired
intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases, acquired in-place
leases and tenant relationships) and acquired intangible liabilities (including
below–market leases) at their estimated fair value separate and apart from
goodwill. We amortize identified intangibles that have finite lives over the
period they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future
cash flows of the property or business acquired.

As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the carrying
amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $15.2 billion and
$14.1 billion, respectively.  As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the carrying
amounts of identified intangible assets (including acquired above-market
leases, tenant relationships and acquired in-place leases) were $276,239,000 and
$307,436,000, respectively, and the carrying amounts of identified intangible
liabilities, a component of “deferred revenue” on our consolidated balance
sheets, were $488,868,000 and $496,489,000, respectively.

Our properties, including any related intangible
assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An
impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate
projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an
undiscounted basis.  An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the
property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses
are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information
at the time the analyses are prepared.  If our estimates of the projected
future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change,
our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could
be material to our consolidated financial statements.  The evaluation of
anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions
regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could
differ materially from actual results.  Plans to hold properties over longer
periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.


Critical
Accounting Policies – continued

Partially Owned Entities

We consolidate entities in which we have a
controlling financial interest.  In determining whether we have a controlling
financial interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to
consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership
interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make
decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the
partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity
(“VIE”) and we are the primary beneficiary.  We are deemed to be the primary
beneficiary of a VIE when we have (i) the power to direct the activities of the
VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the
obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be
significant to the VIE. We generally do not control a partially owned entity if
the entity is not considered a VIE and the approval of all of the
partners/members is contractually required with respect to major decisions,
such as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange or other disposition
of real property, the hiring of a chief executive officer, the commencement,
compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or arbitration or the
placement of new or additional financing secured by assets of the venture.  We
account for investments under the equity method when the requirements for
consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the
operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at
cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash
contributions and distributions each period. Investments that do not qualify
for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost
method.

Investments in partially owned entities are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is
measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its
estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended
holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared. 
The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is
dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment
and market conditions.  If our estimates of the projected future cash flows,
the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities
are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on
market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be
different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial
statements.  The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is
based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and
capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.

As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the carrying
amounts of investments in partially owned entities, including Toys “R” Us, was $1.2
billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.

Mortgage and Mezzanine Loans Receivable

We invest in mortgage and mezzanine loans of
entities that have significant real estate assets.  These investments are
either secured by the real property or by pledges of the equity interests of
the entities owning the underlying real estate.  We record these investments at
the stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium. We
accrete or amortize any discount or premium over the life of the related
receivable utilizing the effective interest method or straight-line method, if
the result is not materially different.  We evaluate the collectibility of both
interest and principal of each of our loans whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate such amounts may not be recoverable. A loan is impaired
when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according
to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the
loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment
to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s
effective interest rate, or as a practical expedient, to the value of the
collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  Interest on impaired loans is
recognized when received in cash.  If our estimates of the collectability of both
interest and principal or the fair value of our loans change based on market
conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different
and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial
statements.

As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the carrying
amounts of mortgage and mezzanine loans receivable were $16,748,000 and $170,972,000,
respectively, net of an allowance of $5,811,000 and $5,845,000, respectively,
and are included in “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets.

Allowance For Doubtful Accounts

We periodically evaluate the collectability of
amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts ($17,060,000
and $21,869,000 as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively) for estimated
losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under
the lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising
from the straight-lining of rents ($3,188,000 and $4,355,000 as of December 31,
2014 and 2013, respectively). This receivable arises from earnings recognized
in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management
exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history
and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may
differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated
financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

We have the following revenue sources and revenue
recognition policies:

·

Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized
over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis
which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases. 
We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the
leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. 
In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance
for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a
reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease.

·

Percentage Rent — income arising from retail tenant leases that is
contingent upon tenant sales exceeding defined thresholds. These rents are
recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., when tenant sales
thresholds have been achieved).

·

Hotel Revenue — income arising from the operation of the Hotel
Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and
banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and
beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been
rendered.

·

Trade Shows Revenue — income arising from the operation of trade shows,
including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows
have occurred.

·

Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide
for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate
taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods
as the expenses are incurred.

·

Management, Leasing and Other Fees — income arising from contractual
agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is
recognized as the related services are performed under the respective
agreements.

·

Cleveland Medical Mart — revenue arising from the development of
the Cleveland Medical Mart.  This revenue was recognized as the related
services were performed under the respective agreements using the criteria set
forth in ASC 605-25,

Multiple Element Arrangements.

Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among
other things, its collectibility. If our assessment of the collectibility of
revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be
material.

Income Taxes

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to
continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) under Sections
856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections,
a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to
its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be
taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its
shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income and
therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.  If we fail to
distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, or fail to meet
other REIT requirements, we may fail to qualify as a REIT which may result in
substantial adverse tax consequences.

Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Years Ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 - continued

Notes to preceding tabular information:

(1)

EBITDA represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization." We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)

Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax expense (benefit) in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these items from partially owned entities.

On June 7, 2013, we sold an 8.65% economic interest in our
  investment of Independence Plaza, which reduced our economic interest to
  50.1%.  As a result, we determined that we were no longer the primary
  beneficiary of the VIE and accordingly, we deconsolidated the operations of
  the property on June 7, 2013 and began accounting for our investment under
  the equity method.

Due to the completion of the project.  This decrease in revenue
  is substantially offset by a decrease in development costs expensed in the
  period.  See note (4) on page 57.

(Loss) Applicable to Toys

We account for Toys on the equity method, which means our investment is increased or decreased for our pro rata share of Toys undistributed net income or loss.

We have not guaranteed any of Toys’ obligations and are not committed to provide any support to Toys.  Pursuant to ASC 323-10-35-20, we discontinued applying the equity method for our Toys’ investment when the carrying amount was reduced to zero in the third quarter of 2014.  We will resume application of the equity method if during the period the equity method was suspended our share of unrecognized net income exceeds our share of unrecognized net losses.

In the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized a net loss of $73,556,000 from our investment in Toys, comprised of (i) $4,691,000 for our share of Toys’ net loss and a (ii) $75,196,000 non-cash impairment loss, partially offset by (iii) $6,331,000 of management fee income.  In the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized a net loss of $362,377,000 from our investment in Toys, comprised of (i) $128,919,000 for our share of Toys’ net loss and (ii) $240,757,000 non-cash impairment losses, partially offset by (iii) $7,299,000 of management fee income.

In the first quarter of 2013, we recognized our share of Toys’ fourth quarter net income of $78,542,000 and a corresponding non-cash impairment loss of the same amount to continue to carry our investment at fair value.

At December 31, 2013, we estimated that the fair value of our investment in Toys was approximately $80,062,000 ($83,224,000 including $3,162,000 for our share of Toys’ accumulated other comprehensive income), or $162,215,000 less than the carrying amount after recognizing our share of Toys’ third quarter net loss in our fourth quarter.  In determining the fair value of our investment, we considered, among other inputs, a December 31, 2013 third-party valuation of Toys.  As of December 31, 2013, we have concluded that the decline in the value of our investment was “other-than-temporary” based on, among other factors, Toys’ 2013 holiday sales results, compression of earnings multiples of comparable retailers and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near term.  Accordingly, we recognized an additional non-cash impairment loss of $162,215,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013.

In the first quarter of 2014, we recognized our share of Toys’ fourth quarter net income of $75,196,000 and a corresponding non-cash impairment loss of the same amount to continue to carry our investment at fair value.

a decrease of $13,589,000. This decrease was primarily due to (i) $20,483,000 of higher capitalized interest and debt expense and (ii) $18,568,000 of interest savings from the restructuring of the Skyline properties mortgage loan in the fourth quarter of 2013, partially offset by (iii) $13,287,000 of interest expense from the $600,000,000 financing of our 220 Central Park South development site in January 2014, (iv) $6,265,000 of interest expense from the issuance of the $450,000,000 unsecured notes in June 2014, and (v) $5,589,000 of defeasance cost in connection with the refinancing of 909 Third Avenue.

partially offset

by a $54,914,000

net loss on sale of J.C. Penney common shares.

Income Tax (Expense) Benefit

In the year ended December 31, 2014, we had an income tax expense of $11,002,000, compared to a benefit of $6,406,000 in the prior year, an increase in expense of $17,408,000.  This increase resulted primarily from a reversal of previously accrued deferred tax liabilities in the prior year due to a change in the effective tax rate resulting from an amendment of the Washington, DC Unincorporated Business Tax Statute.

Same Store EBITDA

Same store EBITDA represents EBITDA from property
level operations which are owned by us in both the current and prior year
reporting periods.  Same store EBITDA excludes segment-level overhead expenses,
which are expenses that we do not consider to be property-level expenses, as
well as other non-operating items.  We also present same store EBITDA on a cash
basis (which excludes income from the straight-lining of rents, amortization of
below-market leases, net of above-market leases and other non-cash adjustments). 
We present these non-GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of
the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions
on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the
performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers.  Same store
EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow
from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed
by other companies.

Below is the reconciliation of EBITDA to same

(Loss) Income Applicable to Toys

In the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized a net loss of $362,377,000 from our investment in Toys, comprised of (i) $128,919,000 for our share of Toys’ net loss and (ii) $240,757,000 non-cash impairment losses, partially offset by (iii) $7,299,000 of management fee income.  In the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized net income of $14,859,000 from our investment in Toys, comprised of (i) $45,267,000 for our share of Toys’ net income and (ii) $9,592,000 of management fee income, partially offset by a (iii) $40,000,000 non-cash impairment loss.

At

December 31, 2012, we estimated that the fair value of our investment was $40,000,000 less than the carrying amount of $518,041,000 and concluded that the decline in the value of our investment was “other-than-temporary” based on, among other factors, compression of earnings multiples of comparable retailers and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near term.  Accordingly, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $40,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2012.

In the first quarter of 2013, we recognized our share of Toys’ fourth quarter net income of $78,542,000 and a corresponding non-cash impairment loss of the same amount to continue to carry our investment at fair value.

At December 31, 2013, we estimated that the fair value of our investment in Toys was approximately $80,062,000 ($83,224,000 including $3,162,000 for our share of Toys’ accumulated other comprehensive income), or $162,215,000 less than the carrying amount after recognizing our share of Toys’ third quarter net loss in our fourth quarter.  In determining the fair value of our investment, we considered, among other inputs, a December 31, 2013 third-party valuation of Toys.  As of December 31, 2013, we have concluded that the decline in the value of our investment was “other-than-temporary” based on, among other factors, Toys’ 2013 holiday sales results, compression of earnings multiples of comparable retailers and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near term.  Accordingly, we recognized an additional non-cash impairment loss of $162,215,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013.

in July 2012 and $300,000,000 of 5.40% Series L cumulative redeemable preferred

Notes to preceding tabular information:

New York:

The
$41,673,000 increase in New York same store EBITDA resulted primarily from
increases in Office and Retail of $29,693,000 and $9,229,000, respectively. 
The Office increase resulted primarily from higher (i) rental revenue of $13,983,000
(primarily due to a $1.85 increase in average annual rents per square foot) and
(ii) signage revenue and management and leasing fees of $16,037,000. The Retail
increase resulted primarily from higher rental revenue of $10,414,000,
(primarily due to a $9.35 increase in average annual rents per square foot).

Washington, DC:

The
$10,323,000 decrease in Washington, DC same store EBITDA resulted primarily
from lower rental revenue of $15,267,000, primarily due to a 330 basis point
decrease in office average same store occupancy to 82.8% from 86.1%, a
significant portion of which resulted from the effects of BRAC related
move-outs and the sluggish leasing environment in the Washington, DC / Northern
Virginia area (see page 47 for details).

Retail Properties:

The
$2,493,000 increase in Retail Properties same store EBITDA resulted primarily
from higher rental revenue of $2,847,000, due to a 70 basis point increase in
average same store occupancy to 94.2% from 93.5%, and a $0.23 increase in
average annual rents per square foot.

Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 - continued

Notes to preceding tabular information:

(1)

EBITDA represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization." We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)

Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax expense (benefit) in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these items from partially owned entities.

Same Store
EBITDA

Same store EBITDA represents EBITDA from property
level operations which are owned by us in both the current and prior year
reporting periods.  Same store EBITDA excludes segment-level overhead expenses,
which are expenses that we do not consider to be property-level expenses, as
well as other non-operating items.  We also present same store EBITDA on a cash
basis (which excludes income from the straight-lining of rents, amortization of
below-market leases, net of above-market leases and other non-cash adjustments). 
We present these non-GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of
the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions
on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the
performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers.  Same store
EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow
from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed
by other companies.

Below is the reconciliation of EBITDA to same
store EBITDA for each of our segments for the three months ended December 31,
2014, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2013.

Interstate and its partners beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately
6.6% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 26.3% of
Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of
Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual
fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent.  The management
agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless
terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term. 
We believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies,
that the management agreement terms are fair to us.  We earned $535,000,
$606,000, and $794,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years
ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

On January 15, 2015, we completed the spin-off of
79 strip shopping centers, three malls, a warehouse park and $225,000,000 of
cash to UE and the transfer of all of the employees responsible for the
management and leasing of those assets.   In addition, we entered into
agreements with UE to provide management and leasing services, on our behalf,
for Interstate’s properties.   Fees for these services are similar to the fees
we are receiving from Interstate described above.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Property rental income is our primary
source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our
properties. Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital
improvements, tenant improvements, debt service, leasing commissions, dividends
to shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership,
as well as acquisition and development costs.    Other sources of liquidity to
fund cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including
mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, and our revolving credit
facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity; and
asset sales.

We anticipate that cash flow from
continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our
business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating
Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring
capital expenditures.  Capital requirements for development expenditures and
acquisitions may require funding from borrowings and/or equity offerings.

We may from time to time purchase or
retire outstanding debt securities.  Such purchases, if any, will depend on
prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors.  The
amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our
consolidated financial statements.

Dividends

On January 21, 2015, we declared a
quarterly common dividend of $0.63 per share (an indicated annual rate of $2.52
per common share).  This dividend, if continued for all of 2015, would require
us to pay out approximately $474,000,000 of cash for common share dividends. 
In addition, during 2015, we expect to pay approximately $82,000,000 of cash
dividends on outstanding preferred shares and approximately $29,000,000 of cash
distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership.

Financing
Activities and Contractual Obligations

We have an effective shelf registration
for the offering of our equity and debt securities that is not limited in
amount due to our status as a “well-known seasoned issuer.”  We have issued
senior unsecured notes from a shelf registration statement that contain
financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt, and that require
us to maintain a level of unencumbered assets based on the level of our secured
debt.  Our revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require
us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market
capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a
decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB.  Our revolving credit facilities also
contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations
and warranties, and contain customary events of default that could give rise to
accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or
principal.  As of December 31, 2014, we are in compliance with all of the
financial covenants required by our senior unsecured notes and our revolving
credit facilities.

As of December 31, 2014, we had $1,198,477,000 of
cash and cash equivalents and $2,460,448,000 of borrowing capacity under our
revolving credit facilities, net of outstanding borrowings and letters of
credit of $0 and $39,552,000, respectively.  A summary of our consolidated debt
as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 is presented below.

depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other
factors.  The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be
material to our consolidated financial statements.

Details of 2014 financing activities are provided
in the “Overview” of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Conditions and Results of Operations.  Details of 2013 financing activities are
discussed below.

Secured Debt

On
February 20, 2013, we completed a $390,000,000 financing of the retail
condominium located at 666 Fifth Avenue at 53

rd

Street, which we had
acquired in December 2012.  The 10-year fixed-rate interest only loan bears
interest at 3.61%.  This property was previously unencumbered.  The net
proceeds from this financing were approximately $387,000,000.

On
March 25, 2013, we completed a $300,000,000 financing of the Outlets at Bergen
Town Center, a 948,000 square foot shopping center located in Paramus, New
Jersey.  The 10-year fixed-rate interest only loan bears interest at 3.56%. 
The property was previously encumbered by a $282,312,000 floating-rate loan.

On
June 7, 2013, we completed a $550,000,000 refinancing of Independence Plaza, a
three-building 1,328 unit residential complex in the Tribeca submarket of
Manhattan.  The five-year fixed-rate interest only mortgage loan bears interest
at 3.48%.  The property was previously encumbered by a $323,000,000
floating-rate loan.  The net proceeds of $219,000,000, after repaying the
existing loan and closing costs, were distributed to the partners, of which our
share was $137,000,000.

On October 30, 2013, we
completed the restructuring of the $678,000,000 (face amount) 5.74% Skyline
properties mortgage loan. The loan was separated into two tranches; a senior
$350,000,000 position and a junior $328,000,000 position. The maturity date has
been extended from February 2017 to February 2022, with a one-year extension
option. The effective interest rate is 2.965%. Amounts expended to re-lease the
property are senior to the $328,000,000 junior position.

On November 27, 2013, we
completed a $450,000,000 refinancing of Eleven Penn Plaza, a 1.1 million square
foot Manhattan office building.  The seven-year fixed-rate interest only loan
bears interest at 3.95%. The net proceeds from this refinancing were
approximately $107,000,000 after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.

Unsecured
Revolving Credit Facility

On
March 28, 2013, we extended one of our two $1.25 billion revolving credit
facilities from June 2015 to June 2017, with two six-month extension options. The
interest on the extended facility was reduced from LIBOR plus 135 basis points
to LIBOR plus 115 basis points. In addition, the facility fee was reduced from
30 basis points to 20 basis points.

Preferred
Securities

On January 25, 2013, we sold 12,000,000 5.40%
Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at a price of
$25.00 per share in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an
effective registration statement.  We retained aggregate net proceeds of
$290,306,000, after underwriters’ discounts and issuance costs, and contributed
the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 12,000,000 Series
L Preferred Units (with economic terms that mirror those of the Series L
Preferred Shares).

On February 19, 2013, we redeemed all of the
outstanding 6.75% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares and
6.75% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at par,
for an aggregate of $262,500,000 in cash, plus accrued and unpaid dividends
through the date of redemption.

On May 9, 2013, we redeemed all of the
outstanding 6.875% Series D-15 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units with an
aggregate face amount of $45,000,000 for $36,900,000 in cash, plus accrued and
unpaid distributions through the date of redemption.

Acquisitions and Investments

Details of 2014
acquisitions and investments are provided in the “Overview” of Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. 
Details of 2013 acquisitions and investments are discussed below.

650 Madison Avenue

On September 30, 2013, a joint venture, in which we
have a 20.1% interest, acquired 650 Madison Avenue, a 27-story, 594,000 square
foot Class A office and retail tower located on Madison Avenue between 59th and
60th Street, for $1.295 billion.  The property contains 523,000 square feet of
office space and 71,000 square feet of retail space.  The purchase price was
funded with cash and a new $800,000,000 seven-year 4.39% interest-only loan.

655 Fifth Avenue

On October
4, 2013, we acquired a 92.5% interest in 655 Fifth Avenue, a 57,500 square foot
retail and office property located at the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and
52nd Street in Manhattan, for $277,500,000 in cash.

220 Central Park South

On October
15, 2013, we acquired, for $194,000,000 in cash, land and air rights for
137,000 zoning square feet thereby completing the assemblage for our 220
Central Park South development site in Manhattan.

Other

Development
and Redevelopment Expenditures

On March 2,
2014, we entered into an agreement to transfer upon completion, the redeveloped
Springfield Town Center, a 1,350,000 square foot mall located in Springfield,
Fairfax County, Virginia, to Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (NYSE:
PEI) (“PREIT’) in exchange for $465,000,000 comprised of $340,000,000 of cash
and $125,000,000 of PREIT operating partnership units. The incremental
development cost of this project was approximately $250,000,000, of which $225,000,000
has been expended as of December 31, 2014. The redevelopment was substantially completed
in October 2014 and the transfer of the property to PREIT is expected to be completed
no later than March 31, 2015.

We are in the
process of redeveloping and substantially expanding the existing retail space
at the Marriott Marquis Times Square Hotel, including converting the below
grade parking garage into retail, which is expected to be completed by the end
of 2015.  Upon completion of the redevelopment, the retail space will include
20,000 square feet on grade and 20,000 square feet below grade.  As part of the
redevelopment, we have completed the construction of a six-story, 300 foot wide
block front, dynamic LED sign, which was lit for the first time in November
2014. The incremental development cost of this project is approximately
$220,000,000, of which $170,000,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2014.

We are
constructing a residential condominium tower containing 472,000 zoning square
feet on our 220 Central Park South development site. The incremental
development cost of this project is approximately $1.0 billion, of which
$94,000,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2014. In January 2014, we
completed a $600,000,000 loan secured by this site. On August 26, 2014, we
obtained a standby commitment for up to $500,000,000 of five-year mezzanine
loan financing to fund a portion of the development expenditures at 220 Central
Park South.

We are
developing The Bartlett, a 699-unit residential project in Pentagon City, which
is expected to be completed in 2016. The project will include a 37,000 square
foot Whole Foods Market at the base of the building. The incremental
development cost of this project is approximately $250,000,000, of which
$49,000,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2014.

We plan to
redevelop an existing 165,000 square foot office building in Crystal City (2221
S. Clark Street), which we have leased to WeWork, into approximately 250 rental
residential units. The incremental development cost of this project is approximately
$40,000,000. The redevelopment is expected to be completed in the second half
of 2015.

We are in the
process of repositioning and re-tenanting 280 Park Avenue (50% owned). Our
share of the incremental development cost of this project is approximately
$62,000,000, of which $34,700,000 was expended prior to 2014, and $22,000,000 has
been expended in 2014.

We are also
evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our
properties in Manhattan, including the Penn Plaza District, and in Washington,
including 1900 Crystal Drive, Rosslyn and Pentagon City.

There can be no
assurance that any of our development or redevelopment projects will commence,
or if commenced, be completed, or completed on schedule or within budget.


Liquidity and Capital Resources – continued

Insurance

We maintain
general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all
risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence,
with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods.  Our California properties
have earthquake insurance with coverage of $180,000,000 per occurrence, subject
to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, up
to a $180,000,000 annual aggregate. We maintain coverage for terrorism acts
with limits of $4.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate, and $2.0
billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism involving nuclear,
biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) terrorism events, as defined by
Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, which expires in December
2020.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our
wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a
portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our
earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for NBCR
acts.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured
by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure
to PPIC.  For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and
15% of the balance of a covered loss (16% effective January 1, 2016) and the
Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of a covered loss (84%
effective January 1, 2016).  We are ultimately responsible for any loss
incurred by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance
market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we
cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable
terms in the future.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans
secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes
and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to
maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance
coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an
equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if
lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could
adversely affect our ability to finance our properties and expand our
portfolio.

Other
Commitments and Contingencies

We are from time to time involved in legal actions
arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation
with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters is not expected to have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying
degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental
assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However,
there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of
contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the
discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not
result in significant costs to us.

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us.  However,
in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space. 
These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of
specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans.  As of December
31, 2014, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is
approximately $359,000,000.

At December 31, 2014, $39,552,000 of letters of
credit were outstanding under one of our revolving credit facilities.  Our
revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to
maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization
ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our
ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our revolving credit facilities also contain customary
conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties,
and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to
accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or
principal.

As of December 31, 2014, we expect to fund
additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating
approximately $104,000,000.

Capital expenditures consist of expenditures to
maintain assets, tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions. 
Recurring capital expenditures include expenditures to maintain a property’s
competitive position within the market and tenant improvements and leasing
commissions necessary to re-lease expiring leases or renew or extend existing
leases.  Non-recurring capital improvements include expenditures to lease space
that has been vacant for more than nine months and expenditures completed in
the year of acquisition and the following two years that were planned at the
time of acquisition, as well as tenant improvements and leasing commissions for
space that was vacant at the time of acquisition of a property.

Funds From Operations (“FFO”)

FFO is computed in
accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”).  NAREIT
defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales
of depreciated real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation
and amortization expense from real estate assets, extraordinary items and other
specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of
unconsolidated subsidiaries.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by
management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of
operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes
the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales,
which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of
real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on
existing market conditions.  FFO does not represent cash generated from
operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to
fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net
income as a performance measure or cash flows as a liquidity measure.  FFO may
not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

FFO attributable to common shareholders plus
assumed conversions was $911,130,000, or $4.83 per diluted share for the year
ended December 31, 2014, compared to $641,037,000, or $3.41 per diluted share
for the year ended December 31, 2013. FFO attributable to common shareholders
plus assumed conversions was a positive $230,143,000, or $1.22 per diluted
share for the three months ended December 31, 2014, compared to a negative
$6,784,000, or $0.04 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2013. 
Details of certain items that affect comparability are discussed in the
financial results summary of our “Overview.”

ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We have exposure to fluctuations in market
interest rates. Market interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are
beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest rates on our
consolidated and non-consolidated debt (all of which arises out of non-trading
activity) is as follows:

We may utilize various financial instruments to
mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and
earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the
interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. As of
December 31, 2014, we have one interest rate cap with a principal amount of
$60,000,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.36%.  This cap is based
on a notional amount of $60,000,000 and caps LIBOR at a rate of 7.00%.  In
addition, we have one interest rate swap on a $422,000,000 mortgage loan that
swapped the rate from LIBOR plus 1.65% (1.81% at December 31, 2014) to a fixed
rate of 4.78% through March 2018.

Fair Value of Debt

The estimated fair value of our consolidated
debt is calculated based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at
the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar
credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt.  As of December 31, 2014,
the estimated fair value of our consolidated debt was $10,936,000,000.

the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement
schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial
statement schedules based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Vornado Realty Trust at December
31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
February 17, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting.

VORNADO REALTY TRUST

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.     Organization and Business

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”).  Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors.  Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 94.1% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2014.  All references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership.

On January 15, 2015, we completed the spin-off of substantially all of our retail segment comprised of 79 strip shopping centers, three malls, a warehouse park and $225 million of cash to Urban Edge Properties (“UE”) (NYSE: UE).  As part of this transaction, we received 5,712,000 UE operating partnership units (5.4% ownership interest).  We are providing transition services to UE for an initial period of up to two years, including information technology, human resources, tax and public reporting.  UE is providing us with leasing and property management services for (i) the Monmouth Mall, (ii) certain small retail properties which did not fit UE’s strategy that we plan to sell, and (iii) our affiliate, Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX), Rego Park retail assets.  Steven Roth, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Board of Trustees of UE.  The spin-off distribution was effected by Vornado distributing one UE common share for every two Vornado common shares.  Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, the historical financial results of UE will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

We currently own all or portions of:

New York:

·

20.1 million square feet of Manhattan office space in 31 properties;

·

2.5 million square feet of Manhattan street retail space in 56 properties;

·

Four residential properties containing 1,654 units;

·

The 1,700 room Hotel Pennsylvania located on Seventh Avenue at 33

rd

Washington, DC:

·

16.1 million square feet of office space in 59 properties;

·

Seven residential properties containing 2,414

Accounting Policies

Basis of
Presentation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vornado
and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership. All
inter-company amounts have been eliminated.  Our consolidated financial
statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting
Literature

In April 2014,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an update (“ASU
2014-08”)

Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of
Components of an Entity

to ASC Topic 205,

Presentation of Financial
Statements

and ASC Topic 360,

Property Plant and Equipment.

Under
ASU 2014-08, only disposals that represent a strategic shift that has (or will
have) a major effect on the entity’s results and operations would qualify as
discontinued operations.  In addition, ASU 2014-08 expands the disclosure
requirements for disposals that meet the definition of a discontinued operation
and requires entities to disclose information about disposals of individually
significant components that do not meet the definition of discontinued
operations.  ASU 2014-08 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods
in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2014.  Upon adoption of this
standard, individual properties sold in the ordinary course of business are not
expected to qualify as discontinued operations.  The financial results of our
strip shopping centers and malls, which were spun off to UE on January 15,
2015, will be treated as a discontinued operation in the first quarter of 2015.

In May 2014,
the FASB issued an update ("ASU 2014-09") establishing ASC Topic 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

ASU 2014-09 establishes a single
comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from
contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue
recognition guidance.  ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue when
it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for
those goods or services and also requires certain additional disclosures.  ASU 2014-09
is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that
begin after December 15, 2016.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the
adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2014, the FASB issued an update (“ASU 2014-12”) to
ASC Topic 718,

Compensation – Stock Compensation

.  ASU 2014-12 requires
an entity to treat performance targets that can be met after the requisite
service period of a share based award has ended, as a performance condition
that affects vesting.  ASU 2014-12 is effective for interim and annual
reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2015.  We are
currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-12 on our
consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Policies - continued

Significant
Accounting Policies

Real
Estate:

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly
related to the improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized.
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. For redevelopment of existing
operating properties, the net book value of the existing property under
redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in
connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized
costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped
property when complete. If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the
net book value of the existing property, exceeds the estimated fair value of
redeveloped property, the excess is charged to expense. Depreciation is recognized
on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40
years. Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives
of the related leases, which approximate the useful lives of the assets.
Additions to real estate include interest and debt expense capitalized during
construction of $62,786,000 and $42,303,000 for the years ended December 31,
2014 and 2013, respectively.

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess
the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements,
identified intangibles, such as acquired above and below-market leases, acquired
in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and we
allocate the purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value
based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and
capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future
cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating
results, known trends, and market/economic conditions.  We record acquired
intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases, acquired in-place
leases and tenant relationships) and acquired intangible liabilities (including
below–market leases) at their estimated fair value separate and apart from
goodwill. We amortize identified intangibles that have finite lives over the
period they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash
flows of the property or business acquired.

Our properties, including any related intangible
assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists
when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future
cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis.  An
impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying
amount over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on our
current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the
time the analyses are prepared.  If our estimates of the projected future cash
flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change, our evaluation
of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to
our consolidated financial statements.  The evaluation of anticipated cash
flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future
occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially
from actual results.  Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the
likelihood of recording impairment losses.

The table below summarizes impairment losses,
acquisition related costs and tenant buy-outs in the years ended December 31,
2014, 2013 and 2012.

VORNADO REALTY TRUST

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

2.   
Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies – continued

Partially Owned Entities:

We
consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest.  In
determining whether we have a controlling financial interest in a partially
owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we
consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management
representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive
participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a
variable interest entity (“VIE”) and we are the primary beneficiary.  We are
deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have (i) the power to
direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s
economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive
benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We generally do not
control a partially owned entity if the entity is not considered a VIE and the
approval of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect
to major decisions, such as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange
or other disposition of real property, the hiring of a chief executive officer,
the commencement, compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or
arbitration or the placement of new or additional financing secured by assets
of the venture.  We account for investments under the equity method when the
requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence
over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially
recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss
and cash contributions and distributions each period. Investments that do not
qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the
cost method.

Investments in partially owned entities are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured
based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated
fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding
periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared.  In
the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized non-cash
impairment losses on investments in partially owned entities, aggregating $85,459,000,

$281,098,000 and $44,936,000, respectively.  Included
in these amounts are $75,196,000, $240,757,000 and $40,000,000 of impairment
losses related to our investment in Toys in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Mortgage and Mezzanine Loans Receivable:

We invest in mortgage and mezzanine loans of entities that have significant
real estate assets.  These investments are either secured by the real property
or by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying
real estate.  We record these investments at the stated principal amount net of
any unamortized discount or premium. We accrete or amortize any discount or
premium over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective
interest method or straight-line method, if the result is not materially
different.  We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of
each of our loans whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such
amounts may not be recoverable. A loan is impaired when it is probable that we
will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual
terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by
comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or
as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is
collateral dependent.  Interest on impaired loans is recognized when received
in cash.  Mortgage and mezzanine loans receivable are included in “other
assets” on our consolidated balance sheets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less and are carried at cost, which approximates
fair value due to their short-term maturities.  The majority of our cash and
cash equivalents consists of (i) deposits at major commercial banks, which may
at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit, (ii) United
States Treasury Bills, and (iii) Certificate of Deposits placed through an
Account Registry Service (“CDARS”).  To date, we have not experienced any
losses on our invested cash.

Restricted Cash:

Restricted cash consists of security deposits, cash restricted for the purposes
of facilitating a Section 1031 Like-Kind exchange, cash restricted in
connection with our deferred compensation plan and cash escrowed under loan
agreements for debt service, real estate taxes, property insurance and capital

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts:

We periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from
tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the
lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from
the straight-lining of rents. This receivable arises from earnings recognized
in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management
exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment
history and current credit status in developing these estimates.  As of
December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had $17,060,000 and $21,869,000, respectively,
in allowances for doubtful accounts.  In addition, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013,
we had $3,188,000 and $4,355,000, respectively, in allowances for receivables
arising from the straight-lining of rents.

Deferred Charges:

Direct
financing costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related
agreements as a component of interest expense. Direct costs related to
successful leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a straight line
basis over the lives of the related leases. All other deferred charges are
amortized on a straight line basis, which approximates the effective interest
rate method, in accordance with the terms of the agreements to which they
relate.

Revenue Recognition:

We have the following revenue sources and
revenue recognition policies:

•      Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases. These
rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a
straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent
abatements under the leases.  We commence rental revenue recognition when the
tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is
substantially ready for its intended use.  In addition, in circumstances where
we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by
the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

•      Percentage Rent — income arising from retail tenant
leases that is contingent upon tenant sales exceeding defined thresholds. These
rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., when
tenant sales thresholds have been achieved).

•      Hotel Revenue — income arising from the operation of
the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage
revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied.
Food and beverage and banquet revenue is recognized when the services have been
rendered.

•      Trade Shows Revenue — income arising from the
operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is
recognized when the trade shows have occurred.

•      Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant
leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating
expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is
accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.

•      Management, Leasing and Other Fees — income arising
from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned
entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed
under the respective agreements.

•      Cleveland Medical Mart — revenue arising from the
development of the Cleveland Medical Mart.  This revenue was recognized as the
related services were performed under the respective agreements using the
criteria set forth in ASC 605-25,

Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities:

ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, as amended,
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, our derivative
instruments consisted of an interest rate cap and an interest rate swap.  We
record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for
changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the
derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the
exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm
commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are
considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted
transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

For derivatives designated as fair value hedges,
changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the
hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is
initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (outside of earnings)
and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects
earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the
derivative is recognized directly in earnings. We assess the effectiveness of
each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows
of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash
flows of the designated hedged item or transaction. For derivatives not
designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.

Income Taxes:

We operate in a manner
intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856‑860
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT
which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its
shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be
taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its
shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income and
therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.  Dividends
distributed for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, were characterized,
for federal income tax purposes, as ordinary income.  Dividend distributions
for the year ended December 31, 2012, were characterized, for Federal income
tax purposes, as 62.7% ordinary income and 37.3% long-term capital gain.

We have elected to treat certain consolidated subsidiaries, and may in
the future elect to treat newly formed subsidiaries, as taxable REIT
subsidiaries pursuant to an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code that became
effective January 1, 2001.  Taxable REIT subsidiaries may participate in
non-real estate related activities and/or perform non-customary services for
tenants and are subject to Federal and State income tax at regular corporate
tax rates. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries had a combined current income tax
expense of approximately $10,777,000, $9,608,000 and $20,336,000 for the years
ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and have immaterial
differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and
liabilities.

At
December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had deferred tax assets from our taxable REIT
subsidiaries of $94,100,000 and $87,800,000, respectively, against which we
have recorded a full valuation allowance because we have not determined that it
is more likely than not that we will realize these net operating loss
carryforwards which expire in 2034.  The year over year change in the valuation
allowance relates to an increase in the net operating loss carryforwards.

The following table reconciles net income attributable to common
shareholders to estimated taxable income for the years ended December 31, 2014,

3.     Vornado Capital Partners Real Estate Fund (the
“Fund”)

We are the
general partner and investment manager of the Fund, which has an eight-year
term and a three-year investment period

that ended in July 2013. During the
investment period, the Fund was our exclusive investment vehicle for all
investments that fit within its investment parameters, as defined.

The Fund is accounted for under the AICPA Investment
Company Guide and its investments are reported on its balance sheet at fair
value, with changes in value each period recognized in earnings. We consolidate
the accounts of the Fund into our consolidated financial statements, retaining
the fair value basis of accounting.

On June 26,
2014, the Fund sold its 64.7% interest in One Park Avenue to a newly formed
joint venture that we and an institutional investor own 55% and 45%,
respectively (see Note 6 -

Investments in Partially Owned Entities - One
Park Avenue)

.  This transaction was based on a property value of $560,000,000. 
From the inception of this investment through its disposition, the Fund
realized a $75,529,000 net gain.

On August 21, 2014, the Fund and its 50% joint
venture partner completed the sale of The Shops at Georgetown Park, a 305,000
square foot retail property, for $272,500,000. From the inception of this
investment through its disposition, the Fund realized a $51,124,000 net gain.

On January
20, 2015, we co-invested with the Fund and one of the Fund’s limited partners to
buy out the Fund’s joint venture partner’s 57% interest in the Crowne Plaza
Times Square Hotel.  The purchase price for the 57% interest was
approximately $95,000,000 (our share $39,000,000) which valued the property at
approximately $480,000,000.  The property is encumbered by a newly placed
$310,000,000 mortgage loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.80% and maturing in
December 2018 with a one-year extension option.   Our aggregate ownership
interest in the property increased to 33% from 11%.

At
December 31, 2014, the Fund

had seven investments
with an aggregate fair value of $513,973,000, or $176,899,000 in excess of
cost, and had remaining unfunded commitments of $144,123,000, of which our
share was $36,031,000.  At December 31, 2013, the Fund had nine investments
with an aggregate fair value of $667,710,000.

4.    
Acquisitions

On August 1, 2014, we acquired the land under
our 715 Lexington Avenue retail property located on the Southeast corner of 58

th

Street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, for $63,000,000.

On October 28, 2014

,
we completed the purchase of the retail condominium of the St. Regis Hotel for
$700,000,000.  We own a 74.3% controlling interest of the joint venture which
owns the property.  The acquisition was used in a like-kind exchange for income
tax purposes for the sale of 1740 Broadway (see Note 8 –

Dispositions

). 
We consolidate the accounts of the venture into our consolidated financial
statements from the date of acquisition.

On November 21, 2014, we
entered into an agreement to acquire the Center Building, an eight story
437,000 square foot office building, located at 33-00 Northern Boulevard in
Long Island City, New York.  The building is 98% leased.  The purchase price is
approximately $142,000,000, including the assumption of an existing $62,000,000
4.43% mortgage maturing in October 2018.  The purchase is expected to close in
the first quarter of 2015, subject to customary closing conditions.  As of
December 31, 2014, our $14,200,000 non-refundable deposit was included in
“other assets” on our consolidated balance sheet.

On January 20, 2015, we
co-invested with our 25% owned Fund and one of the Fund’s limited partners to
acquire the Fund’s joint venture partner’s 57% interest in the Crowne Plaza
Times Square Hotel (see Note 3 –

Available-for-sale securities are presented on our consolidated balance sheets
at fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses resulting from the mark-to-market
of these securities are included in “other comprehensive income (loss).” 
Realized gains and losses are recognized in earnings only upon the sale of the
securities and are recorded based on the weighted average cost of such
securities.

We evaluate our portfolio of marketable
securities for impairment each reporting period.  For each of the securities in
our portfolio with unrealized losses, we review the underlying cause of the
decline in value and the estimated recovery period, as well as the severity and
duration of the decline.  In our evaluation, we consider our ability and intent
to hold these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for us to
recover our cost basis.  We also evaluate the near-term prospects for each of these
investments in relation to the severity and duration of the decline.

Investment in Lexington Realty Trust (“Lexington”)
(NYSE: LXP)

From the inception of our investment in Lexington in
2008, until the first quarter of 2013, we accounted for our investment under
the equity method because of our ability to exercise significant influence over
Lexington’s operating and financial policies. As a result of Lexington’s common
share issuances, our ownership interest was reduced over time from
approximately 17.2% to 8.8% at March 31, 2013. In the first quarter of 2013, we
concluded that we no longer have the ability to exercise significant influence
over Lexington’s operating and financial policies, and began accounting for
this investment as a marketable equity security – available for sale, in
accordance with ASC Topic 320,

Investments – Debt and Equity Securities

.

Investment in J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (“J.C. Penney”)
(NYSE: JCP)

In the first
quarter of 2013, we wrote down 8,584,010 J.C. Penney common shares we owned to
fair value, based on J.C. Penney’s March 31, 2013 closing share price of $15.11
per share, and recorded a $39,487,000 impairment loss.  On September 19, 2013,
we settled a forward contract and received 4,815,990 J.C. Penney common
shares.  In connection therewith, we recognized a $33,487,000 loss from the
mark-to-market of the derivative position through its settlement date.  These
losses are included in “interest and other investment income (loss), net” on
our consolidated statements of income.

In March 2013
and September 2013, we sold an aggregate of 23,400,000 J.C. Penney common
shares at a price of $14.29 per share, or $334,500,000, resulting in a net loss
of $54,914,000.  The net losses resulting from these sales are included in “net
gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets” on our
consolidated statements of income.

Other Investments

During 2013 and 2012, we sold other marketable
securities for aggregate proceeds of $44,209,000 and $58,718,000, respectively,
resulting in net gains of $31,741,000 and $3,582,000, respectively, which are
included as a component of “net gain on disposition of wholly owned and
partially owned assets” on our consolidated statements of income.

Toys “R” Us (“Toys”)

As of December 31, 2014, we own 32.6% of Toys. 
We account for our investment in Toys under the equity method and record our
share of Toys’ net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because Toys’
fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, and our fiscal year ends
on December 31.  The business of Toys is highly seasonal and substantially all
of Toys’ net income is generated in its fourth quarter.

We have not
guaranteed any of Toys’ obligations and are not committed to provide any
support to Toys.  Pursuant to ASC 323-10-35-20, we discontinued applying
the equity method for our Toys’ investment when the carrying amount was reduced
to zero in the third quarter of 2014.  We will resume application of the equity
method if during the period the equity method was suspended our share of
unrecognized net income exceeds our share of unrecognized net losses.

In the first quarter of 2013, we recognized our
share of Toys’ fourth quarter net income of $78,542,000 and a corresponding
non-cash impairment loss of the same amount to continue to carry our investment
at fair value.

At December 31, 2013, we estimated that the fair
value of our investment in Toys was approximately $80,062,000 ($83,224,000
including $3,162,000 for our share of Toys’ accumulated other comprehensive
income), or $162,215,000 less than the carrying amount after recognizing our
share of Toys’ third quarter net loss in our fourth quarter.  In determining
the fair value of our investment, we considered, among other inputs, a December
31, 2013 third-party valuation of Toys.  As of December 31, 2013, we have
concluded that the decline in the value of our investment was
“other-than-temporary” based on, among other factors, Toys’ 2013 holiday sales
results, compression of earnings multiples of comparable retailers and our
inability to forecast a recovery in the near term.  Accordingly, we recognized
an additional non-cash impairment loss of $162,215,000 in the fourth quarter of
2013.

In the first
quarter of 2014, we recognized our share of Toys’ fourth quarter net income of
$75,196,000 and a corresponding non-cash impairment loss of the same amount to
continue to carry our investment at fair value.

Alexander’s, Inc.
(“Alexander’s”) (NYSE: ALX) - continued

As of December 31, 2014 the market value (“fair
value” pursuant to ASC 820) of our investment in Alexander’s, based on Alexander’s
December 31, 2014 closing share price of $437.18, was $723,125,000, or
$591,509,000 in excess of the carrying amount on our consolidated balance
sheet.  As of December 31, 2014, the carrying amount of our investment in
Alexander’s, excluding amounts owed to us, exceeds our share of the equity in
the net assets of Alexander’s by approximately $42,048,000.  The majority of
this basis difference resulted from the excess of our purchase price for the
Alexander’s common stock acquired over the book value of Alexander’s net
assets.  Substantially all of this basis difference was allocated, based on our
estimates of the fair values of Alexander’s assets and liabilities, to real
estate (land and buildings).  We are amortizing the basis difference related to
the buildings into earnings as additional depreciation expense over their
estimated useful lives.  This depreciation is not material to our share of
equity in Alexander’s net income.  The basis difference related to the land
will be recognized upon disposition of our investment.

Management, Leasing and Development Agreements

We receive an annual fee for managing Alexander’s
and all of its properties equal to the sum of (i) $2,800,000, (ii) 2% of
the gross revenue from the Rego Park II Shopping Center, (iii) $0.50 per square
foot of the tenant-occupied office and retail space at 731 Lexington Avenue,
and (iv) $280,000, escalating at 3% per annum, for managing the common area of
731 Lexington Avenue.  In addition, we are entitled to a development fee of 6%
of development costs, as defined.

We provide Alexander’s with leasing services for
a fee of 3% of rent for the first ten years of a lease term, 2% of rent for the
eleventh through twentieth year of a lease term and 1% of rent for the
twenty-first through thirtieth year of a lease term, subject to the payment of
rents by Alexander’s tenants.  In the event third-party real estate brokers are
used, our fee increases by 1% and we are responsible for the fees to the
third-parties.  We are also entitled to a commission upon the sale of any of
Alexander’s assets equal to 3% of gross proceeds, as defined, for asset sales
less than $50,000,000, and 1% of gross proceeds, as defined, for asset sales of
$50,000,000 or more.  The total of these amounts was payable to us in annual
installments in an amount not to exceed $4,000,000 with interest on the unpaid
balance at one-year LIBOR plus 1.0% (1.58% at December 31, 2014).

On December 22, 2014, the leasing agreements with
Alexander’s were amended to eliminate the annual installment cap of $4,000,000. 
In addition, Alexander’s repaid to us the outstanding balance of $40,353,000.

On January 15, 2015, we completed the spin-off of 79
strip shopping centers, three malls, a warehouse park and $225,000,000 of cash
to UE and the transfer of all of the employees responsible for the management
and leasing of those assets.   In addition, we entered into agreements with UE
to provide management and leasing services, on our behalf, for Alexander’s Rego
Park retail assets.   Fees for these services are similar to the fees we are
receiving from Alexander’s described above.

Other Agreements

Building Maintenance Services (“BMS”), our
wholly-owned subsidiary, supervises (i) cleaning, engineering and security
services at Alexander’s 731 Lexington Avenue property and (ii) security
services at Alexander’s Rego Park I and Rego Park II properties, for an annual
fee of the costs for such services plus 6%.  During the years ended December

acquisition of assets in excess of specified amounts, or the issuance of equity
interests.  Notwithstanding the terms of the definitive agreement, in
accordance with GAAP, we recorded our pro rata share of LNR’s earnings on a
one-quarter lag basis through the date of sale, which increased the carrying
amount of our investment in LNR above our share of the net sales proceeds and
resulted in us recognizing a $27,231,000 “other-than-temporary” impairment loss
on our investment in the three months ended March 31, 2013.

One Park
Avenue

On June 26,
2014, we invested an additional $22,700,000 to increase our ownership in One
Park Avenue to 55.0% from 46.5% through a joint venture with an institutional
investor, who increased its ownership interest to 45.0% (see Note 3 –

Vornado
Capital Partners Real Estate Fund)

.  The transaction was based on a
property value of $560,000,000.  The property is encumbered by a $250,000,000
interest-only mortgage loan that bears interest at 4.995% and matures in March
2016.  We account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity
method because we share control over major decisions with our joint venture
partner.

61 Ninth
Avenue

On July 23, 2014,
a joint venture in which we are a 50.1% partner entered into a 99-year ground
lease for 61 Ninth Avenue located on the Southwest corner of Ninth Avenue and

th

Street in Manhattan.  The venture’s current plans are to
construct an office building, with retail at the base, of approximately 130,000
square feet.  Total development costs are currently estimated to be approximately
$125,000,000.  We account for our investment in the joint venture under the
equity method because we share control over major decisions with our joint
venture partner.

The
following is a summary of condensed combined financial information for all of
our partially owned entities, including Toys, Alexander’s and LNR (sold in

7.   
Mortgage and Mezzanine Loans Receivable

In October 2012, we acquired a 25%
participation in a $475,000,000 first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the acquisition
and redevelopment of a 10-story retail building at 701 Seventh Avenue in Times
Square.  The loan had an interest rate of LIBOR plus 10.2%, with a LIBOR
floor of 1.0%.  Of the $475,000,000, we funded $93,750,000, representing
our 25% share of the $375,000,000 that was funded at acquisition.  In March
2013, we transferred at par, the 25% participation in the mortgage loan.  The
transfer did not qualify for sale accounting given our continuing interest in
the mezzanine loan.  Accordingly, we continued to include the 25% participation
in the mortgage loan in “other assets” and recorded a $59,375,000 liability in
“other liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013. 
On January 14, 2014, the mortgage and mezzanine loans were repaid; accordingly,
the $59,375,000 asset and liability were eliminated.

On April 17, 2013, a $50,091,000
mezzanine loan that was scheduled to mature in August 2015, was repaid. In
connection therewith, we received net proceeds of $55,358,000, including
prepayment penalties, which resulted in income of $5,267,000, which is included
in “interest and other investment income (loss), net” on our consolidated
statement of income.

In March 2014, a $30,000,000 mezzanine
loan that was scheduled to mature in January 2015 was repaid. In May 2014, a
$25,000,000 mezzanine loan that was scheduled to mature in November 2014 was
repaid.

As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the
carrying amounts of mortgage and mezzanine loans receivable were $16,748,000 and
$170,972,000, respectively, net of an allowance of $5,811,000 and $5,845,000,
respectively, and are included in “other assets” on our consolidated balance
sheets.  These loans have a weighted average interest rate of 9.1% and 11.0% at
December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively and have maturities ranging from April
2015 to May 2016.

10.    Debt

Secured Debt

On January 31, 2014, we completed a $600,000,000
loan secured by our 220 Central Park South development site.  The loan bears
interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% (2.92% at December 31, 2014) and matures in
January 2016, with three one-year extension options.

On April 16,

2014, we completed a
$350,000,000 refinancing of 909 Third Avenue, a 1.3 million square foot
Manhattan office building.  The seven-year interest only loan bears interest at
3.91% and matures in May 2021. We realized net proceeds of approximately $145,000,000
after defeasing the existing 5.64%, $193,000,000 mortgage, defeasance cost and
other closing costs.

On July 16, 2014, we completed a $130,000,000
financing of Las Catalinas, a 494,000 square foot mall located in the San Juan
area of Puerto Rico. The 10-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 4.43% and
matures in August 2024.  The loan amortizes based on a 30-year schedule
beginning in year six.

On August 12, 2014, we completed a $185,000,000
financing of the Universal buildings, a 690,000 square foot, two-building

1.90% (2.06% at December 31, 2014) and matures in August 2019 with two one-year

one-year extension options.

On December 8, 2014, we completed a $575,000,000

building.  The loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.65% (1.81% at December 31,
2014) and matures in 2019 with two one-year extension options.  We realized net
proceeds of approximately $143,000,000.  Pursuant to an existing swap
agreement, the $422,000,000 previous loan on the property was swapped to a
fixed rate of 4.78% through March 2018.  Therefore, $422,000,000 of the new
loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.78% through March 2018 and the balance
of $153,000,000 floats through March 2018.  The entire $575,000,000 will float
thereafter for the duration of the new loan.

On January 6, 2015, we completed the
modification of the $120,000,000, 6.04% mortgage loan secured by our
Montehiedra Town Center, in the San Juan area of Puerto Rico.  The loan has
been extended from July 2016 to July 2021 and separated into two tranches, a
senior $90,000,000 position with interest at 5.33% to be paid currently, and a
junior $30,000,000 position with interest accruing at 3%. Montehiedra Town
Center and the loan were included in the spin-off to UE on January 15, 2015. 
As part of the planned redevelopment of the property, UE is committed to fund
$20,000,000 through a loan for leasing and building capital expenditures of
which $8,000,000 has been funded.  This loan is senior to the $30,000,000
position noted above and accrues interest at 10%.

Senior Unsecured Notes

On June 16, 2014, we completed a green bond
public offering of $450,000,000 2.50% senior unsecured notes due June 30, 2019.
The notes were sold at 99.619% of their face amount to yield 2.581%.

On October 1, 2014, we
redeemed all of the $445,000,000 principal amount of our outstanding 7.875%
senior unsecured notes, which were scheduled to mature on October 1, 2039, at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest through
the redemption date.  In the fourth quarter of 2014, we wrote off $12,532,000
of unamortized deferred financing costs, which are included as a component of
“interest and debt expense” on our consolidated statements of income.

On January 1, 2015, we
redeemed all of the $500,000,000 principal amount of our outstanding 4.25%
senior unsecured notes, which were scheduled to mature on April 1, 2015, at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest through
December 31, 2014.

11.    Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Redeemable noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheets are primarily comprised of Class A Operating Partnership units held by third parties and  are recorded at the greater of their carrying amount or redemption value at the end of each reporting period.  Changes in the value from period to period are charged to “additional capital” in our consolidated statements of changes in equity.  Class A units may be tendered for redemption to the Operating Partnership for cash; we, at our option, may assume that obligation and pay the holder either cash or Vornado common shares on a one-for-one basis.  Because the number of Vornado common shares outstanding at all times equals the number of Class A units owned by Vornado, the redemption value of each Class A unit is equivalent to the market value of one Vornado common share, and the quarterly distribution to a Class A unitholder is equal to the quarterly dividend paid to a Vornado common shareholder.

14.  Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurement and
Disclosures

defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring
fair value.  The objective of fair value is to determine the price that would
be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the
exit price).

ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes
observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three
levels: Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are
accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities; Level 2 –
observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but
corroborated by market data; and Level 3 – unobservable inputs that are used
when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the
highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.
In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the
use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the
extent possible, as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment
of fair value.  Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret Level 2 and 3
inputs in determining the fair value of our financial and non-financial assets
and liabilities.  Accordingly, our fair value estimates, which are made at the
end of each reporting period, may be different than the amounts that may
ultimately be realized upon sale or disposition of these assets.

Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at
Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Financial assets and liabilities that are
measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets consist of (i)
marketable securities, (ii) Real Estate Fund investments, (iii) the assets in
our deferred compensation plan (for which there is a corresponding liability on
our consolidated balance sheet), (iv) interest rate swaps and (v) mandatorily
redeemable instruments (Series G-1 through G-4 convertible preferred units and
Series D-13 cumulative redeemable preferred units).  The tables below aggregate
the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities by their levels in
the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Real Estate Fund
Investments

At December 31,
2014, our Real Estate Fund had seven investments with an aggregate fair value
of $513,973,000, or $176,899,000 in excess of cost.  These investments are
classified as Level 3.  We use a discounted cash flow valuation technique to
estimate the fair value of each of these investments, which is updated
quarterly by personnel responsible for the management of each investment and
reviewed by senior management at each reporting period.  The discounted cash
flow valuation technique requires us to estimate cash flows for each investment
over the anticipated holding period, which currently ranges from 0.8 to 6.0 years. 
Cash flows are derived from property rental revenue (base rents plus
reimbursements) less operating expenses, real estate taxes and capital and
other costs, plus projected sales proceeds in the year of exit.  Property
rental revenue is based on leases currently in place and our estimates for
future leasing activity, which are based on current market rents for similar
space plus a projected growth factor.  Similarly, estimated operating expenses
and real estate taxes are based on amounts incurred in the current period plus
a projected growth factor for future periods.  Anticipated sales proceeds at
the end of an investment’s expected holding period are determined based on the
net cash flow of the investment in the year of exit, divided by a terminal capitalization
rate, less estimated selling costs.

The fair value
of each property is calculated by discounting the future cash flows (including
the projected sales proceeds), using an appropriate discount rate and then
reduced by the property’s outstanding debt, if any, to determine the fair value
of the equity in each investment. Significant unobservable quantitative inputs
used in determining the fair value of each investment include capitalization
rates and discount rates.  These rates are based on the location, type and
nature of each property, and current and anticipated market conditions, which
are derived from original underwriting assumptions, industry publications and
from the experience of our Acquisitions and Capital Markets departments.  Significant
unobservable quantitative inputs in the table below were utilized in
determining the fair value of these Fund investments at December 31, 2014.

Discount rates

12.0% to 17.5%

The
above inputs are subject to change based on changes in economic and market
conditions and/or changes in use or timing of exit.  Changes in discount rates
and terminal capitalization rates result in increases or decreases in the fair
values of these investments.  The discount rates encompass, among other things,
uncertainties in the valuation models with respect to terminal capitalization
rates and the amount and timing of cash flows.  Therefore, a change in the fair
value of these investments resulting from a change in the terminal
capitalization rate, may be partially offset by a change in the discount rate. 
It is not possible for us to predict the effect of future economic or market
conditions on our estimated fair values.

Deferred
Compensation Plan Assets

Deferred compensation
plan assets that are classified as Level 3 consist of investments in limited
partnerships and investment funds, which are managed by third parties.  We
receive quarterly financial reports from a third-party administrator, which are
compiled from the quarterly reports provided to them from each limited partnership
and investment fund.  The quarterly reports provide net asset values on a fair
value basis which are audited by independent public accounting firms on an
annual basis.  The third-party administrator does not adjust these values in
determining our share of the net assets and we do not adjust these values when
reported in our consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Measurements on a Nonrecurring
Basis

Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis on our consolidated balance sheets consist primarily of real estate
assets and our investment in Toys that were written-down to estimated fair
value during 2014 or 2013.  See Note 2 –

Basis of Presentation and
Significant Accounting Policies

for details of impairment losses recognized
during 2014 and 2013.  See Note 6

– Investments in Partially Owned Entities

for details of impairment losses related to Toys recognized during 2014 and
2013.  The fair value of our real estate assets was determined using widely
accepted valuation techniques, including (i) discounted cash flow analysis,
which considers, among other things, leasing assumptions, growth rates,
discount rates and terminal capitalization rates, (ii) income capitalization
approach, which considers prevailing market capitalization rates, and (iii)
comparable sales activity.  In determining the fair value of our investment in
Toys, we considered, among other inputs, a December 31, 2013 third-party valuation
of Toys and Toys’ historical results, financial forecasts and business
outlook.  Our determination of the fair value of our investment in Toys
included consideration of the following widely-used valuation methodologies:
(i) market multiple methodology, that considered comparable publicly traded
retail companies and a range of EBITDA multiples from 5.75x to 6.5x, (ii)
comparable sales transactions methodology, that considered sales of retailers
ranging in size from $150 million to $3 billion, (iii) a discounted cash flow
methodology, that utilized five-year financial projections and assumed a
terminal EBITDA multiple of 5.75x, a 10% discount rate and a 38% tax rate, and
(iv) a Black-Scholes valuation analysis, that assumed one, two and three year
time-to-expiration periods and 24% to 29% volatility factors.  Generally, we
consider multiple valuation techniques when measuring fair values but in
certain circumstances, a single valuation technique may be appropriate.  The
tables below aggregate the fair values of these assets by their levels in the

Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured
at Fair Value

Financial assets and liabilities that are not
measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets include cash equivalents
(primarily money market funds, which invest in obligations of the United States
government), mortgage and mezzanine loans receivable (included in “other assets”
in our consolidated balance sheets) and our secured and unsecured debt. 
Estimates of the fair value of these instruments are determined by the standard
practice of modeling the contractual cash flows required under the instrument
and discounting them back to their present value at the appropriate current
risk adjusted interest rate, which is provided by a third-party specialist. 
For floating rate debt, we use forward rates derived from observable market
yield curves to project the expected cash flows we would be required to make
under the instrument.  The fair value of cash equivalents is classified as
Level 1 and the fair value of our mortgage and mezzanine loans receivable is
classified as Level 3.  The fair value of our secured and unsecured debt is
classified as Level 2.  The table below summarizes the carrying amounts and

15.    Stock-based Compensation

Our Omnibus Share
Plan (the “Plan”), which was approved in May 2010, provides the Compensation
Committee of the Board (the “Committee”) the ability to grant incentive and
non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted Operating Partnership
units and out-performance plan awards to certain of our employees and
officers.  Under the Plan, awards may be granted up to a maximum of 6,000,000
shares, if all awards granted are Full Value Awards, as defined, and up to
12,000,000 shares, if all of the awards granted are Not Full Value Awards, as defined,
plus shares in respect of awards forfeited after May 2010 that were issued
pursuant to our 2002 Omnibus Share Plan.  Full Value Awards are awards of
securities, such as restricted shares, that, if all vesting requirements are
met, do not require the payment of an exercise price or strike price to acquire
the securities.  Not Full Value Awards are awards of securities, such as
options, that do require the payment of an exercise price or strike price. 
This means, for example, if the Committee were to award only restricted shares,
it could award up to 6,000,000 restricted shares.  On the other hand, if the
Committee were to award only stock options, it could award options to purchase
up to 12,000,000 shares (at the applicable exercise price).  The Committee may
also issue any combination of awards under the Plan, with reductions in
availability of future awards made in accordance with the above limitations. 
As of December 31, 2014, we have approximately 4,004,000 shares available for
future grants under the Plan, if all awards granted are Full Value Awards, as
defined.

In the years ended
December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized an aggregate of $36,641,000, $34,914,000
and $30,588,000, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense, which is included
as a component of “general and administrative” expenses on our consolidated
statements of income.  The details of the various components of our stock-based
compensation are discussed below.

Out-Performance Plans (“the
OPPs”)

OPPs are multi-year, performance-based equity
compensation plans under which participants, including our Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, have the opportunity to earn compensation payable in the
form of equity awards if, and only if, we outperform a predetermined total
shareholder return (“TSR”) and/or outperform the market with respect to a
relative TSR in any year during the requisite performance periods as described
below.   The aggregate notional amounts of the 2012, 2013, 2014 and
2015 OPPs are $40,000,000, $40,000,000, $50,000,000 and $40,000,000,
respectively.

Awards under the 2012 OPP have been earned. 
Awards under the 2013 OPP may be earned if we (i) achieve a TSR greater than
14% over the two-year performance measurement period, or 21% over the three-year
performance measurement period (the “Absolute Component”), and/or (ii) achieve
a TSR above that of the SNL REIT Index (the “Index”) over the two-year or
three-year performance measurement period (the “Relative Component”).  Awards
under the 2014 and 2015 OPP may be earned if we (i) achieve a TSR level greater
than 7% per annum, or 21% over the three-year performance measurement periods
(the “Absolute Component”), and/or (ii) achieve a TSR above that of the Index
over the three-year performance measurement periods (the “Relative
Component”).  To the extent awards would be earned under the Absolute Component
of each of the OPPs, but we underperform the Index, such awards would be
reduced (and potentially fully negated) based on the degree to which we underperform
the Index.  In certain circumstances, in the event we outperform the Index
but awards would not otherwise be fully earned under the Absolute Component,
awards may still be earned or increased under the Relative Component.  To
the extent awards would otherwise be earned under the Relative Component but we
fail to achieve at least a 6% per annum absolute TSR, such awards earned under
the Relative Component would be reduced based on our absolute TSR, with no
awards being earned in the event our TSR during the applicable measurement
period is 0% or negative, irrespective of the degree to which we may outperform
the Index.  Dividends on awards issued accrue during the performance
period.

If the designated performance objectives are
achieved, OPP units are subject to time-based vesting requirements. Awards
earned under the OPPs vest 33% in year three, 33% in year four and 34% in year
five.  Our executive officers (for the purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange
Act) are required to hold earned 2013, 2014 and 2015 OPP awards for one year
following vesting.

The fair value of the 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 OPPs
on the date of grant was $12,250,000, $6,814,000, $8,202,000, and $9,120,000, respectively. 
Such amounts are being amortized into expense over a five-year period from the
date of grant, using a graded vesting attribution model.  In the years ended
December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $6,185,000, $3,226,000 and $2,826,000,
respectively, of compensation expense related to OPPs.  As of December 31, 2014,
there was $11,937,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the
OPPs, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted at an exercise price
equal to the average of the high and low market price of our common shares on
the NYSE on the date of grant, generally vest over four years and expire 10
years from the date of grant.  Compensation expense related to stock option
awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  In the
years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $4,550,000, $8,234,000
and $8,638,000, respectively, of compensation expense related to stock options
that vested during each year.  As of December 31, 2014, there was $1,855,000 of
total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which
is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.

20.  Leases

As lessor:

We lease space to tenants under operating leases.
Most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base rentals payable
monthly in advance. Office building leases generally require the tenants to
reimburse us for operating costs and real estate taxes above their base year
costs. Shopping center leases provide for pass-through to tenants the tenant’s
share of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance. Shopping center leases
also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rent based on a
percentage of the tenants’ sales. As of December 31, 2014, future base rental
revenue under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding rents for leases with
an original term of less than one year and rents resulting from the exercise of
renewal options, are as follows:

None of our tenants accounted for more
than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013
and 2012.

We
are also a lessee under a capital lease under which we will redevelop the
retail and signage components of the Marriott Marquis Times Square Hotel.  The
lease has put/call options, which if exercised would lead to our ownership. 
Capitalized leases are recorded at the present value of future minimum lease
payments or the fair market value of the property.  Capitalized leases are depreciated
on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset or life of the
related lease.  Depreciation expense on capital leases is included in

21.  Multiemployer
Benefit Plans

Our subsidiaries make contributions to
certain multiemployer defined benefit plans (“Multiemployer Pension Plans”) and
health plans (“Multiemployer Health Plans”) for our union represented
employees, pursuant to the respective collective bargaining agreements.

Multiemployer
Pension Plans

Multiemployer Pension Plans differ from
single-employer pension plans in that (i) contributions to multiemployer plans
may be used to provide benefits to employees of other     participating
employers and (ii) if other participating employers fail to make their
contributions, each of our participating subsidiaries may be required to bear
its then pro rata share of unfunded obligations.  If a participating subsidiary
withdraws from a plan in which it participates, it may be subject to a
withdrawal liability.  As of December 31, 2014, our subsidiaries’
participation in these plans were not significant to our consolidated financial
statements.

In the years ended December 31, 2014,
2013 and 2012, our subsidiaries contributed $11,431,000, $10,223,000 and
$10,683,000, respectively, towards Multiemployer Pension Plans, which is
included as a component of “operating” expenses on our consolidated statements
of income.  Our subsidiaries’ contributions did not represent more than 5% of
total employer contributions in any of these plans for the years ended December
31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

Multiemployer
Health Plans

Multiemployer Health Plans in which our
subsidiaries participate provide health benefits to eligible active and retired
employees.  In the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our
subsidiaries contributed $29,073,000, $26,262,000 and $26,759,000,
respectively, towards these plans, which is included as a component of
“operating” expenses on our consolidated statements of income.

22.  Commitments and Contingencies

Insurance

We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods.  Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $180,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, up to a $180,000,000 annual aggregate. We maintain coverage for terrorism acts with limits of $4.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate, and $2.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) terrorism events, as defined by Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, which expires in December 2020.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for NBCR acts.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC.  For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and 15% of the balance of a covered loss (16% effective January 1, 2016) and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of a covered loss (84% effective January 1, 2016).  We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us.  However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space.  These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans.  As of December 31, 2014, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $359,000,000.

At December 31, 2014, $39,552,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our revolving credit facilities.  Our revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

As of December 31, 2014, w

e expect to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating

approximately $104,000,000.

Alexander’s

We own 32.4% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board and Chief Executive Officer is also the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s.  We provide various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements.  These agreements are described in Note 6 -

Investments in Partially Owned Entities

.

On January 15, 2015, we completed the spin-off of 79 strip shopping centers, three malls, a warehouse park and $225,000,000 of cash to UE and the transfer of all of the employees responsible for the management and leasing of those assets.   In addition, we entered into agreements with UE to provide management and leasing services, on our behalf, for Alexander’s Rego Park retail assets.   Fees for these services are similar to the fees we are receiving from Alexander’s described in Note 6 -

Investments in Partially Owned Entities

.

Interstate Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr. Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s, are Interstate’s two other partners. As of December 31, 2014, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 6.6% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 26.3% of Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent.  The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term.  We believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies, that the management agreement terms are fair to us.  We earned $535,000, $606,000, and $794,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

On January 15, 2015, we completed the spin-off of 79 strip shopping centers, three malls, a warehouse park and $225,000,000 of cash to UE and the transfer of all of the employees responsible for the management and leasing of those assets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

25.    Segment Information – continued

Notes to preceding tabular information:

(1)

EBITDA represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization." We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)

Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax expense (benefit) in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these items from partially owned entities.

ITEM 9A.     Controls
and procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures:  Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a‑15 (e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period
covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the
end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: 
There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended) during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to which
this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Management of Vornado Realty Trust, together
with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”), is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the
supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As of December 31, 2014, management conducted
an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework established in

Internal Control –
Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management
has determined that our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2014 was effective.

Our internal control over financial reporting
includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and
dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and our trustees; and provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial
statements.

The effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their
report appearing on page 144, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2014.


REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board
of Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We have audited the
internal control over financial reporting of Vornado Realty Trust, together
with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2014,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework
(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the
company’s board of trustees, management, and other personnel to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of the inherent
limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that
the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited,
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 of the
Company and our report dated February 17, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion
on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.
