2005 ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS

Beverly Connection

On March 5, 2005, the Company acquired a 50% interest
in a venture that owns Beverly Connection, a two-level urban shopping center,
containing 322,000 square feet, located in Los Angeles, California for
$10,700,000 in cash. The Company also provided the venture with a $59,500,000
first mortgage loan which bore interest at 10% through its scheduled maturity
in February 2006 and $35,000,000 of preferred equity yielding 13.5% for up to a
three-year term, which is subordinate to $37,200,000 of other preferred equity and
debt. On February 11, 2006, $35,000,000 of the Company’s loan to the venture
was converted to additional preferred equity on the same terms as the Company’s
existing preferred equity. The balance of the loan of $24,500,000 was extended
to April 11, 2006 and bears interest at 10%. The shopping center is anchored by
CompUSA, Old Navy and Sports Chalet. The venture is redeveloping the existing
retail and plans, subject to governmental approvals, to develop residential
condominiums and assisted living facilities.

Westbury Retail Condominium

On May 20, 2005, the Company acquired the retail
condominium of the former Westbury Hotel in Manhattan, consisting of the entire
block front on Madison Avenue between 69

th

Street and 70

th

Street, for $113,000,000 in cash. Simultaneously with the closing, the Company
placed an $80,000,000 mortgage loan on the property bearing interest at 5.292%
and maturing in 2018. The remaining portion of the purchase price was funded as
part of a Section 1031 tax-free “like-kind” exchange with a portion of the
proceeds from the sale of the 400 North LaSalle Residential Tower in April
2005. The property contains approximately 17,000 square feet and is fully
occupied by luxury retailers, Cartier, Chloe and Gucci under leases that expire
in 2018.

Bowen Building

On June 13, 2005, the Company acquired the 90% that it
did not already own of the Bowen Building, a 231,000 square foot class A office
building located at 875 15

th

Street N.W. in the Central Business
District of Washington, D.C. The purchase price was $119,000,000, consisting of
$63,000,000 in cash and $56,000,000 of existing mortgage debt, which bears
interest at LIBOR plus 1.5%, (5.66% as of December 31, 2005) and is due in
February 2007.


H Street Building Corporation (“H Street”)

On July 20, 2005, the Company acquired H Street, which
owns directly or indirectly through stock ownership in corporations, a 50%
interest in real estate assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia, including 34
acres of land leased to various residential and retail operators, a 1,670 unit
apartment complex, 10 acres of land and two office buildings located in
Washington, D.C. containing 577,000 square feet. The purchase price was
approximately $246,600,000, consisting of $194,500,000 in cash and
$52,100,000 for the Company’s pro rata share of existing mortgage debt.

On July 22, 2005, two corporations 50% owned by H
Street filed a complaint against the Company, H Street and three parties
affiliated with the sellers of H Street in the Superior Court of the District
of Columbia alleging that the Company encouraged H Street and the affiliated
parties to breach their fiduciary duties to these corporations and interfered
with prospective business and contractual relationships. The complaint seeks an
unspecified amount of damages and a rescission of the Company’s acquisition of
H Street. In addition, on July 29, 2005, a tenant under a ground lease with one
of these corporations brought a separate suit in the Superior Court of the
District of Columbia, alleging, among other things, that the Company’s
acquisition of H Street violated a provision giving them a right of first offer
and on that basis seeks a rescission of the Company’s acquisition and the right
to acquire H Street for the price paid by the Company. On September 12, 2005,
the Company filed a complaint against each of these corporations and their
acting directors seeking a restoration of H Street’s full shareholder rights
and damages. These legal actions are currently in the discovery stage. The
Company believes that the actions filed against the Company are without merit
and that it will ultimately be successful in defending against them.

Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”)

On July 21, 2005,
a joint venture owned equally by the Company, Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co. acquired Toys for $26.75 per share in cash or approximately
$6.6 billion. In connection therewith, the Company invested $428,000,000 of the
$1.3 billion of equity in the venture, consisting of $407,000,000 in cash and
$21,000,000 in Toys common shares held by the Company.

On August 29,
2005, the Company acquired $150,000,000 of the $1.9 billion one-year senior
unsecured bridge loan financing provided to Toys. The loan is senior to the acquisition
equity of $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion of existing debt. The loan bears
interest at LIBOR plus 5.25% (9.43% as of December 31, 2005) not to exceed 11%
and provides for an initial .375% placement fee and additional fees of .375% at
the end of three and six months if the loan has not been repaid. The loan is
prepayable at any time without penalty. On December 9, 2005, $73,184,000 of
this loan was repaid to the Company.

On January 9,
2006, Toys announced plans and is in the process of closing 87 Toys “R” Us
stores in the United States, of which twelve stores will be converted into
Babies “R” Us stores, five leased properties are expiring and one has been
sold. Vornado is handling the leasing and disposition of the real estate of the
remaining 69 stores. As a result of the store-closing program, Toys will incur
restructuring and other charges aggregating approximately $155,000,000 before
tax, which includes $45,000,000 for the cost of liquidating inventory. Of this
amount, approximately $99,000,000 will be recorded in Toys’ fourth quarter
ending January 28, 2006 and $56,000,000 will be recorded in the first quarter
of their next fiscal year. These estimated amounts are preliminary and remain
subject to change. The Company’s 32.95% share of the $155,000,000 charge is
$51,000,000, of which $36,000,000 will have no income statement effect as a
result of purchase price accounting and the remaining portion relating to the
cost of liquidating the inventory of approximately $9,000,000 after-tax, will
be recorded as an expense in the first quarter of 2006.

40 East 66

th

Street

On July 25, 2005,
the Company acquired a property located at Madison Avenue and East 66

th

On August 26,
2005, a joint venture in which the Company has a 90% interest acquired a
property located at 220 Central Park South in Manhattan for $136,550,000. The
Company and its partner invested cash of $43,400,000 and $4,800,000,
respectively, in the venture to acquire the property. The venture obtained a
$95,000,000 mortgage loan that bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.50% (8.04% as of
December 31, 2005) and matures in August 2006, with two six-month extensions. The
property contains 122 rental apartments with an aggregate of 133,000 square
feet and 5,700 square feet of commercial space.


Investment in Sears, Roebuck and Co. (“Sears”)

In July and August 2004, the
Company acquired an aggregate of 1,176,600 common shares of Sears, Roebuck and
Co. (“Sears”) for $41,945,000, an average price of $35.65 per share.

On
March 30, 2005, upon consummation of the merger between Sears and Kmart, the
Company received 370,330 common shares of Sears Holdings Corporation (Nasdaq: SHLD)
(“Sears Holdings”) and $21,797,000 of cash in exchange for its 1,176,600 Sears
common shares. The Sears Holdings common shares were valued at $48,143,000,
based on the March 30, 2005 closing share price of $130.00. As a result the
Company recognized a net gain of $27,651,000, the difference between the
aggregate cost basis in the Sears shares and the market value of the total
consideration received of $69,940,000. On April 4, 2005, 99,393 of the
Company’s Sears Holdings common shares with a value of $13,975,000 were
utilized to satisfy a third-party participation. The remaining 270,937 Sears
Holdings shares were sold in the fourth quarter of 2005 at a weighted average
sales price of $125.83 per share, which resulted in a net loss on disposition
of $1,137,000, based on the March 30, 2005 adjusted cost basis of $130.00 per
share. The Company’s net gain on its investment in these Sears shares was
$26,514,000.

In August and September 2004, the Company acquired an
economic interest in an additional 7,916,900 Sears common shares through a
series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution
pursuant to which the Company purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a
put option at the same strike price on Sears common shares. These call and put
options had an initial weighted-average strike price of $39.82 per share, or an
aggregate of $315,250,000, expire in April 2006 and provide for net cash
settlement. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options
increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and is credited for
the dividends received on the shares. The options provide the Company with the
same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the underlying common shares
and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45
basis points. Because these options are derivatives and do not qualify for
hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the
mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period are
recognized as an increase or decrease in “interest and other investment income”
on the Company’s consolidated statement of income.

On March 30, 2005, as a result of the merger between
Sears and Kmart and pursuant to the terms of the contract, the Company’s
derivative position representing 7,916,900 Sears common shares became a
derivative position representing 2,491,819 common shares of Sears Holdings
valued at $323,936,000 based on the then closing share price of $130.00 and
$146,663,000 of cash. As a result, the Company recognized a net gain of
$58,443,000 based on the fair value of the derivative position on March 30,
2005. During the fourth quarter of 2005, 402,660 of the common shares were sold
at a weighted average sales price of $123.77 per share. In accordance with the
derivative agreements, the proceeds from these sales will remain in the
derivative position until the entire position is settled or until expiration in
April 2006. Based on Sears Holdings’ closing share price on December 31, 2005
of $115.53, the remaining shares in the derivative position have a market value
of $241,361,000, which together with cash of $196,499,000 aggregates
$437,860,000. In the period from March 31, 2005 through December 31, 2005, the
Company recorded an expense of $43,475,000 from the derivative position, which
consists of (i) $30,230,000 from the mark-to-market of the remaining shares in
the derivative based on Sears Holdings $115.53 closing share price on December
31, 2005, (ii) $2,509,000 for the net loss on the shares sold based on a
weighted average sales price of $123.77 and (iii) $10,736,000 resulting
primarily from the increase in the strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus
45 basis points.

The Company’s aggregate net income recognized on the
owned shares and the derivative position from inception to December 31, 2005
was $124,266,000.

Investment
in Sears Canada Inc. (“Sears Canada”)

In connection with the Company’s investment in Sears
Holdings Corporation, the Company acquired 7,500,000 common shares of Sears
Canada between February and September of 2005 for an aggregate cost of
$143,737,000, or $19.16 per share. On December 16, 2005, Sears Canada paid a
special dividend, of which Vornado’s share was $120,500,000. As a result, the
Company recognized $22,885,000 of income in the fourth quarter of 2005 (in
addition to the unrecognized gain of $53,870,000 discussed below) and paid a
$.77 special cash dividend on December 30, 2005 to shareholders of record on
December 27, 2005. The Company accounts for its investment in Sears Canada as a
marketable equity security classified as available-for-sale. Accordingly, the
common shares are marked-to-market on a quarterly basis through “Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income” on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2005, based
on a closing share price of $15.47, the unrecognized gain in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income is $53,870,000.


Investment in

McDonald’s
Corporation (“McDonalds”) (NYSE: MCD)

In July 2005, the Company
acquired an aggregate of 858,000 common shares of McDonalds for $25,346,000, an
average price of $29.54 per share. These shares are recorded as marketable
equity securities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and are
classified as “available for sale.” Appreciation or depreciation in the fair
market value of these shares is recorded as an increase or decrease in
“accumulated other comprehensive income” in the shareholders’ equity section of
the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and not recognized in income. At
December 31, 2005, based on McDonalds’ closing stock price of $33.72 per share,
$3,585,000 of appreciation in the value of these shares was included in
“accumulated other comprehensive income.”

During the three months
ended September 30, 2005, the Company acquired an economic interest in an
additional 14,565,000 McDonalds common shares through a series of privately
negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which the
Company purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the
same strike price on McDonalds’ common shares. These call and put options have
an initial weighted-average strike price of $32.66 per share, or an aggregate
of $475,692,000, expire on various dates between July 30, 2007 and September
10, 2007 and provide for net cash settlement. Under these agreements, the
strike price for each pair of options increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus
45 basis points (up to 95 basis points under certain circumstances) and is
credited for the dividends received on the shares. The options provide the
Company with the same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the
underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual
rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options are derivatives and
do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting
from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period are
recognized as an increase or decrease in “interest and other investment income”
on the Company’s consolidated statement of income. During the year ended
December 31, 2005, the Company recorded net income of $17,254,000, comprised of
(i) $15,239,000 from the mark-to-market of the options on December 31, 2005,
based on McDonalds’ closing stock price of $33.72 per share, (ii) $9,759,000 of
dividend income, partially offset by (iii) $7,744,000 for the increase in
strike price resulting from the LIBOR charge.

Based on McDonalds’ most recent
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company’s aggregate
investment in McDonalds represents 1.2% of McDonalds’ outstanding common
shares.

to

purchase the
1.4 million square foot Springfield Mall which is located on 79 acres at
the intersection of Interstate 95 and Franconia Road in Springfield, Fairfax
County, Virginia, and is anchored by Macy’s, and J.C. Penney and Target, who
own their stores aggregating 389,000 square feet. The purchase price for the
option was $35,600,000, of which the Company paid $14,000,000 in cash at
closing and the remainder of $21,600,000 will be paid in installments over four
years. The Company intends to redevelop, reposition and re-tenant the mall and
has committed to spend $25,000,000 in capital expenditures over a six-year
period from the closing of the option agreement. The option becomes exercisable
upon the passing of one of the existing principals of the selling entity and
may be deferred at the Company’s election through November 2012. Upon exercise
of the option, the Company will pay $80,000,000 to acquire the mall, subject to
the existing mortgage of $180,000,000, which will be amortized to $149,000,000
at maturity in 2013. Upon closing of the option on January 31, 2006, the
Company acquired effective control of the mall, including management of the
mall and right to the mall’s net cash flow. Accordingly, the Company will
consolidate the accounts of the mall into its financial position and results of
operations pursuant to the provisions of FIN 46R. The Company has a 2.5%
minority partner in this transaction.

Other

In addition to the acquisitions and investments
described above, the Company made $281,500,000 of other acquisitions and
investments during 2005, which are summarized below:


2005 DISPOSITIONS

400 North LaSalle

On April 21, 2005, the Company, through its 85% owned
joint venture, sold 400 North LaSalle, a 452-unit high-rise residential tower
in Chicago, Illinois, for $126,000,000, which resulted in a net gain on sale of
$31,614,000. All of the proceeds from the sale were reinvested in tax-free
“like-kind” exchange investments pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal
Revenue Code.

3700 Las Vegas Boulevard

On December 30, 2005, the
Company sold its $3,050,000 senior preferred equity in 3700 Associates LLC,
which owns 3700 Las Vegas Boulevard, a development land parcel, and recognized
a net gain of $12,110,000. In addition, the purchaser repaid the Company’s
$5,000,000 senior mezzanine loan to the venture.

MEZZANINE LOAN ACTIVITY

On January 7, 2005, all of
the outstanding General Motors Building loans aggregating $275,000,000 were
repaid. In connection therewith, the Company received a $4,500,000 prepayment
premium and $1,996,000 of accrued interest and fees through January 14, 2005,
which is included in “interest and other income” on the Company’s consolidated
statement of income for the year ended

December 31, 2005.

On February 3, 2005, the Company made a $135,000,000
mezzanine loan to Riley Holdco Corp., an entity formed to complete the
acquisition of LNR Property Corporation (NYSE: LNR). The terms of the
financings are as follows: (i) $60,000,000 of a $325,000,000 mezzanine tranche
of a $2,400,000,000 credit facility secured by certain equity interests and
which is junior to $1,900,000,000 of the credit facility, bears interest at
LIBOR plus 5.25% (9.64% as of December 31, 2005) and matures in February 2008
with two one-year extensions; and (ii) $75,000,000 of $400,000,000 of unsecured
notes which are subordinate to the $2,400,000,000 credit facility and senior to
over $700,000,000 of equity contributed to finance the acquisition. These notes
mature in February 2015, provide for a 1.5% placement fee, and bear interest at
10% for the first five years and 11% for years six through ten.

On April 7, 2005, the
Company made

a $108,000,000 mezzanine loan secured by The Sheffield, a

apartments, 45,000 square feet of retail space and an underground parking
garage. The loan is subordinate to $630,000,000 of other debt, matures in
November 2007 with two one-year extensions and bears interest at LIBOR plus
6.25% (10.64% at December 31, 2005).


DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT
PROJECTS

The Company is currently engaged in various
development/redevelopment projects for which it has budgeted approximately
$718.5 million. Of this amount, $10.0 million was expended prior to 2005,
$117.5 million was expended in 2005 and $228.0 million is estimated to be
expended in 2006. Below is a description of these projects.

During 2004 and 2005, the PTO vacated approximately
1,864,000 square feet in the Company’s Crystal City office buildings and will
vacate an additional 75,000 square feet in the first quarter of 2006. The
Company plans to redevelop certain of these buildings, including Crystal Plaza
Two, Three and Four, which have been taken out of service. Crystal Plaza Two,
subject to governmental approvals, will be converted from a 13-story office
building, containing 181,000 square feet, to a 19-story, 256 unit, residential
tower containing 265,000 rentable/saleable square feet, at an estimated cost of
$85,000,000 to $92,000,000. Renovations to Crystal Plaza Three and Four include
new mechanical systems, restrooms, lobbies and corridors. The renovations to
Crystal Plaza Three and Four are expected to be completed by the end of 2006 at
an approximate cost of $65,900,000. Renovations to the remaining office
buildings not taken out of service include common area and exterior
renovations. See Item II — Properties for details of the lease up of the PTO
space.

In addition, to the projects noted above, on July 19,
2005 a joint venture, owned 50% by the Company, entered into a Memorandum of
Understanding and has been conditionally designated as the developer to convert
a portion of the Farley Post Office in Manhattan into the new Moynihan Train
Station. The plans for the Moynihan Station project involve 300,000 square feet
for a new transportation facility to be financed with public funding, as well
as 850,000 square feet of commercial space and up to 1,000,000 square feet of
air rights intended to be transferred to an adjacent site. The commercial space
is currently anticipated to include a variety of retail uses, restaurants, a
boutique hotel and merchandise mart space. The joint venture is also
considering alternate variations of this project, which may include a sports
arena, which would give rise to a much larger scale redevelopment opportunity.

The Company is also in the pre-development phase of
other real estate projects for which final plans and budgeted costs have yet to
be determined. Such projects include: (i) redeveloping certain shopping malls,
including the South Hills and Springfield Malls, (ii) redeveloping and
expanding retail space in the Penn Plaza area, (iii) converting an industrial
warehouse in Garfield, New Jersey to 500,000 square feet of retail space, (iv)
converting residential apartment buildings to condominiums, including 220
Central Park South and 40 East 66

th

Street, (v) redeveloping certain
assets in the SoHo area of Manhattan, and (vi) redeveloping and expanding the
Beverly Connection shopping center in Los Angeles, California to include
residential condominium units and assisted living facilities.

There can be no assurance that any of the above
projects will commence or be completed on schedule or on budget.


FINANCING ACTIVITIES

On August 10, 2005, the Company sold 9,000,000 common
shares at a price of $86.75 per share for gross proceeds of $780,750,000 in a
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement.

During
2005, the Company issued $382,500,000 of Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares
at a weighted average rate of 6.66% and $100,000,000 Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership at a weighted average rate of
6.75% and redeemed $115,000,000 and $697,000,000 of outstanding Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Shares and Units with a weighted average rate of 8.50% and
8.25%, respectively. The Company also completed property level financings of
$543,600,000 and issued $500,000,000 of 3.875% exchangeable senior debentures
due 2025.

On February 16, 2006, the Company completed a public
offering of $250,000,000 principal amount of 5.60% senior unsecured notes due
2011 pursuant to an effective registration statement. The net proceeds from
this offering, after underwriters’ discount, were $248,265,000.

The Company may seek to obtain additional capital
through equity offerings, debt financings or asset sales, although there is no
express policy with respect thereto. The Company may also offer its shares or
Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or
otherwise re-acquire its shares or any other securities in the future.

SEASONALITY

The Company’s revenues and expenses are subject to
seasonality during the year which impacts quarter-by-quarter net earnings, cash
flows and funds from operations. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically,
Toys’ fourth quarter net income, which the Company records on a one-quarter lag
basis in its first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of Toys’ fiscal year net
income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced
higher utility costs in the third quarter of the year. The Merchandise Mart
segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters
of the year due to major trade shows in those quarters. The Retail segment
revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of
percentage rental income. The Temperature Controlled Logistics segment has
experienced higher earnings in the fourth quarter due to higher activity and
occupancy in its warehouse operations due to the holiday season’s impact on the
food industry.

TENANTS ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 10% OF
REVENUES

None of the Company’s tenants represented more than
10% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

The Company’s operations and properties are subject to
various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection
of the environment including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic
substances and health and safety. Under certain of these environmental laws a
current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to
investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The
owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third
parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and
clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination. These
laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator
knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. The presence of
contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may impair the
Company’s ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real
estate as collateral. Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air
quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of
asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or
remodeling and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the
air. The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment
containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and underground storage tanks are
also regulated by federal and state laws. The Company is also subject to risks
associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as
molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be
alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in
susceptible individuals. The Company could incur fines for environmental
compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to
the foregoing regulated substances or tanks or related claims arising out of
environmental contamination or human exposure at or from the Company’s
properties.

Each of the Company’s properties has been subjected to
varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental
assessments did not reveal any environmental condition material to the
Company’s business. However, identification of new compliance concerns or
undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of
contamination, discovery of additional sites, human exposure to the
contamination or changes in cleanup or compliance requirements could result in
significant costs to the Company.


COMPETITION

The Company’s business segments – Office, Retail,
Merchandise Mart Properties, Temperature Controlled Logistics, and Toys “R” Us,
as well as its other investments, operate in highly competitive environments. The
Company has a large concentration of properties in the New York City
metropolitan area and in the Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia area. The
Company competes with a large number of real estate property owners and
developers. Principal factors of competition are rent charged, attractiveness
of location, the quality of the property and breadth and quality of services
provided. The Company’s success depends upon, among other factors, trends of
the national and local economies, financial condition and operating results of
current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of
capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations,
legislation and population trends. The Company’s interest in Toys “R” Us will
also be affected by competition from discount and mass merchandisers.

CERTAIN ACTIVITIES

Acquisitions and investments are not required to be
based on specific allocation by type of property. The Company has historically held
its properties for long-term investment; however, it is possible that
properties in the portfolio may be sold in whole or in part, as circumstances
warrant, from time to time. Further, the Company has not adopted a policy that
limits the amount or percentage of assets which would be invested in a specific
property. While the Company may seek the vote of its shareholders in connection
with any particular material transaction, generally the Company’s activities
are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by its Board of Trustees
without the vote of shareholders.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2005, the Company and its
majority-owned subsidiaries had approximately 3,015 employees, of which 269
were corporate staff. The Office segment had 107 employees and 1,286 employees
of Building Maintenance Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary. The Retail
segment, the Merchandise Mart segment, the Washington D.C. Office segment and
the Hotel Pennsylvania had 71, 511, 190 and 524 employees, respectively. The
forgoing does not include employees of partially-owned entities, including
6,459 Americold Realty Trust employees and 79,872 Toys “R” Us, Inc. employees.

SEGMENT DATA

The Company operates in five business segments: Office
Properties, Retail Properties, Merchandise Mart Properties, Temperature
Controlled Logistics and Toys “R” Us.

The Merchandise Mart segment has trade show operations
in Canada. The Temperature Controlled Logistics segment manages one warehouse
in Canada. The Toys segment operates in 306 locations internationally. In
addition, the Company has a 25% equity investment in TCG Urban Infrastructure
Holdings in India, which is included in the Other segment. Information related
to the Company’s business segments for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003 is set

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Set forth below are material factors that may
adversely affect our business and operations.

Real Estate Investments’ Value and Income Fluctuate
Due to Various Factors.

The value of real estate fluctuates depending on
conditions in the general economy and the real estate business. These
conditions may also limit our revenues and available cash.

The factors that affect the value of our real estate
include, among other things:

•

national,
regional and local economic conditions;

•

consequences
of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the United
States;

•

our
ability to secure adequate insurance;

•

local
conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real
estate in the area;

•

competition
from other available space;

•

whether
tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property
attractive;

•

the
financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies
or defaults;

•

whether
we are able to pass some or all of any increased operating costs through to
tenants;

•

how
well we manage our properties;

•

fluctuations
in interest rates;

•

changes
in real estate taxes and other expenses;

•

changes
in market rental rates;

•

the
timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;

•

changes
in taxation or zoning laws;

•

government
regulation;

•

Vornado
Realty Trust’s failure to continue to qualify as a real estate investment
trust;

•

availability
of financing on acceptable terms or at all;

•

potential
liability under environmental or other laws or regulations; and

•

general
competitive factors.

The rents we receive and the occupancy levels at our
properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors. If
our rental revenues decline, we generally would expect to have less cash
available to pay our indebtedness and distribute to our shareholders. In
addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate
taxes and maintenance costs, generally do not decline when the related rents
decline.

We depend on leasing space to tenants on economically
favorable terms and collecting rent from our tenants, who may not be able to
pay.

Our financial results depend significantly on leasing space
in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms. In addition,
because a substantial majority of our income comes from renting of real
property, our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and funds available
for distribution to our shareholders will decrease if a significant number of
our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain our levels
of occupancy on favorable terms. If a tenant does not pay its rent, we might
not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and might incur
substantial legal costs.

Bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our
revenues and available cash.

From time to time, some of our tenants have declared
bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the
future. If a major tenant declares bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, the rental
property at which it leases space may have lower revenues and operational
difficulties. In the case of our shopping centers, the bankruptcy or insolvency
of a major tenant could cause us to have difficulty leasing the remainder of
the affected property. Our leases generally do not contain restrictions
designed to ensure the creditworthiness of our tenants. As a result, the
bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could result in a lower level of net
income and funds available for distribution to our shareholders or the payment
of our indebtedness.


Real estate is a competitive business.

Our business segments – Office, Retail, Merchandise
Mart Properties, Temperature Controlled Logistics, Toys “R” Us and Other –
operate in highly competitive environments. We have a large concentration of
properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, D.C.
and Northern Virginia area. We compete with a large number of real estate
property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower
returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rent
charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and breadth
and quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other
factors, trends of the national and local economies, financial condition and
operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers,
availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes,
governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.

We may incur costs to comply with environmental laws.

Our operations and properties are subject to various
federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the
environment including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and
health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner
or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up
hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or operator may
also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property
damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred
by those parties because of the contamination. These laws often impose
liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release
of the substances or caused the release.  The presence of contamination or
the failure to remediate contamination may impair our ability to sell or lease
real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  Other laws
and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can
require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event
of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of
and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air.  The maintenance and removal
of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) and underground storage tanks are also regulated by federal
and state laws. We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to
chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and
bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to
allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. We
could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs
of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or tanks
or related claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure
at or from our properties.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying
degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental
assessments did not, as of this date, reveal any environmental condition
material to our business.  However, identification of new compliance
concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known
scope of contamination, discovery of additional sites, human exposure to the
contamination or changes in cleanup or compliance requirements could result in
significant costs to us.

Some of our potential losses may not be covered by
insurance.

We carry comprehensive liability and all risk property
insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage,
(iv) ”acts of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance
Extension Act of 2005, which expires in 2007 and (v) rental loss insurance)
with respect to our assets.  Below is a summary of the current all risk
property insurance and terrorism risk insurance in effect though September 2006
for each of the following business segments:

(1)

Limited as to terrorism insurance by the sub-limit
shown in the adjacent column.

In addition to the coverage above, we carry lesser
amounts of coverage for terrorist acts not covered by the Terrorism Risk Insurance
Extension Act of 2005.  To the extent that we incur losses in excess of
our insurance coverage, these losses would be borne by us and could be
material.


Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans
secured by our properties (which are generally non-recourse to us), Vornado
Realty L.P.’s senior unsecured notes due 2007, 2009 and 2010, exchangeable
senior debentures due 2025 and our revolving credit agreement, contain
customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance.  Although we
believe that we have adequate insurance coverage under these agreements, we may
not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in
the future.  Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are
able to obtain, or if the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension of 2005 is not
extended past 2007, it could adversely affect our ability to finance and/or
refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Because
we operate one hotel property, we face the risks associated with the
hospitality industry.

We own the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City. If the
hotel does not generate sufficient receipts, our cash flow would be decreased,
which could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our
shareholders. The following factors, among others, are common to the hotel
industry, and may reduce the revenues generated by our hotel property:

•

our hotel competes for guests with other
hotels, a number of which have greater marketing and financial resources;

•

if there is an increase in operating costs
resulting from inflation and other factors, we may not be able to offset such
increase by increasing room rates;

•

our hotel is subject to the fluctuating and
seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism;

•

our hotel is subject to general and local
economic and social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general,
including war and terrorism; and

•

physical condition, which may require
substantial additional capital.

Because of the ownership structure of our hotel, we
face potential adverse effects from changes to the applicable tax laws.

Under the Internal Revenue Code, REITs like us are not
allowed to operate hotels directly or indirectly. Accordingly, we lease The
Hotel Pennsylvania to our taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS. While the TRS
structure allows the economic benefits of ownership to flow to us, the TRS is
subject to tax on its income from the operations of the hotel at the federal
and state level. In addition, the TRS is subject to detailed tax regulations
that affect how it may be capitalized and operated. If the tax laws applicable
to TRS’s are modified, we may be forced to modify the structure for owning the
hotel, and such changes may adversely affect the cash flows from the hotel. In
addition, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department
and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, and we cannot
predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations,
interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any of such actions may
prospectively or retroactively modify the tax treatment of the TRS and,
therefore, may adversely affect our after-tax returns from the hotel.

Compliance or
failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety
regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.

The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires
that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled
persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal
government or the award of damages to private litigants. From time to time
persons have asserted claims against us with respect to some of our properties
under this Act, but to date such claims have not resulted in any material
expense or liability. If, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are
required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or
more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as
the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders.

Our properties are subject to various federal, state
and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety
requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur
fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements
will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant
unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of
operations.


Our Investments Are Concentrated in the New York and
Washington D.C. Metropolitan Areas.  Circumstances Affecting These Areas
Generally Could Adversely Affect Our Business.

A significant portion of our properties are in the New
York City/New Jersey and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas and are affected
by the economic cycles and risks inherent to those areas.

During 2005, approximately 73% of our EBITDA excluding
items that affect comparability, came from properties located in New Jersey and
the New York City and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas.  In
addition, we may continue to concentrate a significant portion of our future
acquisitions in New Jersey and the New York City and Washington, D.C.
metropolitan areas.  Like other real estate markets, the real estate
markets in these areas have experienced economic downturns in the past, and we
cannot predict how economic conditions will impact these markets in both the
short and long term.  Declines in the economy or a decline in the real
estate markets in these areas could hurt our financial performance and the
value of our properties.  The factors affecting economic conditions in
these regions include:

•

space
needs of the United States Government, including the effect of base closures
and repositioning under the

Defense Base Closure and
Realignment Act of 1990, as amended;

•

business
layoffs or downsizing;

•

industry
slowdowns;

•

relocations
of businesses;

•

changing
demographics;

•

increased
telecommuting and use of alternative work places;

•

financial
performance and productivity of the publishing, advertising, financial,
technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries;

•

infrastructure
quality; and

•

any
oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.

It is impossible for us to assess the future effects
of the current uncertain trends in the economic and investment climates of the
New York City/New Jersey and Washington, D.C. regions, and more generally of
the United States, or the real estate markets in these areas.  If these
conditions persist or if there is any local, national or global economic
downturn, our businesses and future profitability may be adversely affected.

Terrorist attacks, such as those of September 11,
2001 in New York City and the Washington, D.C. area, may adversely affect the
value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.

We have significant investments in large metropolitan
areas, including the New York, Washington, D.C. and Chicago metropolitan
areas.  In the aftermath of any terrorist attacks, tenants in these areas
may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas
of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future
terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in
these areas.  This in turn would trigger a decrease in the demand for
space in these areas, which could increase vacancies in our properties and
force us to lease our properties on less favorable terms.  As a result,
the value of our properties and the level of our revenues could decline
materially.

We May Acquire or Sell Additional Assets or
Develop Additional Properties.  Our Failure or Inability to Consummate
These Transactions or Manage the Results of These Transactions Could Adversely
Affect Our Operations and Financial Results.

We have grown rapidly through acquisitions.  We
may not be able to maintain this rapid growth and our failure to do so could
adversely affect our stock price.

We have experienced rapid growth in recent years,
increasing our total assets from approximately $565 million at
December 31, 1996 to approximately $13.6 billion at December 31,
2005.  We may not be able to maintain a similar rate of growth in the
future or manage our growth effectively.  Our failure to do so may have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations
and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.


We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other
real estate related companies and this may create risks.

We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other
real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or
development is consistent with our business strategies.  We may not,
however, succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing
developments on time or within budget. In addition, we may face competition in
pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our
costs. When we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in
leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover
their costs of acquisition or development and operations.  Difficulties in
integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert
management’s attention. Acquisitions or developments in new markets or
industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result
in poorer than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition or
development opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to
recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter
not consummated. Furthermore, our acquisitions of new properties or companies
will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of
which we may not be aware at the time of acquisition. In addition, development
of our existing properties presents similar risks.

It may be difficult to buy and sell real estate
quickly.

Real estate investments are relatively difficult to
buy and sell quickly.  Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary
our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.

We may not be permitted to dispose of certain
properties or pay down the debt associated with those properties when we might
otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs.

As part of an acquisition of a property, including our
January 1, 2002, acquisition of Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P.’s
13.0 million square foot portfolio, we may agree, and in the case of Charles E.
Smith Commercial Realty L.P. did agree, with the seller that we will not
dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on them
for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax
costs of the seller.  These agreements could result in our holding on to
properties that we would otherwise sell and not pay down or refinance
indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance.

On January 1, 2002, we completed the acquisition
of the 66% interest in Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P. that we did not
previously own.  The terms of the merger restrict our ability to sell or
otherwise dispose of, or to finance or refinance, the properties formerly owned
by Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P., which could result in our inability
to sell these properties at an opportune time and increased costs to us.

Subject to limited exceptions, we are restricted from
selling or otherwise transferring or disposing of certain properties located in
the Crystal City area of Arlington, Virginia or an interest in our division
that manages the majority of our office properties in the Washington, D.C.
metropolitan area, which we refer to as the Washington D.C. Office Division,
for a period of 12 years with respect to certain properties located in the
Crystal City area of Arlington, Virginia or six years with respect to an
interest in the Washington D.C. Office Division.  These restrictions,
which currently cover approximately 13.0 million square feet of space, could
result in our inability to sell these properties or an interest in the Washington
D.C. Office Division at an opportune time and increase costs to us.


From time to time we make investments in companies
over which we do not have sole control. Some of these companies operate in
industries that differ from our current operations, with different risks than
investing in real estate.

From time to time we make debt or equity investments
in other companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole
control.  These investments include but are not limited to:  a 33%
interest in Alexander’s, Inc.; a 15.8% interest in The Newkirk Master
Limited Partnership; a 11.3% interest in GMH Communities L.P.; a 1.3% common
equity interest in Sears Holdings Corporation; a 1.2% common equity interest in
McDonalds Corporation; a 7.0% common equity interest in Sears Canada, Inc.; and
equity and mezzanine investments in other real estate related companies. 
In addition, on July 21, 2005, a joint venture that we own equally with
Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. acquired Toys “R”
Us, Inc.  Although they generally have a significant real estate
component, several of these entities operate in businesses that are different
from our line of business including, without limitation, operating or managing
toy stores, department stores, fast food restaurants, refrigerated warehouses
and student and military housing facilities. Consequently, our investment in
these businesses, among other risks, subjects us to the operating and financial
risks of industries other than real estate and to the risk that we do not have
sole control over the operations of these businesses.  From time to time
we may (or may seek to) make additional investments in or acquire other
entities that may subject us to additional similar risks. Our investments in
entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures,
present additional risks such as our having differing objectives than our
partners or the entities in which we invest or our becoming involved in disputes
or competing with those persons. In addition, we rely on the internal controls
and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to comply
with applicable standards may adversely affect us.

We are subject to risks that affect the general retail
environment.

A substantial proportion of our properties are in the
retail shopping center real estate market and we have a significant investment
in retailers such as Toys “R” Us, Inc. See “

Our
investment in Toys “R” Us, Inc. subjects us to risks different from our other
lines of business and may result in increased seasonality and volatility in our
reported earnings

” below. This means that we are subject to factors
that affect the retail environment generally, including the level of consumer
spending and consumer confidence, the threat of terrorism and increasing
competition from discount retailers, outlet malls, retail websites and catalog
companies. These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our
retail tenants and the retailers in which we hold an investment and the
willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers.

We depend upon our anchor tenants to attract shoppers.

We own several regional malls and other shopping
centers that are typically anchored by well-known department stores and other
tenants who generate shopping traffic at the mall or shopping center. The value
of our properties would be adversely affected if tenants or anchors failed to
meet their contractual obligations, sought concessions in order to continue
operations or ceased their operations. If the sales of stores operating in our
properties were to decline significantly due to economic conditions, closing of
anchors or for other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents
or expense recovery charges. In the event of a default by a tenant or anchor,
we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord.

Our investment in Toys
“R” Us, Inc. subjects us to risks different from our other lines of business and
may result in increased seasonality and volatility in our reported earnings.

On July 21, 2005, a joint venture that we own
equally with Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. acquired
Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”). Because Toys is a retailer, its operations
subject us to the risks of a retail company that are different than those
presented by our other lines of business. The business of Toys is highly
seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than
80% of its fiscal year net income. In addition, our fiscal year ends on
December 31 whereas, as is common for retailers, Toys’ fiscal year ends on
the Saturday nearest to January 31. Therefore, we record our pro-rata
share of Toys’ net income (loss) on a one quarter-lag basis.  For example,
our financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005
include Toys’ financial results for their third quarter ended October 29,
2005, and our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2006 will
include Toys’ financial results for its first, second and third quarters ended
October 28, 2006, as well as Toys’ fourth quarter results of 2005. Because
of the seasonality of Toys, our reported net income will likely show increased
volatility.


Our Organizational and Financial Structure Gives Rise
to Operational and Financial Risks.

We May Not Be Able to Obtain Capital to Make
Investments.

We depend primarily on external financing to fund the
growth of our business.  This is because one of the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for a REIT is that it distribute 90%
of its net taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its shareholders. There
is a separate requirement to distribute net capital gains or pay a corporate
level tax in lieu thereof.  Our access to debt or equity financing depends
on the willingness of third parties to lend or make equity investments and on
conditions in the capital markets generally.  We and other companies in
the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing
from time to time.  Although we believe that we will be able to finance
any investments we may wish to make in the foreseeable future, new financing
may not be available on acceptable terms.

For information about our available sources of funds,
see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and the notes to the consolidated
financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Vornado Realty Trust depends on dividends and
distributions from its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The creditors and
preferred security holders of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts
payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any
dividends or distributions to Vornado Realty Trust.

Substantially all of Vornado Realty Trust’s assets are
held through its Operating Partnership that holds substantially all of its
properties and assets through subsidiaries.  The Operating Partnership
depends for substantially all of its cash flow on cash distributions to it by
its subsidiaries, and Vornado Realty Trust in turn depends for substantially
all of its cash flow on cash distributions to it by the Operating
Partnership.  The creditors of each of Vornado Realty Trust’s direct and
indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations
to them, when due and payable, before distributions may be made by that
subsidiary to its equity holders.  Thus, the Operating Partnership’s
ability to make distributions to holders of its units depends on its
subsidiaries’ ability first to satisfy their obligations to their creditors and
then to make distributions to the Operating Partnership.  Likewise,
Vornado Realty Trust’s ability to pay dividends to holders of common and
preferred shares depends on the Operating Partnership’s ability first to
satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions payable to
holders of preferred units and then to make distributions to Vornado Realty
Trust.

Furthermore, the holders of preferred units of the
Operating Partnership are entitled to receive preferred distributions before
payment of distributions to holders of common units of the Operating
Partnership, including Vornado Realty Trust.  Thus, Vornado Realty Trust’s
ability to pay dividends to holders of its shares and satisfy its debt
obligations depends on the Operating Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its
obligations to its creditors and make distributions payable to holders of
preferred units and then to make distributions to Vornado Realty Trust. 
As of December 31, 2005, there were nine series of preferred units of the
Operating Partnership not held by Vornado Realty Trust that have preference
over Vornado Realty Trust common shares with a total liquidation value of
$402,405,000.

In addition, Vornado Realty Trust’s participation in
any distribution of the assets of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries
upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency, is only after the claims of
the creditors, including trade creditors, and preferred security holders, if
any, of the applicable direct or indirect subsidiaries are satisfied.

We have indebtedness, and this indebtedness, and its
cost, may increase.

As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $6.3
billion in total debt outstanding.  Our ratio of total debt to total
enterprise value was approximately 35.6%.  When we say “enterprise value”
in the preceding sentence, we mean market equity value of Vornado Realty Trust’s
common and preferred shares plus total debt outstanding, including our pro rata
share of the debt of partially-owned entities.  In the future, we may
incur additional debt, and thus increase our ratio of total debt to total
enterprise value, to finance acquisitions or property developments. If our
level of indebtedness increases, there may be an increased risk of default on
our obligations that could adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations. In addition, in a rising interest rate environment, the cost of
our floating rate debt and any new debt or other market rate security or
instrument may increase.


Covenants in our debt instruments could adversely
affect our financial condition and our acquisitions and development activities.

The mortgages on our properties contain customary
covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of
the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue
insurance coverage. Our unsecured credit facility, unsecured debt securities
and other loans that we may obtain in the future contain customary
restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur
indebtedness, including covenants that limit our ability to incur debt based
upon the level of our ratio of total debt to total assets, our ratio of secured
debt to total assets, our ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, and fixed
charges, and that require us to maintain a certain level of unencumbered assets
to unsecured debt. Our ability to borrow under our credit facilities is subject
to compliance with certain financial and other covenants. In addition, failure
to comply with our covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt
instrument, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from
other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be
available to us, or be available only on unattractive terms. Additionally, our
ability to satisfy current or prospective lenders’ insurance requirements may
be adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon greater insurance
coverage against acts of terrorism than is available to us in the marketplace
or on commercially reasonable terms.

We rely on debt financing, including borrowings under
our unsecured credit facility, issuances of unsecured debt securities and debt
secured by individual properties, to finance our acquisition and development
activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt financing
from these or other sources, or to refinance existing indebtedness upon
maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be
adversely affected. If we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders
can declare a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of the
property securing the defaulted loan.

Vornado Realty Trust might fail to qualify or remain
qualified as a REIT and may be required to pay income taxes at corporate rates.

Although we believe that we will remain organized and
will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes, we might fail to remain qualified in this way.  Qualification as
a REIT for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and
complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only
limited judicial or administrative interpretations.  Our qualification as
a REIT also depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely
within our control. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative
interpretations or court decisions might significantly change the tax laws with
respect to the requirements for qualification as a REIT or the federal income
tax consequences of qualification as a REIT.

If, with respect to any taxable year, Vornado Realty
Trust fails to maintain its qualification as a REIT and does not qualify under
statutory relief provisions, it could not deduct distributions to shareholders
in computing its taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on its
taxable income at regular corporate rates.  The federal income tax payable
would include any applicable alternative minimum tax.  If Vornado Realty
Trust had to pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute
to shareholders and pay its indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years
involved, and Vornado Realty Trust would no longer be required to distribute
money to shareholders.  In addition, Vornado Realty Trust would also be
disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the
year during which qualification was lost, unless it was entitled to relief
under the relevant statutory provisions.  Although Vornado Realty Trust
currently intends to operate in a manner designed to allow it to qualify as a
REIT, future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause it
to revoke the REIT election or fail to qualify as a REIT.

We face possible adverse changes in tax laws.

From time to time changes in state and local tax laws
or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax
liability. The shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in
recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes.
If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets
or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for
payment of dividends.

Loss of our key personnel could harm our operations
and adversely affect the value of our common shares.

We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, the
Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado Realty
Trust, and Michael D. Fascitelli, the President of Vornado Realty Trust. While
we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of
their services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our
common shares.


Vornado Realty Trust’s charter documents and applicable law
may hinder any attempt to acquire us.

Our Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust sets
limits on the ownership of our shares.

Generally, for Vornado Realty Trust to maintain its
qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% in
value of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of Vornado Realty Trust
may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time
during the last half of Vornado Realty Trust’s taxable year.  The Internal
Revenue Code defines “individuals” for purposes of the requirement described in
the preceding sentence to include some types of entities.  Under Vornado
Realty Trust’s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as amended, no person
may own more than 6.7% of the outstanding common shares of any class, or 9.9%
of the outstanding preferred shares of any class, with some exceptions for
persons who held common shares in excess of the 6.7% limit before Vornado Realty
Trust adopted the limit and other persons approved by Vornado Realty Trust’s
Board of Trustees.  These restrictions on transferability and ownership
may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado Realty Trust or
other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the
best interest of the shareholders.  We refer to Vornado Realty Trust’s
Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as amended, as the “declaration of
trust.”

We have a classified Board of Trustees and that may
reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Vornado Realty Trust’s Board of Trustees is divided
into three classes of trustees.  Trustees of each class are chosen for
three-year staggered terms. Staggered terms of trustees may reduce the possibility
of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of Vornado Realty Trust, even
though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of
Vornado Realty Trust’s shareholders.

We may issue additional shares in a manner that could adversely
affect the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Vornado Realty Trust’s declaration of trust authorizes
the Board of Trustees to:

•

cause
Vornado Realty Trust to issue additional authorized but unissued common shares
or preferred shares;

•

classify
or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred shares;

•

set
the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified
shares that Vornado Realty Trust issues; and

•

increase,
without shareholder approval, the number of shares of beneficial interest that
Vornado Realty Trust may issue.

The Board of Trustees could establish a series of
preferred shares whose terms could delay, deter or prevent a change in control
of Vornado Realty Trust or other transaction that might involve a premium price
or otherwise be in the best interest of Vornado Realty Trust’s shareholders,
although the Board of Trustees does not now intend to establish a series of
preferred shares of this kind. Vornado Realty Trust’s declaration of trust and
bylaws contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in
control of Vornado Realty Trust or other transaction that might involve a
premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders.

The Maryland General Corporation Law contains
provisions that may reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, as
amended, which we refer to as the “MGCL,” as applicable to real estate
investment trusts, certain “business combinations,” including certain mergers,
consolidations, share exchanges and asset transfers and certain issuances and
reclassifications of equity securities, between a Maryland real estate
investment trust and any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of
the voting power of the trust’s shares or an affiliate or an associate, as
defined in the MGCL, of the trust who, at any time within the two-year period
before the date in question, was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of
the voting power of the then outstanding voting shares of beneficial interest
of the trust, which we refer to as an “interested shareholder,” or an affiliate
of the interested shareholder, are prohibited for five years after the most
recent date on which the interested shareholder becomes an interested
shareholder.  After that five-year period, any business combination of
these kinds must be recommended by the board of trustees of the trust and
approved by the affirmative vote of at least (a) 80% of the votes entitled
to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of beneficial interest of the trust
and (b) two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting
shares of the trust other than shares held by the interested shareholder with
whom, or with whose affiliate, the business combination is to be effected,
unless, among other conditions, the trust’s common shareholders receive a
minimum price, as defined in the MGCL, for their shares and the consideration
is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested
shareholder for its common shares.  The provisions of the MGCL do not
apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the
board of trustees of the applicable trust before the interested shareholder
becomes an interested shareholder, and a person is not an interested
shareholder if the board of trustees approved in advance the transaction by
which the person otherwise would have become an interested shareholder.


In approving a
transaction, the board may provide that its approval is subject to compliance,
at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by
the board.  Vornado Realty Trust’s Board has adopted a resolution
exempting any business combination between any trustee or officer of Vornado
Realty Trust, or their affiliates, and Vornado Realty Trust.  As a result,
the trustees and officers of Vornado Realty Trust and their affiliates may be
able to enter into business combinations with Vornado Realty Trust that may not
be in the best interest of shareholders.  With respect to business
combinations with other persons, the business combination provisions of the
MGCL may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control
of Vornado Realty Trust or other transaction that might involve a premium price
or otherwise be in the best interest of the shareholders.  The business
combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of
Vornado Realty Trust and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.

We may change our policies without obtaining the
approval of our shareholders.

Our operating and financial policies, including our
policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other companies,
growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively
determined by our Board of Trustees. Accordingly, our shareholders do not
control these policies.

Our Ownership Structure and Related-Party Transactions
May Give Rise to Conflicts of Interest.

Steven Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise
substantial influence over us.  They and some of our other trustees and
officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with
us.

As of December 31, 2005, Interstate Properties, a New
Jersey general partnership, and its partners owned approximately 9.2% of the
common shares of Vornado Realty Trust and approximately 27.7% of the common
stock of Alexander’s, Inc.  Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell
B. Wight, Jr. are the three partners of Interstate Properties. 
Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of
Vornado Realty Trust, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties and
the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s. 
Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are trustees of Vornado Realty Trust and also
directors of Alexander’s.

As of December 31, 2005, the Operating Partnership
owned 33% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s.  Alexander’s is
a REIT engaged in leasing, managing, developing and redeveloping properties,
focusing primarily on the locations where its department stores operated before
they ceased operations in 1992.  Alexander’s has six properties, which are
located in the New York City metropolitan area.  Mr. Roth and
Mr. Fascitelli, the President and a trustee of Vornado Realty Trust, are
directors of Alexander’s. Messrs. Mandelbaum, West and Wight are trustees
of Vornado Realty Trust and are directors of Alexander’s.

Because of these overlapping interests, Mr. Roth
and Interstate Properties and its partners may have substantial influence over
Vornado Realty Trust and Alexander’s and on the outcome of any matters
submitted to Vornado Realty Trust or Alexander’s shareholders for approval. 
In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure
may present conflicts of interest among Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight
and Interstate Properties and our other equity or debt holders.  In
addition, Mr. Roth and Interstate Properties and its partners currently
and may in the future engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate
business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters
affecting us or Alexander’s, such as which of these entities or persons, if
any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus
of these entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in which
these entities make investments, potential competition between business
activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, by us, Interstate Properties
and Alexander’s, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate
transactions such as acquisitions and other strategic decisions affecting the
future of these entities.

Vornado Realty Trust currently manages and leases the
real estate assets of Interstate Properties under a management agreement for
which it receives an annual fee equal to 4% of base rent and percentage rent
and certain other commissions.  The management agreement has a term of one
year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties
on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term.  Vornado Realty Trust earned
$791,000, $726,000, and $703,000 of management fees under the management
agreement for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. 
Because of the relationship among Vornado Realty Trust, Interstate Properties
and Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight, as described above, the terms of the
management agreement and any future agreements between Vornado Realty Trust and
Interstate Properties may not be comparable to those Vornado Realty Trust could
have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.


There may be conflicts of interest between Alexander’s
and us.

As of December 31, 2005, the Operating Partnership
owned 33% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s.  Alexander’s is
a REIT engaged in leasing, managing, developing and redeveloping properties,
focusing primarily on the locations where its department stores operated before
they ceased operations in 1992.  Alexander’s has six properties. 
Interstate Properties, which is described above, and its partners owned an
additional 27.7% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s, as of December
31, 2005.  Mr. Roth, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer of Vornado Realty Trust, is Chief Executive Officer, a director of
Alexander’s and managing general partner of Interstate, and
Mr. Fascitelli, President and a trustee of Vornado Realty Trust, is
President and a director of Alexander’s.  Messrs. Mandelbaum, West
and Wight, trustees of the Company, are also directors of Alexander’s and
general partners of Interstate.  Alexander’s common stock is listed on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “ALX.”

The Operating Partnership manages, develops and leases
the Alexander’s properties under management and development agreements and
leasing agreements under which the Operating Partnership receives annual fees
from Alexander’s.  These agreements have a one-year term expiring in
March of each year, except that the Lexington Avenue management and
development agreements have a term lasting until substantial completion of
development of the Lexington Avenue property, and are all automatically
renewable.  Because Vornado Realty Trust and Alexander’s share common
senior management and because a majority of the trustees of Vornado Realty
Trust also constitute the majority of the directors of Alexander’s, the terms
of the foregoing agreements and any future agreements between us and Alexander’s
may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated
third party.

For a description of Interstate Properties’ ownership
of Vornado Realty Trust and Alexander’s, see

“Steven
Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise substantial influence over
us.  They and some of our other trustees and officers have interests or
positions in other entities that may compete with us”

above.

The Number of Shares of Vornado Realty Trust and the
Market for Those Shares Give Rise to Various Risks.

Vornado Realty Trust has many shares available for
future sale, which could hurt the market price of its shares.

As of December 31, 2005, we had authorized but
unissued, 58,846,570 common shares of beneficial interest, $.04 par value, and
70,310,600 preferred shares of beneficial interest, no par value, of which
25,381,264 preferred shares have not been reserved and remain available for
issuance as a newly-designated class of preferred.  We may issue these
authorized but unissued shares from time to time in public or private offerings
or in connection with acquisitions.

In addition, as of December 31, 2005, 15,333,673
Vornado Realty Trust common shares were reserved for issuance upon redemption
of Operating Partnership common units.  Some of these shares may be sold
in the public market after registration under the Securities Act under
registration rights agreements between Vornado Realty Trust and some holders of
common units of the Operating Partnership.  These shares may also be sold
in the public market under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or other
available exemptions from registration.  In addition, Vornado Realty Trust
has reserved a number of common shares for issuance under its employee benefit
plans, and these common shares will be available for sale from time to
time.  Vornado Realty Trust has awarded shares of restricted stock and
granted options to purchase additional common shares to some of its executive
officers and employees. Of the authorized but unissued common and preferred
shares above, 43,694,714 common and 44,929,336 preferred shares, in the
aggregate, were reserved for issuance of shares upon the redemption of
Operating Partnership units, conversion of outstanding convertible securities,
under benefit plans or for other activity not directly under our control.

We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our
common shares, preferred shares or Operating Partnership common units, or the
perception that sales of common shares, preferred or Operating Partnership
common units could occur, will have on the market prices for Vornado Realty
Trust’s shares.


Changes in market conditions could hurt the market
price of Vornado Realty Trust’s shares.

The value of Vornado Realty Trust’s shares depends on
various market conditions, which may change from time to time. Among the market
conditions that may affect the value of Vornado Realty Trust’s shares are the
following:

•

the
extent of institutional investor interest in us;

•

the
reputation of REITs generally and the attractiveness of their equity securities
in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other
real estate companies, and fixed income securities;

•

our
financial condition and performance; and

•

general
financial market conditions.

The stock market in recent years has experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or
disproportionate to the operating performance of companies.

Increased market interest rates may hurt the value of
Vornado Realty Trust’s shares.

We believe that investors consider the distribution rate on REIT
shares, expressed as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to
market interest rates as an important factor in deciding whether to buy or sell
the shares.  If market interest rates go up, prospective purchasers of
REIT shares may expect a higher distribution rate.  Higher interest rates
would likely increase our borrowing costs and might decrease funds available

The following
table sets forth the Company’s original plan to re-lease the PTO space and the
space leased through February 1, 2006.

(1)    Crystal Plaza Two, a 13-story office
building, was taken out of service to be converted to a 19-story residential
tower containing 265 rentable/saleable square feet and 256 apartments. The original
plan assumed that this building would remain an office building to be re-leased
in Q1 06.

Of the square feet leased to larger tenants, 261,000
square feet was leased to the Federal Supply Service (which will relocate from
240,000 square feet in other Crystal City buildings); 144,000 square feet was
leased to KBR, a defense contractor; and 126,000 square feet was leased to the
Public Broadcasting Service. 
Straight-line rent per square foot for the square feet leased is $33.50,
which is equal to the estimate in the original plan.  Tenant improvements and leasing commissions
per square foot are $43.50 as compared to the original plan of $45.28.

including 180,000 square feet to be built by Target on land leased from the
Company. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has taken 480,000 square feet out

ITEM 3.

actions arising in the ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of
management, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters,
including in respect of the matter referred to below, is not expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of
operations.

Stop & Shop

On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a
complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
(“USDC-NJ”) claiming the Company has no right to reallocate and therefore
continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop
pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the
East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases
to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated. Stop &
Shop asserted that a prior order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York dated February 6, 2001, as modified on appeal to the
District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 13, 2001,
froze the Company’s right to re-allocate which effectively terminated the
Company’s right to collect the additional rent from Stop & Shop. On March
3, 2003, after the Company moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Stop
& Shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint. On March 26, 2003, Stop &
Shop filed a new complaint in New York Supreme Court, asserting substantially
the same claims as in its USDC-NJ complaint. The Company removed the action to
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In
January 2005 that court remanded the action to the New York Supreme Court. On
February 14, 2005, the Company served an answer in which it asserted a
counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing
through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will
continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases
subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect. On May 17, 2005,
the Company filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop &
Shop opposed the Company’s motion and filed a cross-motion for summary
judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the
motions for summary judgment. The Company intends to pursue its claims against
Stop & Shop vigorously.

H Street Building
Corporation (“H Street”)

On July 22, 2005, two corporations owned 50% by H
Street filed a complaint against the Company, H Street and three parties
affiliated with the sellers of H Street in the Superior Court of the District
of Columbia alleging that the Company encouraged H Street and the affiliated
parties to breach their fiduciary duties to these corporations and interfered
with prospective business and contractual relationships. The complaint seeks an
unspecified amount of damages and a rescission of the Company’s acquisition of
H Street. In addition, on July 29, 2005, a tenant under a ground lease with one
of these corporations brought a separate suit in the Superior Court of the
District of Columbia, alleging, among other things, that the Company’s
acquisition of H Street violated a provision giving them a right of first offer
and on that basis seeks a rescission of the Company’s acquisition and the right
to acquire H Street for the price paid by the Company. On September 12, 2005,
the Company filed a complaint against each of these corporations and their
acting directors seeking a restoration of H Street’s full shareholder rights
and damages. These legal actions are currently in the discovery stage. The
Company believes that the actions filed against the Company are without merit
and that it will ultimately be successful in defending against them.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA:

See notes on the
following page.


(1)

Operating results for the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 reflect the consolidation of the
Company’s investment in Americold Realty Trust beginning on November 18, 2004. Previously,
this investment was accounted for on the equity method.

(2)

Operating results for the
year ended December 31, 2002, reflect the Company’s January 1, 2002
acquisition of the remaining 66% of Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty
L.P. (“CESCR”) and the resulting consolidation of CESCR’s operations.

(3)

FFO is computed in
accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT
defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), excluding extraordinary items as defined under
GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real
estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset
depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated
partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is used by management, investors and
industry analysts as a supplemental measure of operating performance of equity
REITs. FFO should be evaluated along with GAAP net income (the most directly
comparable GAAP measure), as well as cash flow from operating activities,
investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating
performance of equity REITs. Management believes that FFO is helpful to
investors as a supplemental performance measure because this measure excludes
the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real
estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes
that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real
estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions,
this non-GAAP measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance
between periods and among other equity REITs. FFO does not represent cash
generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not
necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in the
Company’s Statements of Cash Flows. FFO should not be considered as an
alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company’s operating
performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Overview

The Company owns and
operates office, retail and showroom properties with large concentrations of
office and retail properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the
Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia area. In addition, the Company has a
47.6% interest in an entity that owns and operates 85 cold storage warehouses
nationwide and a 32.95% interest in Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”) which has a
significant real estate component, as well as other real estate and related
investments.

The Company’s business
objective is to maximize shareholder value. The Company measures its success in
meeting this objective by the total return to its shareholders. Below is a
table comparing the Company’s performance to the Morgan Stanley REIT Index
(“RMS”) for the following periods ending December 31, 2005:

(1)

Past performance is not necessarily indicative of how
the Company will perform in the future.

(2)

From inception on July 25, 1995

The Company intends to
achieve its business objective by continuing to pursue its investment
philosophy and executing its operating strategies through:

•

Maintaining
a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial
spirit;

•

Investing
in properties in select markets, such as New York City and
Washington, D.C., where we believe there is high likelihood of capital
appreciation;

•

Acquiring
quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a
significant potential for higher rents;

•

Investing
in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City
metropolitan area;

•

Investing
in fully-integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate
component;

•

Developing
and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize
value; and

•

Providing
specialty financing to real estate related companies.

The Company competes with
a large number of real estate property owners and developers. Principal factors
of competition are rent charged, attractiveness of location and quality and
breadth of services provided. The Company’s success depends upon, among other
factors, trends of the national and local economies, financial condition and
operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers,
availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes,
governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. Economic growth
has been fostered, in part, by low interest rates, Federal tax cuts, and
increases in government spending. To the extent economic growth stalls, the
Company may experience lower occupancy rates which may lead to lower initial
rental rates, higher leasing costs and a corresponding decrease in net income,
funds from operations and cash flow. Alternatively, if economic growth is
sustained, the Company may experience higher occupancy rates leading to higher
initial rents and higher interest rates causing an increase in the Company’s
weighted average cost of capital and a corresponding effect on net income,
funds from operations and cash flow. The Company’s net income and funds from
operations will also be affected by the seasonality of the Toys’ business and
competition from discount and mass merchandisers.

2005 Acquisitions and Investments

On March 5, 2005, the Company acquired a 50% interest
in a venture that owns Beverly Connection, a two-level urban shopping center,
containing 322,000 square feet, located in Los Angeles, California for
$10,700,000 in cash. The Company also provided the venture with a $59,500,000
first mortgage loan which bore interest at 10% through its scheduled maturity
in February 2006 and $35,000,000 of preferred equity yielding 13.5% for up to a
three-year term, which is subordinate to $37,200,000 of other preferred equity
and debt. On February 11, 2006, $35,000,000 of the Company’s loan to the
venture was converted to additional preferred equity on the same terms as the
Company’s existing preferred equity. The balance of the loan of $24,500,000 was
extended to April 11, 2006 and bears interest at 10%. The shopping center is
anchored by CompUSA, Old Navy and Sports Chalet. The venture is redeveloping
the existing retail and plans, subject to governmental approvals, to develop
residential condominiums and assisted living facilities. This investment is
accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company records its
pro rata share of net income or loss in Beverly Connection on a one-month lag
basis as the Company files its consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K
and 10-Q prior to the time the venture reports its earnings.

On January 31, 2006, the Company closed on an option
to

purchase the
1.4 million square foot Springfield Mall which is located on 79 acres at
the intersection of Interstate 95 and Franconia Road in Springfield, Fairfax
County, Virginia, and is anchored by Macy’s, and J.C. Penney and Target, who

option was $35,600,000, of which the Company paid $14,000,000 in cash at
closing and the remainder of $21,600,000 will be paid in installments over four
years. The Company intends to redevelop, reposition and re-tenant the mall and
has committed to spend $25,000,000 in capital expenditures over a six-year
period from the closing of the option agreement. The option becomes exercisable
upon the passing of one of the existing principals of the selling entity and

mall and right to the mall’s net cash flow. Accordingly, the Company will
consolidate the accounts of the mall into its financial position and results of
operations pursuant to the provisions of FIN 46R. The Company has a 2.5%
minority partner in this transaction.

Investment in H Street Building Corporation (“H
Street”)

On July 20, 2005, the Company acquired H Street, which
owns directly or indirectly through stock ownership in corporations, a 50%
interest in real estate assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia, including 34
acres of land leased to various residential and retail operators, a 1,670 unit
apartment complex, 10 acres of land and two office buildings located in
Washington, DC containing 577,000 square feet. The purchase price was
approximately $246,600,000, consisting of $194,500,000 in cash and
$52,100,000 for the Company’s pro rata share of existing mortgage debt. The
operations of H Street are consolidated into the accounts of the Company from
the date of acquisition.

On July 22, 2005, two corporations owned 50% by H
Street filed a complaint against the Company, H Street and three parties
affiliated with the sellers of H Street in the Superior Court of the District
of Columbia alleging that the Company encouraged H Street and the affiliated
parties to breach their fiduciary duties to these corporations and interfered
with prospective business and contractual relationships. The complaint seeks an
unspecified amount of damages and a rescission of the Company’s acquisition of
H Street. In addition, on July 29, 2005, a tenant under a ground lease with one
of these corporations brought a separate suit in the Superior Court of the
District of Columbia, alleging, among other things, that the Company’s
acquisition of H Street violated a provision giving them a right of first offer
and on that basis seeks a rescission of the Company’s acquisition and the right
to acquire H Street for the price paid by the Company. On September 12, 2005,
the Company filed a complaint against each of these corporations and their
acting directors seeking a restoration of H Street’s full shareholder rights
and damages. These legal actions are currently in the discovery stage.

In connection with these legal actions, the
Company has accrued legal fees of $2,134,000 in the fourth quarter of 2005,
which are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated
statement of income.

The Company believes that the actions filed against
the Company are without merit and that it will ultimately be successful in
defending against them.

Because of the legal actions described above, the
Company has not been granted access to the financial information of these two
corporations and accordingly has not recorded its share of their net income or
loss or disclosed its

pro
rata share of their outstanding debt in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.


Investment in Toys “R” Us (“Toys”)

On July 21, 2005, a joint venture owned equally by the
Company, Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. acquired Toys for
$26.75 per share in cash or approximately $6.6 billion. In connection
therewith, the Company invested $428,000,000 of the $1.3 billion of equity in
the venture, consisting of $407,000,000 in cash and $21,000,000 in Toys common
shares held by the Company. This investment is accounted for under the equity
method of accounting.

The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically,
Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year
net income. Because Toys’ fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31,
the Company records its 32.95% share of Toys net income or loss on a
one-quarter lag basis. Accordingly, the Company will record its share of Toys
fourth quarter net income in its first quarter of 2006. Equity in net loss from
Toys for the period from July 21, 2005 (date of acquisition) through December
31, 2005 was $40,496,000, which consisted of (i) the Company’s $1,977,000 share
of Toys net loss in Toys’ second quarter ended July 30, 2005 for the period
from July 21, 2005 (date of acquisition) through July 30, 2005, (ii) the
Company’s $44,812,000 share of Toys net loss in Toys’ third quarter ended
October 29, 2005, partially offset by, (iii) $5,043,000 of interest income on
the Company’s senior unsecured bridge loan described below and (iv) $1,250,000
of management fees.

On August 29, 2005, the Company acquired $150,000,000
of the $1.9 billion one-year senior unsecured bridge loan financing provided to
Toys. The loan is senior to the acquisition equity of $1.3 billion and $1.6
billion of existing debt. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 5.25% (9.43% as
of December 31, 2005) not to exceed 11% and provides for an initial .375%
placement fee and additional fees of .375% at the end of three and six months
if the loan has not been repaid. The loan is prepayable at any time without
penalty. On December 9, 2005, $73,184,000 of this loan was repaid to the
Company.

On January 9, 2006, Toys announced plans and is in the
process of closing 87 Toys “R” Us stores in the United States, of which twelve
stores will be converted into Babies “R” Us stores, five leased properties are
expiring and one has been sold. Vornado is handling the leasing and disposition
of the real estate of the remaining 69 stores. As a result of the store-closing
program, Toys will incur restructuring and other charges aggregating
approximately $155,000,000 before tax, which includes $45,000,000 for the cost
of liquidating the inventory. Of this amount, approximately $99,000,000 will be
recorded in Toys’ fourth quarter ending January 28, 2006 and $56,000,000 will
be recorded in the first quarter of their next fiscal year. These estimated
amounts are preliminary and remain subject to change. The Company’s 32.95%
share of the $155,000,000 charge is $51,000,000, of which $36,000,000 will have
no income statement effect as a result of purchase price accounting and the
remaining portion relating to the cost of liquidating the inventory of
approximately $9,000,000 after-tax, will be recorded as an expense in the first
quarter of 2006.

The unaudited pro forma information set forth below
presents the condensed consolidated statements of income for the Company for
the three months and years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (including Toys’
results for the three and twelve months ended October 29, 2005 and October 30,
2004, respectively) as if the above transactions had occurred on
November 1, 2003.

The unaudited pro forma
information below is not necessarily indicative of what the Company’s actual
results would have been had the Toys transactions been consummated on November
1, 2003, nor does it represent the results of operations for any future
periods. In management’s opinion, all adjustments necessary to reflect these
transactions have been made.

Investment in Sears,
Roebuck and Co. (“Sears”)

In July and August 2004, the
Company acquired an aggregate of 1,176,600 common shares of Sears, Roebuck and
Co. (“Sears”) for $41,945,000, an average price of $35.65 per share.

On
March 30, 2005, upon consummation of the merger between Sears and Kmart, the
Company received 370,330 common shares of Sears Holdings Corporation (Nasdaq: SHLD)
(“Sears Holdings”) and $21,797,000 of cash in exchange for its 1,176,600 Sears
common shares. The Sears Holdings common shares were valued at $48,143,000,
based on the March 30, 2005 closing share price of $130.00. As a result the
Company recognized a net gain of $27,651,000, the difference between the
aggregate cost basis in the Sears shares and the market value of the total
consideration received of $69,940,000. On April 4, 2005, 99,393 of the
Company’s Sears Holdings common shares with a value of $13,975,000 were utilized
to satisfy a third-party participation. The remaining 270,937 Sears Holdings
shares were sold in the fourth quarter of 2005 at a weighted average sales
price of $125.83 per share, which resulted in a net loss on disposition of
$1,137,000, based on the March 30, 2005 adjusted cost basis of $130.00 per
share. The Company’s net gain on its investment in these Sears shares was
$26,514,000.

In August and September 2004, the Company acquired an
economic interest in an additional 7,916,900 Sears common shares through a
series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution
pursuant to which the Company purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a
put option at the same strike price on Sears common shares. These call and put
options had an initial weighted-average strike price of $39.82 per share, or an
aggregate of $315,250,000, expire in April 2006 and provide for net cash
settlement. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options
increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and is credited for
the dividends received on the shares. The options provide the Company with the
same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the underlying common shares
and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45
basis points. Because these options are derivatives and do not qualify for
hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the
mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period are
recognized as an increase or decrease in “interest and other investment income”
on the Company’s consolidated statement of income.

On March 30, 2005, as a result of the merger between
Sears and Kmart and pursuant to the terms of the contract, the Company’s
derivative position representing 7,916,900 Sears common shares became a
derivative position representing 2,491,819 common shares of Sears Holdings
valued at $323,936,000 based on the then closing share price of $130.00 and
$146,663,000 of cash. As a result, the Company recognized a net gain of
$58,443,000 based on the fair value of the derivative position on March 30,
2005. During the fourth quarter of 2005, 402,660 of the common shares were sold
at a weighted average sales price of $123.77 per share. In accordance with the
derivative agreements, the proceeds from these sales will remain in the
derivative position until the entire position is settled or until expiration in
April 2006. Based on Sears Holdings’ closing share price on December 31, 2005
of $115.53, the remaining shares in the derivative position have a market value
of $241,361,000, which together with cash of $196,499,000 aggregates
$437,860,000. In the period from March 31, 2005 through December 31, 2005, the
Company recorded an expense of $43,475,000 from the derivative position, which
consists of (i) $30,230,000 from the mark-to-market of the remaining shares in
the derivative based on Sears Holdings $115.53 closing share price on December
31, 2005, (ii) $2,509,000 for the net loss on the shares sold based on a
weighted average sales price of $123.77 and (iii) $10,736,000 resulting
primarily from the increase in the strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus
45 basis points.

The Company’s aggregate net income recognized on the
owned shares and the derivative position from inception to December 31, 2005
was $124,266,000.

Investment
in Sears Canada Inc. (“Sears Canada”)

In connection with the Company’s investment in Sears
Holdings Corporation, the Company acquired 7,500,000 common shares of Sears
Canada between February and September of 2005 for an aggregate cost of
$143,737,000, or $19.16 per share. On December 16, 2005, Sears Canada paid a
special dividend, of which Vornado’s share was $120,500,000. As a result, the
Company recognized $22,885,000 of income in the fourth quarter of 2005 (in
addition to the unrecognized gain of $53,870,000 discussed below) and paid a
$.77 special cash dividend on December 30, 2005 to shareholders of record on
December 27, 2005. The Company accounts for its investment in Sears Canada as a
marketable equity security classified as available-for-sale. Accordingly, the
common shares are marked-to-market on a quarterly basis through “Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income” on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2005, based
on a closing share price of $15.47, the unrecognized gain in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income is $53,870,000.

Investment in

McDonald’s Corporation (“McDonalds”) (NYSE: MCD)

In July 2005, the Company acquired an aggregate of
858,000 common shares of McDonalds for $25,346,000, an average price of $29.54
per share. These shares are recorded as marketable equity securities on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet and are classified as “available for sale.”
Appreciation or depreciation in the fair market value of these shares is
recorded as an increase or decrease in “accumulated other comprehensive income”
in the shareholders’ equity section of the Company’s consolidated balance sheet
and not recognized in income. At December 31, 2005, based on McDonalds’ closing
stock price of $33.72 per share, $3,585,000 of appreciation in the value of
these shares was included in “accumulated other comprehensive income.”

During the three months ended September 30, 2005, the
Company acquired an economic interest in an additional 14,565,000 McDonalds
common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a
financial institution pursuant to which the Company purchased a call option and
simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on McDonalds’ common
shares. These call and put options have an initial weighted-average strike
price of $32.66 per share, or an aggregate of $475,692,000, expire on various
dates between July 30, 2007 and September 10, 2007 and provide for net cash
settlement. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options
increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points (up to 95 basis
points under certain circumstances) and is credited for the dividends received
on the shares. The options provide the Company with the same economic gain or
loss as if it had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the
aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because
these options are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the options
at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease
in “interest and other investment income” on the Company’s consolidated
statement of income. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company
recorded net income of $17,254,000, comprised of (i) $15,239,000 from the
mark-to-market of the options on December 31, 2005, based on McDonalds’ closing
stock price of $33.72 per share, (ii) $9,759,000 of dividend income, partially
offset by (iii) $7,744,000 for the increase in strike price resulting from the
LIBOR charge.

Based on McDonalds’ most recent filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company’s aggregate investment in
McDonalds represents 1.2% of McDonalds’ outstanding common shares.

Other 2005 Acquisitions

In addition to the acquisitions and investments
described above, the Company made $281,500,000 of other acquisitions and
investments during 2005, which are summarized below:

(1)

On May 31, 2005,
the Company contributed $50,000 in cash to Dune Capital L.P., a limited
partnership involved in corporate, real estate and asset-based investments. The
Company’s investment represented a 3.5% limited partnership interest for the
period from May 31, 2005 through September 30, 2005. On October 1, 2005, Dune
Capital made a return of capital to one of its investors and the Company’s
ownership interest was effectively increased to 5.4%. The Company initially
accounted for this investment on the cost method based on its ownership
interest on May 31, 2005. Subsequent to October 1, 2005, the Company accounts
for its investment on the equity method on a one-quarter lag basis. Dune
Capital’s financial statements are prepared on a market value basis and changes
in value from one reporting period to the next are recognized in income. Accordingly,
the Company’s share of Dune Capital’s net income or loss will reflect such
changes in market value.

Dispositions

On April 21, 2005, the Company, through its 85% owned
joint venture, sold 400 North LaSalle, a 452-unit high-rise residential tower

Temperature Controlled
Logistics

Prior to November 18, 2004, the Company owned a 60%
interest in Vornado Crescent Portland Partnership (“VCPP”) which owned
Americold Realty Trust (“Americold”). Americold owned 88 temperature controlled
warehouses, all of which were leased to AmeriCold Logistics. On November 4,
2004, Americold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for $47,700,000 in
cash. On November 18, 2004, the Company and its 40% partner, Crescent Real
Estate Equities Company (“CEI”) collectively sold 20.7% of Americold’s common
shares to The Yucaipa Companies (“Yucaipa”) for $145,000,000, which resulted in
a gain, of which the Company’s share was $18,789,000. The sale price was based
on a $1.450 billion valuation for Americold before debt and other obligations. Yucaipa
is a private equity firm with significant expertise in the food distribution,
logistics and retail industries. Upon closing of the sale to Yucaipa on
November 18, 2004, Americold is owned 47.6% by the Company, 31.7% by CEI and
20.7% by Yucaipa.

Pursuant to the
sales agreement: (i) Yucaipa may be entitled to receive up to 20% of the
increase in the value of Americold, realized through the sale of a portion of
the Company’s and CEI’s interests in Americold subject to limitations, provided
that Americold’s Threshold EBITDA, as defined, exceeds $133,500,000 at December
31, 2007; (ii) the annual asset management fee payable by CEI to the Company
has been reduced from approximately $5,500,000 to $4,548,000, payable quarterly
through October 30, 2027. CEI, at its option, may terminate the payment of this
fee at any time after November 2009, by paying the Company a termination fee
equal to the present value of the remaining payments through October 30, 2027,
discounted at 10%. In addition, CEI is obligated to pay a pro rata portion of
the termination fee to the extent it sells a portion of its equity interest in
Americold; and (iii) VCPP was dissolved. The Company has the right to appoint
three of the five members to Americold’s Board of Trustees. Consequently, the
Company is deemed to exercise control over Americold and, on November 18, 2004,
the Company began to consolidate the operations and financial position of
Americold into its accounts and no longer accounts for its investment on the
equity method.

Newkirk Master Limited Partnership and affiliates
(“Newkirk MLP”)

On August 11, 2005 Newkirk MLP completed a
$750,000,000 mortgage financing comprised of two separate loans. One loan, in
the initial principal amount of $272,200,000 (the “T-2 loan”) is collateralized
by contract right notes encumbering certain of Newkirk MLP’s properties. The
other loan, in the initial principal amount of $477,800,000 is collateralized
by Newkirk MLP’s properties, subject to the existing first and certain second
mortgage loans on those properties. The new loans bear interest at LIBOR plus
1.75% (5.87% as of December 31, 2005) and mature in August 2008, with two
one-year extension options. The loans are prepayable without penalty after
August 2006. The proceeds of the new loans were used to repay approximately
$708,737,000 of existing debt and accrued interest and $34,500,000 of
prepayment penalties and closing costs. The Company’s $7,992,000 share of the
losses on the early extinguishment of debt and write-off of the related
deferred financing costs are included in the equity in net loss of Newkirk MLP
in the year ended December 31, 2005.

On November 2, 2005, Newkirk Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE:
NKT) (“Newkirk REIT”) completed an initial public offering and in conjunction
therewith acquired a controlling interest in Newkirk MLP and became its sole
general partner. Prior to the public offering, the Company owned a 22.4%
interest in Newkirk MLP. Subsequent to the offering, the Company owns
approximately 15.8% of Newkirk MLP. The Company’s 10,186,991 partnership units
in Newkirk MLP are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common shares of
Newkirk REIT after an IPO blackout period that expires on November 7, 2006.

Upon completion of the initial public offering on
November 2, 2005, Newkirk MLP acquired the contract right notes and assumed the
obligations under the T-2 loan, which resulted in a net gain of $16,053,000 to
the Company. In addition, on November 7, 2005, the Company transferred Newkirk
MLP units to its partner to satisfy a promoted obligation, which resulted in an
expense of $8,470,000 representing the book value of the units transferred.

Investment
in GMH Communities L.P.

On July 20, 2004, the Company committed to make up to
a $159,000,000 convertible preferred investment in GMH Communities L.P.
(“GMH”), a partnership focused on the student and military housing sectors. Distributions
accrued on the full committed balance of the investment, whether or not drawn,
from July 20, 2004, at a rate of 16.27%. In connection with this commitment,
the Company received a placement fee of $3,200,000. The Company also purchased
for $1,000,000, warrants to acquire GMH common equity. The warrants entitled
the Company to acquire (i) 6,666,667 limited partnership units in GMH at an
exercise price of $7.50 per unit and (ii) 5,496,724 limited partnership units
at an exercise price of $9.10 per unit, through May 6, 2006 and are adjusted
for dividends declared by GCT. The Company funded a total of $113,777,000 of
the commitment as of November 3, 2004.

On November 3, 2004, GMH Communities Trust (NYSE: GCT)
(“GCT”) closed its initial public offering (“IPO”) at a price of $12.00 per
share. GCT is a real estate investment trust that conducts its business through
GMH, of which it is the sole general partner. In connection with the IPO, (i)
the $113,777,000 previously funded by the Company under the $159,000,000
commitment was repaid, together with accrued distributions of $13,381,000, (ii)
the Company contributed its 90% interest in Campus Club Gainesville, which
it acquired in 2000, in exchange for an additional 671,190 GMH limited
partnership units and (iii) the Company exercised its first tranche of warrants
to acquire 6,666,667 limited partnership units at a price of $7.50 per unit, or
an aggregate of $50,000,000, which resulted in a gain of $29,500,000.

As of

December 31,

, the Company owns 7,337,857 GMH partnership units (which are
exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common shares of GCT) and 700,000
common shares of GCT, which were acquired from GCT in October 2005 for
$14.25 per share, and holds warrants to purchase 5,884,727 GMH limited
partnership units or GCT common shares at a price of $8.50 per unit or
share. The Company’s aggregate investment represents 11.3% of the limited
partnership interest in GMH.

The Company accounts for its investment in the GMH
partnership units and GCT common shares on the equity-method based on its
percentage ownership interest and because Michael D. Fascitelli, the Company’s
President, is a member of the Board of Trustees of GCT, effective August 10,
2005. The Company records its pro-rata share of GMH’s net income or loss on a
one-quarter lag basis as the Company files its financial statements on Form
10-K and 10-Q prior to the time GMH files its financial statements.

The Company accounts for the warrants as derivative
instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly,
the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the warrants at the
end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in
“interest and other investment income” on the Company’s consolidated statements
of income. In the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company
recognized income of $14,079,000 and $24,190,000, respectively, from the
mark-to-market of these warrants which were valued using a trinomial option
pricing model based on GCT’s closing stock price on the NYSE of $15.51 and
$14.10 per share on December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

For Mr. Fascitelli’s service as a Director, on August
10, 2005 he received 4,034 restricted common shares of GCT at a price of $14.33
per share. These shares vest in equal installments over three years and are
held by Mr. Fascitelli for the Company’s benefit.

U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) Space

The following table sets forth the Company’s original
plan to re-lease the PTO space and the space leased through February 1, 2006.

(1)    Crystal Plaza Two, a 13-story office
building, was taken out of service to be converted to a 19-story residential
tower containing 265 rentable/saleable square feet and 256 apartments.  The original plan assumed that this building
would remain an office building to be re-leased in Q1 06.

Of the square feet leased to larger tenants, 261,000
square feet was leased to the Federal Supply Service (which will relocate from
240,000 square feet in other Crystal City buildings); 144,000 square feet was
leased to KBR, a defense contractor; and 126,000 square feet was leased to the
Public Broadcasting Service. 
Straight-line rent per square foot for the square feet leased is $33.50,
which is equal to the estimate in the original plan.  Tenant improvements and leasing commissions
per square foot are $43.50 as compared to the original plan of $45.28.


Critical
Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements management
has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the
accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of
the consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in
conjunction with the more complete discussion of the Company’s accounting
policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Real Estate

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation and amortization. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the
carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $9.8
billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are charged to
operations as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the
useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the
costs associated with a property to its various components. If the Company does
not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful
lives of its real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated.

Upon acquisitions of real estate, the Company assesses
the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements,
identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and
acquired in-place leases and customer relationships) and acquired liabilities
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 141: Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142: Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, and allocates purchase price based on these assessments. The
Company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that
utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market
information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors
including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic
conditions that may affect the property. The Company’s properties, including
any related intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment if events or
circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not
be recoverable. If the Company incorrectly estimates the values at acquisition
or the undiscounted cash flows, initial allocations of purchase price and
future impairment charges may be different. The impact of the Company’s
estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could
be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Identified Intangible Assets

Upon an acquisition of a business
the Company records intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value
separate and apart from goodwill. The Company amortizes identified intangible
assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period
over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the
future cash flows of the business acquired. Intangible assets subject to
amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. An
impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset,
including the related real estate when appropriate, is not recoverable and its
carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets were $197,014,000 and
$176,122,000, respectively. Such amounts are included in “other assets” on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company had
$146,325,000 and $70,264,000, of identified intangible liabilities as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, which are included in “deferred credit” on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets. If these assets are deemed to be
impaired, or the estimated useful lives of finite-life intangibles assets or
liabilities change, the impact to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements could be material.


Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable

The Company’s policy is to record mortgages and notes
receivable at the stated principal amount net of any discount or premium. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying amounts of Notes and Mortgage Loans
Receivable were $363,565,000 and $440,186,000, respectively. The Company
accretes or amortizes any discounts or premiums over the life of the related
loan receivable utilizing the effective interest method. The Company evaluates
the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of its loans, if
circumstances warrant, to determine whether it is impaired. A loan is
considered to be impaired, when based on current information and events, it is
probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according
to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired,
the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the recorded
investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash
flows at the loan’s effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, to
the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The impact of
the Company’s estimates in connection with the collectibility of both interest
and principal of its loans could be material to the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

Partially-Owned Entities

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying amounts
of investments and advances to partially-owned entities, including Alexander’s
and Toys “R” Us, were $1,369,853,000 and $605,300,000, respectively. In
determining whether the Company has a controlling interest in a partially-owned
entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, it
considers factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management
representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive
participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a
variable interest entity in which it will absorb the majority of the entity’s
expected losses, if they occur, or receive the majority of the expected
residual returns, if they occur, or both. The Company accounts for investments
on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and
the Company has significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity
method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for
the Company’s share of net income or loss and cash contributions and
distributions. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity
method accounting are accounted for on the cost method.

The Company’s investments in partially-owned entities
are reviewed for impairment, periodically, if events or circumstances change
indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The
ultimate realization of the Company’s investments in partially-owned entities
is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each
investment and market conditions. The Company will record an impairment charge
if it determines that a decline in the value of an investment is other than
temporary.

Allowance For Doubtful Accounts

The Company periodically evaluates the collectibility
of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts
($16,907,000 and $17,339,000 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004) for estimated
losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under
their lease agreements. The Company also maintains an allowance for receivables
arising from the straight-lining of rents ($6,051,000 and $6,787,000 as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004). This receivable arises from earnings recognized in
excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management
exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment
history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These
estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.


Revenue Recognition

The Company has the following revenue sources and
revenue recognition policies:

•

Base
Rents — income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the
non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which
includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.

•

Percentage
Rents — income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the
sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold. These rents are recognized
in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104: Revenue Recognition,
which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency
has been removed (i.e., sales thresholds have been achieved).

•

Hotel
Revenues — income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which
consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income
is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue
are recognized when the services have been rendered.

•

Trade
Show Revenues — income arising from the operation of trade shows, including
rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized in accordance with the booth
rental contracts when the trade shows have occurred.

•

Expense
Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the
recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of
the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the
expenses are incurred.

•

Temperature
Controlled Logistics revenue — income arising from the Company’s investment in
Americold Logistics. Storage and handling revenue are recognized as services
are provided. Transportation fees are recognized upon delivery to customers.

•

Management,
Leasing and Other Fees — income arising from contractual agreements with third
parties or with partially-owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the
related services are performed under the respective agreements.

Before
the Company recognizes revenue, it assesses, among other things, its
collectibility. If the Company’s assessment of the collectibility of its
revenue changes, the impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements
could be material.

Income

Taxes

The Company operates in a manner intended to enable it
to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) under
Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those
sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a
dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions
will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to
its shareholders. The Company intends to distribute to its shareholders 100% of
its taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is
required. If the Company fails to distribute the required amount of income to
its shareholders, or fails to meet other REIT requirements, it may fail to
qualify as a REIT and substantial adverse tax consequences may result.


Recently Issued Accounting Literature

On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets - An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.

The amendments made by SFAS No. 153 are based on the principle that exchanges
of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets
exchanged. Further, the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for
nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a
broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have
“commercial substance.” SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset
exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The
adoption of SFAS No. 153 on its effective date did not have a material effect
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123:
(Revised 2004) -

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123R”). SFAS No. 123R replaces SFAS No. 123, which the Company
adopted on January 1, 2003. SFAS No. 123R requires that the compensation cost
relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial
statements and measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability
instruments issued. SFAS No. 123R is effective as of the first annual reporting
period beginning after December 31, 2005. The Company has adopted SFAS No. 123R
on a modified prospective method, effective January 1, 2006 and believes that
the adoption will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial
statements.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations

, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143,

Asset Retirement Obligations

. FIN 47
provides clarification of the term “conditional asset retirement obligation” as
used in SFAS 143, defined as a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement
activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a
future event that may or may not be within the control of the company. Under
this standard, a company must record a liability for a conditional asset
retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably
estimated. FIN 47 became effective in the Company’s fiscal quarter ended
December 31, 2005. Certain of the Company’s real estate assets contain
asbestos. Although the asbestos is appropriately contained, in accordance with
current environmental regulations, the Company’s practice is to remediate the
asbestos upon the renovation or redevelopment of its properties. Accordingly,
the Company has determined that these assets meet the criteria for recording a
liability and has recorded an asset retirement obligation aggregating
approximately $8,400,000, which is included in “Other Liabilities” on the
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005. The cumulative effect of
adopting this standard was approximately $2,500,000, and is included in
“Depreciation and Amortization” on the consolidated statement of income for the
year ended December 31, 2005.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections – A Replacement
of APB Opinion No. 20 and SFAS No. 3.

SFAS No. 154 changes the
requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting
principle by requiring that a voluntary change in accounting principle be
applied retrospectively with all prior periods’ financial statements presented
on the new accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so. SFAS No.
154 also requires that a change in depreciation or amortization for long-lived,
non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate
effected by a change in accounting principle and corrections of errors in
previously issued financial statements should be termed a “restatement”. SFAS
No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company believes that the
adoption of SFAS No. 154 will not have a material effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached
by the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) on Issue No. 04-05, “Determining
Whether a General Partner, or General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited
Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights”
(“EITF 04-05”). EITF 04-05 provides a framework for determining whether a
general partner controls, and should consolidate, a limited partnership or a
similar entity. EITF 04-05 became effective on June 29, 2005, for all newly
formed or modified limited partnership arrangements and January 1, 2006 for all
existing limited partnership arrangements. The Company believes that the
adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on its consolidated
financial statements.


Net
income and EBITDA by Segment for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003.

EBITDA represents “Earnings Before
Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.” Management considers EBITDA a
supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the un-levered
performance of its segments as it relates to the total return on assets as
opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold
based on a multiple of EBITDA, management utilizes this measure to make
investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to
that of its peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income.
EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other
companies.

Other EBITDA includes a net gain on sale of real
estate of $31,614, income from the mark-to-market and conversion of derivative
instruments of $72,816 and certain other gains and losses that affect
comparability. Excluding these items the percentages of EBITDA by segment are
54.9% for Office, 18.2% for Retail, 12.9% for Merchandise Mart, 6.6% for
Temperature Controlled Logistics, 1.3% for Toys and 6.2% for Other.

See Notes on
page 77.


Included in EBITDA are (i) net gains on sale of real
estate of $75,755, of which and $9,850 and $65,905 are in the Retail and Other
segments, respectively, and (ii) net gains from the mark-to-market and
conversion of derivative instruments of $135,372 and certain other gains and
losses that affect comparability which are in the Other segment. Excluding
these items, the percentages of EBITDA by segment are 62.4% for Office, 16.9%
for Retail, 13.3% for Merchandise Mart, 7.0% for Temperature Controlled
Logistics and 0.4% for Other.

See
Notes on page 77.


Included in EBITDA are gains on sale of real estate of
$161,789, of which $157,200 and $4,589 are in the Office and Retail segments,
respectively. Excluding these items, the percentages of EBITDA by segment are
69.8% for Office, 16.3% for Retail, 14.5% for Merchandise Mart, 8.9% for
Temperature Controlled Logistics and (9.5)% for Other.

See
Notes on the following page.


Notes to the preceding tabular information:

(1)

Interest and
debt expense and depreciation and amortization included in the reconciliation
of net income to EBITDA includes the Company’s share of the interest and debt
expense and depreciation and amortization of its partially-owned entities.

At December
31, 2004, 7 West 34

th

Street, a 440,000 square foot New York office
building, was 100% occupied by four tenants, of which Health Insurance Plan of
New York (“HIP”) and Fairchild Publications occupied 255,000 and 146,000 square
feet, respectively. Effective January 4, 2005, the Company entered into a lease
termination agreement with HIP under which HIP made an initial payment of
$13,362 and is anticipated to make annual payments ranging from $1,000 to
$2,000 over the remaining six years of the HIP lease contingent upon the level
of operating expenses of the building in each year. In connection with the
termination of the HIP lease, the Company wrote off the $2,462 balance of the
HIP receivable arising from the straight-lining of rent. In the first quarter
of 2005, the Company began redevelopment of a portion of this property into a
permanent showroom building for the giftware industry. As of January 1, 2005,
the Company transferred the operations and financial results related to the
office component of this asset from the New York City Office division to the
Merchandise Mart division for both the current and prior periods presented. The
operations and financial results related to the retail component of this asset
were transferred to the Retail division for both current and prior periods
presented.

(3)

Operating
results for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 reflect the
consolidation of the Company’s investment in Americold Realty Trust beginning
on November 18, 2004. Previously, this investment was accounted for on the
equity method.

Income Applicable to Alexander’s

Income applicable to Alexander’s (loan interest
income, management, leasing, development and commitment fees, and equity in
income) was $59,022,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to
$8,580,000 for the prior year, an increase of $50,442,000.  The increase is primarily due to (i) $30,895,000
for the Company’s share of Alexander’s after-tax net gain on sale of
condominiums in the current year, (ii) a $16,236,000 decrease in the
Company’s share of Alexander’s stock appreciation rights compensation (“SAR”)
expense, (iii) income from Alexander’s 731 Lexington Avenue property which
was placed into service subsequent to the third quarter of 2004, (iv) a

increase in management and leasing fees, partially offset by, (vi) a
$2,520,000 decrease in interest income on the Company’s loans to Alexander’s
which were repaid in July 2005 and (vii) $1,274,000 for the Company’s
share of a gain on sale of land parcel in the prior year.

Loss Applicable to Toys ‘R’ Us

The business of Toys is highly seasonal.  Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income
accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income.  Because Toys’ fiscal year ends on the
Saturday nearest January 31, the Company records its 32.95% share of Toys
net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis. 
Accordingly, the Company will record its share of Toys’ fourth quarter
net income in its first quarter of 2006. 
Equity in net loss from Toys for the period from July 21, 2005
(date of acquisition) through December 31, 2005 was $40,496,000 which
consisted of (i) the Company’s $1,977,000 share of Toys net loss in Toys’
second quarter ended July 30, 2005 for the period from July 21, 2005
(date of acquisition) through July 30, 2005, (ii) the Company’s
$44,812,000 share of Toys net loss in Toys’ third quarter ended October 29,
2005, partially offset by, (iii) $5,043,000 of interest income on the
Company’s senior unsecured bridge loan and (iv) $1,250,000 of management
fees.


Income from Partially-Owned Entities

Below are the condensed statements of operations of
the Company’s unconsolidated investments, as well as the increase (decrease) in
income from these partially-owned entities for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004:

See footnotes on following page.


Notes
to preceding tabular information:

(1)

See page 66 for details.

(2)

See page 57 for details.

(3)

On August 8, 2005, the Company
acquired the remaining 20% of Starwood Ceruzzi it did not already own for $940
in cash.

(4)

On November 18, 2004, the Company’s
investment in Americold was consolidated into the accounts of the Company.  See page 65 for details.

(5)

On August 11, 2005, the Company’s
$23,500 preferred equity investment in the Monmouth Mall with a yield of 14%
was replaced with $10,000 of new preferred equity with a yield of 9.5%.  In connection with this transaction the
venture paid to the Company a prepayment penalty of $4,346, of which $2,173 was
recognized as income from partially-owned entities in 2005.

(6)

Included in the Company’s share of net
income from Newkirk MLP are the following:

In
addition, the Company has excluded its $7,119 share of the gain recognized by
Newkirk MLP on the sale of its Stater Brothers real estate portfolio to the
Company on July 29, 2004, which was reflected as an adjustment to the
basis of the Company’s investment in Newkirk MLP.

(7)

2004 includes the Company’s $3,833 share
of Starwood Ceruzzi’s impairment loss.

(8)

2005 includes $1,351 of income recognized
from Dune Capital L.P.


Interest and Other Investment Income

Interest and other investment income (interest income
on mortgage loans receivable, other interest income and dividend income) was
$167,225,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $203,998,000
in the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of $36,773,000.  This decrease resulted from the following:

Interest and Debt Expense

Interest and debt expense was $340,751,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $242,955,000 in the year ended December 31,
2004, an increase of $97,796,000.  This
increase is primarily due to (i) $49,893,000 resulting from the
consolidation of the Company’s investment in Americold from November 18,
2004 versus accounting for the investment on the equity method previously, (ii) $26,199,000
from a 2.27% increase in the weighted average interest rate on variable rate
debt, (iii) $15,335,000 of interest expense on the $500,000,000
exchangeable senior debentures issued in March 2005 and (iv) $6,881,000
of additional interest expense on the $250,000,000 senior unsecured notes due
2009, which were issued in August 2004.

Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly-owned and
Partially-owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate

Net gain on disposition of wholly-owned and
partially-owned assets other than depreciable real estate of $39,042,000 for
the year ended December 31, 2005 is comprised of (i) $25,346,000 of
net gains on sales of marketable equity securities, of which $9,017,000 relates
to the disposition of the Prime Group common shares, (ii) $12,110,000 for
the net gain on disposition of the Company’s senior preferred equity investment
in 3700 Las Vegas Boulevard and (iii) $1,586,000 relates to net gains on
sale of land parcels.  Net gain on
disposition of wholly-owned and partially-owned assets other than depreciable
real estate of $19,775,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily
represents a $18,789,000 net gain on sale of a portion of the investment in
Americold to Yucaipa.

Minority Interest of Partially-Owned Entities

Minority interest expense of partially-owned entities
was $3,808,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $109,000
in the prior year, an increase of $3,699,000. 
This increase resulted primarily from the consolidation of the Company’s
investment in Americold beginning on November 18, 2004 versus accounting
for the investment on the equity method in the prior year.


Discontinued Operations

Assets related to discontinued operations consist
primarily of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation.  The following table sets forth the balances
of the assets related to discontinued operations as of December 31, 2005
and 2004.

Liabilities related to discontinued operations as of December 31,
2004 represents the 400 North LaSalle mortgage payable of $5,187,000.

The combined results of operations of the assets
related to discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2005
and 2004 are as follows:

On April 21, 2005, the Company, through its 85%
joint venture, sold 400 North LaSalle, a 452-unit high-rise residential tower
in Chicago, Illinois, for $126,000,000, which resulted in a net gain on sale
after closing costs of $31,614,000.  All
of the proceeds from the sale were reinvested in tax-free “like-kind” exchange
investments pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code.

In anticipation of selling the Palisades Residential
Complex, on February 27, 2004, the Company acquired the remaining 25%
interest in the Palisades venture it did not previously own for approximately
$17,000,000 in cash.  On June 29,
2004, the Company sold the Palisades for $222,500,000, which resulted in a net
gain on sale after closing costs of $65,905,000.

On August 12, 2004, the Company sold its Dundalk,
Maryland shopping center for $12,900,000, which resulted in a net gain on sale
after closing costs of $9,850,000.

Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions of the
Operating Partnership

Perpetual preferred unit distributions of the
Operating Partnership were $67,119,000 for the year ended December 31,
2005, compared to $69,108,000 for the prior year, a decrease of
$1,989,000.  This decrease resulted
primarily from the redemption of (i) $80,000,000 of the 8.25% Series D-3
preferred units in January 2005, (ii) $245,000,000 of the remaining
8.25% Series D-3 and D-4 preferred units in July 2005, (iii) $342,000,000
of the 8.25% Series D-5 and D-7 preferred units in September 2005 and
(iv) $30,000,000 of the 8.25% Series D-6 and D-8 preferred units in December 2005,
partially offset by, (v) a $19,017,000 write-off of the issuance costs of
the preferred units redeemed in 2005, and (vi) distributions to holders of
the 7.20% Series D-11 and 6.55% Series D-12 units issued in May and
December 2004.

Minority Limited Partners’ Interest in the Operating
Partnership

Minority limited partners’ interest in the Operating
Partnership was $66,755,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared
to $88,091,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $21,336,000.  This decrease results primarily from a lower
minority limited partnership ownership interest due to the conversion of Class A
operating partnership units into common shares of the Company during 2004 and
2005, and lower net income subject to allocation to the minority limited
partners.


EBITDA

Below are the details of the changes by segment in
EBITDA.

(1)

Represents
operations which were owned for the same period in each year and excludes
non-recurring income and expenses which are included in “acquisitions,
dispositions and non-same store income and expenses” above.

(2)

EBITDA and
the same store percentage increase (decrease) were $341,601 and 4.3% for the
New York City Office portfolio and $290,777 and (4.7%) for the Washington, D.C.
Office portfolio.

(3)

EBITDA and
the same store percentage increase reflect the commencement of the WPP Group
leases (228 square feet) in the third quarter of 2004 and the Chicago Sun Times
lease (127 square feet) in the second quarter of 2004.  The same store percentage increase in EBITDA
exclusive of these leases was 0.9%.

(4)

Not
comparable because prior to November 4, 2004, (date the operations of
AmeriCold Logistics were combined with Americold Realty Trust), the Company
reflected its equity in the rent Americold received from AmeriCold
Logistics.  Subsequent thereto, the
Company consolidates the operations of the combined company.  See page 101 for condensed pro forma
operating results of Americold for the years ended December 31, 2005 and
2004, giving effect to the acquisition of its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, as
if it had occurred on January 1, 2004. 
The same store percentage increase on a pro forma basis for the combined
company is 14.2%.

(5)

The business
of Toys is highly seasonal. 
Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80%
of its fiscal year net income.  Because
Toys’ fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, the Company
records its 32.95% share of Toys net income or loss on a one-quarter lag
basis.  Accordingly, the Company will
record its share of Toys fourth quarter net income in its first quarter of
2006.  Toys EBITDA above includes (i) the

$15,574,000 net, in the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease after SAR
expense of $6,994,000.  This decrease
resulted primarily from (i) an increase in the Company’s share of

Interest and Other Investment Income

Interest and other investment income (interest income
on mortgage loans receivable, other interest income and dividend income) was
$203,998,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $25,401,000
in the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $178,597,000.  This increase results from:

year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $230,064,000 in the year ended December 31,
2003, an increase of $12,891,000.  This
increase is primarily due to (i) $6,379,000 resulting from the
consolidation of the Company’s investment in Americold from November 18,
2004 versus equity method accounting prior, (ii) $7,411,000 from an
increase in average outstanding debt balances, primarily due to the issuance of
$250,000,000 and $200,000,000 of senior unsecured notes in August 2004 and
November 2003, respectively, and (iii) $1,206,000 from an increase in

Minority Limited Partners’ Interest in the Operating
Partnership

Minority limited partners’ interest in the Operating
Partnership was $88,091,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared
to $105,132,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $17,041,000.  This decrease results primarily from a lower
minority limited partnership ownership interest due to the conversion of Class A
operating partnership units into common shares of the Company during 2003 and
2004, partially offset by higher net income subject to allocation to the
minority limited partners.

Below are the details of the changes by segment in EBITDA for the three
months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the three months ended December 31,
2004.


The Company’s revenues and expenses are subject to
seasonality during the year which impacts quarter-by-quarter net earnings, cash
flows and funds from operations. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically,
Toys’ fourth quarter net income, which the Company records on a one-quarter lag
basis in its first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of Toys’ fiscal year net
income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced
higher utility costs in the third quarter of the year. The Merchandise Mart
segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters
of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail
segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the
recognition of percentage rental income. The Temperature Controlled Logistics
segment has experienced higher earnings in the fourth quarter due to higher
activity and occupancy in its warehouse operations due to the holiday season’s
impact on the food industry.

Below are the details of the changes by segment in EBITDA for the
three months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2005:

EBITDA and same store percentage increase was $90,468 and 7.8% for the
New York City Office portfolio and $73,389 and 6.5% for the Washington,
D.C. Office portfolio. The same store percentage changes reflect seasonally
lower utility costs in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, of which
$4,584 relates to the New York City Office portfolio and $2,871 relates to the
Washington D.C. Office portfolio. The same store operations exclusive of the
seasonal change in utilities increased by 2.1% for the New York City Office
portfolio and increased by 2.3% for the Washington, D.C. Office portfolio.

Investment in Americold Realty Trust

Prior to November 18, 2004, the Company owned a
60% interest in Vornado Crescent Portland Partnership (“VCPP”) which owned
Americold Realty Trust (“Americold”). Americold owned 88 temperature controlled
warehouses, all of which were leased to AmeriCold Logistics. On November 4,
2004, Americold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for $47,700,000 in
cash. On November 18, 2004, the Company and its 40% partner, Crescent Real
Estate Equities Company (“CEI”) collectively sold 20.7% of Americold’s common
shares to The Yucaipa Companies (“Yucaipa”) for $145,000,000, which resulted in
a gain, of which the Company’s share was $18,789,000. The sale price was based
on a $1.450 billion valuation for Americold before debt and other obligations. Yucaipa
is a private equity firm with significant expertise in the food distribution,
logistics and retail industries. Upon closing of the sale to Yucaipa on November 18,
2004, Americold is owned 47.6% by the Company, 31.7% by CEI and 20.7% by
Yucaipa.

Pursuant to the sales agreement: (i) Yucaipa may be
entitled to receive up to 20% of the increase in the value of Americold,
realized through the sale of a portion of the Company’s and CEI’s interests in
Americold subject to limitations, provided that Americold’s Threshold EBITDA,
as defined, exceeds $133,500,000 at December 31, 2007; (ii) the
annual asset management fee payable by CEI to the Company has been reduced from
approximately $5,500,000 to $4,548,000, payable quarterly through October 30,
2027. CEI, at its option, may terminate the payment of this fee at any
time after November 2009, by paying the Company a termination fee equal to
the present value of the remaining payments through October 30, 2027,
discounted at 10%. In addition, CEI is obligated to pay a pro rata portion of
the termination fee to the extent it sells a portion of its equity interest in
Americold; and (iii) VCPP was dissolved. The Company has the right to
appoint three of the five members to Americold’s Board of Trustees. Consequently,
the Company is deemed to exercise control over Americold and, on November 18,
2004, the Company began to consolidate the operations and financial position of
Americold into its accounts and no longer accounts for its investment on the
equity method.

The following is a pro forma presentation of the results of operations
of Americold for the three months and year ended December 31, 2004, giving
effect to the acquisition of AmeriCold Logistics as if it had occurred on January 1,
2004 as compared to the actual results for the comparable periods in the
current year.

Related Party Transactions

Loan and Compensation Agreements

On December 22, 2005, Steven Roth, the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer, repaid to the Company his $13,122,500 outstanding loan
which was scheduled to mature in January 2006. Pursuant to a credit
agreement dated November 1999, Mr. Roth may draw up to
$15,000,000 of loans from the Company on a revolving basis. Each loan bears
interest, payable quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the
loan is made and matures on the sixth anniversary of such loan. Loans are
collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the amount
outstanding. On December 23, 2005, Mr. Roth borrowed $13,122,500
under this facility, which bears interest at 4.45% per annum and matures on December 23,
2011.

At December 31, 2005, the balance of the loan
due from Michael Fascitelli, the Company’s President, in accordance with his
employment agreement was $8,600,000. The loan matures in December 2006 and
bears interest, payable quarterly, at a weighted average rate of 3.97% (based
on the applicable Federal rate).

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company extended
its employment agreement with Mr. Fascitelli for a five-year period
through December 31, 2006. Pursuant to the extended employment agreement, Mr. Fascitelli
is entitled to receive a deferred payment on December 31, 2006 of 626,566
Vornado common shares which are valued for compensation purposes at $27,500,000
(the value of the shares on March 8, 2002, the date the extended
employment agreement was executed). The shares are held in a rabbi trust for
the benefit of Mr. Fascitelli and vested 100% on December 31, 2002. The
extended employment agreement does not permit diversification, allows
settlement of the deferred compensation obligation by delivery of these shares
only, and permits the deferred delivery of these shares. The value of these
shares was amortized ratably over the one-year vesting period as compensation
expense.

Pursuant to the Company’s annual compensation review
in February 2002 with Joseph Macnow, the Company’s Chief Financial
Officer, the Compensation Committee approved a $2,000,000 loan to Mr. Macnow,
bearing interest at the applicable federal rate of 4.65% per annum and due in June 2007.
The loan was funded on July 23, 2002 and is collateralized by assets with
a value of not less than two times the loan amount.

On February 22, 2005, the Company and Sandeep
Mathrani, Executive Vice President – Retail Division, entered into a new
employment agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company granted Mr. Mathrani
(i) 16,836 restricted shares of the Company’s stock, (ii) stock
options to acquire 300,000 of the Company’s common shares at an exercise price
of $71.275 per share and (iii) the right to receive 200,000 stock options
over the next two years at the then prevailing market price. In addition, Mr. Mathrani
repaid the $500,000 loan the Company provided him under his prior employment
agreement.

On March 11, 2004, the Company loaned
$2,000,000 to Melvyn Blum, an executive officer of the Company, pursuant to the
revolving credit facility contained in his January 2000 employment
agreement. Melvyn Blum resigned effective July 15, 2005. In accordance
with the terms of his employment agreement, his $2,000,000 outstanding loan as
of June 30, 2005 was repaid on August 14, 2005.

Transactions with Affiliates and
Officers and Trustees of the Company

Alexander’s

The Company owns 33% of Alexander’s. Mr. Roth
and Mr. Fascitelli are officers and directors of Alexander’s, the Company
provides various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management,
development and leasing agreements. These agreements are described in Note 5 -
Investments in Partially-Owned Entities to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.

On December 29, 2005, Michael Fascitelli, the
Company’s President and President of Alexander’s, exercised 350,000 of his
Alexander’s stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) which were scheduled to expire
in December 2006 and received $173.82 for each SAR exercised, representing
the difference between Alexander’s stock price of $247.70 (the average of the
high and low market price) on the date of exercise and the exercise price of
$73.88. This exercise was consistent with Alexander’s tax planning.

On January 10, 2006, the Omnibus Stock Plan
Committee of the Board of Directors of Alexander’s granted Mr. Fascitelli
a SAR covering 350,000 shares of Alexander’s common stock. The exercise price
of the SAR is $243.83 per share of common stock, which was the average of the
high and low trading price of Alexander’s common stock on date of grant. The
SAR will become exercisable on July 10, 2006, provided Mr. Fascitelli
is employed with Alexander’s on such date, and will expire on March 14,
2007. Mr. Fascitelli’s early exercise and Alexander’s related tax
consequences were factors in Alexander’s decision to make the new grant to him.


Interstate Properties

As of December 31, 2005, Interstate Properties
and its partners beneficially owned approximately 9.2% of the common shares of
beneficial interest of the Company and 27.7% of Alexander’s common stock. Interstate
Properties is a general partnership in which Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and
Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners. Mr. Roth is the Chairman
of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the managing general
partner of Interstate Properties, and the Chief Executive Officer and a
director of Alexander’s. Messrs. Mandelbaum and Wight are trustees of the
Company and also directors of Alexander’s.

The Company manages and leases the real estate assets
of Interstate Properties pursuant to a management agreement for which the
Company receives an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage
rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically
renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days’ notice at
the end of the term. The Company believes based upon comparable fees charged by
other real estate companies that its terms are fair to the Company. The Company
earned $791,000, $726,000 and $703,000 of management fees under the management
agreement for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. In
addition, during fiscal year 2003, as a result of a previously existing leasing
arrangement with Alexander’s, Alexander’s paid to Interstate $587,000, for the
leasing and other services actually rendered by the Company. Upon receipt of
these payments, Interstate promptly paid them over to the Company without
retaining any interest therein. This arrangement was terminated at the end of
2003 and all payments by Alexander’s thereafter for these leasing and other
services are made directly to the Company.

Vornado Operating Company (“Vornado Operating”)

In October 1998, Vornado Operating was spun off
from the Company in order to own assets that the Company could not itself own
and conduct activities that the Company could not itself conduct. Vornado
Operating’s primary asset was its 60% investment in AmeriCold Logistics, which
leased 88 refrigerated warehouses from Americold, owned 60% by the Company. On November 4,
2004, Americold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for $47,700,000 in
cash. As part of this transaction, Vornado Operating repaid the
$21,989,000 balance of its loan to the Company as well as $4,771,000 of unpaid
interest. Because the Company fully reserved for the interest income on this
loan beginning in January 2002, it recognized $4,771,000 of income upon
collection in the fourth quarter 2004.

In November 2004, a class action
shareholder derivative lawsuit was brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery
against Vornado Operating, its directors and the Company. The lawsuit sought to
enjoin the dissolution of Vornado Operating, rescind the previously completed
sale of AmeriCold Logistics (owned 60% by Vornado Operating) to Americold
(owned 60% by the Company) and damages. In addition, the plaintiffs claimed
that the Vornado Operating directors breached their fiduciary duties. On November 24,
2004, a stipulation of settlement was entered into under which the Company
agreed to settle the lawsuit with a payment of approximately $4,500,000 or
about $1 per Vornado Operating share or partnership unit before litigation
expenses. The Company accrued the proposed settlement payment and related legal
costs as part of “general and administrative expense” in the fourth
quarter of 2004. On March 22, 2005, the Court approved the settlement.


Other

On January 1, 2003, the Company acquired BMS, a
company which provides cleaning and related services principally to the Company’s
Manhattan office properties, for $13,000,000 in cash from the estate of
Bernard Mendik and certain other individuals including David R. Greenbaum,
an executive officer of the Company. The Company paid BMS $53,024,000, for the
year ended December 31, 2002, for services rendered to the Company’s
Manhattan office properties. Although the terms and conditions of the contracts
pursuant to which these services were provided were not negotiated at arms
length, the Company believes based upon comparable amounts charged to other
real estate companies that the terms and conditions of the contracts were fair
to the Company.

On August 4, 2003, the Company completed the
acquisition of 2101 L Street, a 370,000 square foot office building located in
Washington D.C. The consideration for the acquisition consisted of
approximately 1.1 million newly issued Operating Partnership units (valued at
approximately $49,517,000) and the assumption of existing mortgage debt and
transaction costs totaling approximately $32,000,000. Robert H. Smith and
Robert P. Kogod, trustees of Vornado, together with family members, owned
approximately 24 percent of the limited partnership that sold the building and Mr. Smith
was a general partner. On August 5, 2003, the Company repaid the mortgage
of $29,056,000.

On October 7, 2003, the Company acquired a 2.5%
interest in the planned redevelopment of Waterfront (described in Note 3) for
$2,171,000, of which the Company paid $1,545,000 in cash and issued 12,500
Operating Partnership units valued at $626,000. The partnership units were
issued to Mitchell N. Schear, one of the partners in the Waterfront
interest, and the President of the Company’s CESCR division.

On July 1, 2004, the Company acquired the Marriott hotel located
in its Crystal City office complex from a limited partnership in which Robert
H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod, trustees of the Company, together with family
members, own approximately 67 percent. The purchase price of $21,500,000 was
paid in cash. The hotel contains 343 rooms and is leased to an affiliate of
Marriott International, Inc. until July 31, 2015, with one 10-year
extension option. The land under the hotel was acquired in 1999.

On October 1, 2004, the Company increased its
ownership interest in the Investment Building in Washington, D.C. to 5% by
acquiring an additional 2.8% interest for $2,240,000 in cash. The Company’s
original interest in the property was acquired in connection with the
acquisition of the Kaempfer Company in April 2003. Mitchell N. Schear,
President of the Company’s Washington, D.C. Office division and other former
members of Kaempfer management were also partners in the Investment Building
partnership.

On December 20, 2005, the Company acquired a
46% partnership interest in, and became co-general partner of, partnerships
that own a complex in Rosslyn, Virginia, containing four office buildings with
an aggregate of 714,000 square feet and two apartment buildings containing 195
rental units. The consideration for the acquisition consisted of 734,486 newly
issued Vornado Realty L.P. partnership units (valued at $61,814,000) and
$27,300,000 of its pro-rata share of existing debt. Of the partnership interest
acquired, 19% was from Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod, trustees of
Vornado, and their family members, representing all of their interest in the
partnership.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company anticipates that cash from continuing
operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund its business
operations, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the
Operating Partnership and recurring capital expenditures, and together with
existing cash balances, will be greater than its anticipated cash requirements,
including development and redevelopment expenditures and debt amortization. Capital
requirements for significant acquisitions may require funding from
borrowings or equity offerings.

The Company’s believes that it has complied with the
financial covenants required by its revolving credit facility and its senior
unsecured notes due 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2025, and that as of December 31,
2005, it has the ability to incur a substantial amount of additional
indebtedness. As at December 31, 2005, the Company has an effective shelf
registration under which the Company can offer an aggregate of approximately
$836,750,000 of equity securities and Vornado Realty L.P. can offer an
aggregate of $4,510,000,000 of debt securities.

Certain Future Cash Requirements

For 2006 the Company has budgeted approximately $173,500,000
for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions as follows:

(1)

Americold, Hotel Pennsylvania, Paramus Office and Warehouses.

(2)

Tenant improvements and leasing commissions per square foot budgeted
  for 2006 leasing activity are $33.75 ($5.80 per annum) and $10.00 ($1.90 per
  annum) for Merchandise Mart office and showroom space, respectively.

In addition to the capital expenditures reflected
above, the Company is currently engaged in certain development and
redevelopment projects for which it has budgeted approximately $718,500,000. Of
this amount, $228,000,000 is estimated to be expended in 2006.

The table above excludes the anticipated 2006
capital expenditures of Alexander’s, Newkirk MLP, Toys “R” Us or any other
partially-owned entity that is not consolidated by the Company, as these
entities are expected to fund their own cash requirements without additional
equity contributions from the Company.


Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations

Below is a schedule of the Company’s
contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005.

At December 31, 2005,
the Company’s $600,000,000 revolving credit facility, which expires in July 2006,
had a zero outstanding balance and $22,311,000 was reserved for outstanding
letters of credit. This facility contains financial covenants, which require
the Company to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market
capitalization, and provides for higher interest rates in the event of a
decline in the Company’s ratings below Baa3/BBB. At December 31, 2005,
Americold’s $30,000,000 revolving credit facility had a $9,076,000 outstanding
balance and $17,000,000 was reserved for outstanding letters of credit. This
facility requires Americold to maintain, on a trailing four-quarter basis, a
minimum of $30,000,000 of free cash flow, as defined. Both of these facilities
contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations
and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give
rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest
or principal.

On March 29, 2005, the
Company completed a public offering of $500,000,000 principal amount of 3.875%
exchangeable senior debentures due 2025 pursuant to an effective registration
statement. The notes were sold at 98.0% of their principal amount. The net
proceeds from this offering, after the underwriters’ discount were
approximately $490,000,000. The debentures are exchangeable, under certain
circumstances, for common shares of the Company at a current exchange rate of
11.062199 (initial exchange rate of 10.9589) common shares per $1,000 of
principal amount of debentures. The Company may elect to settle any
exchange right in cash. The debentures permit the Company to increase its
common dividend 5% per annum, cumulatively, without an increase to the exchange
rate. The debentures are redeemable at the Company’s option beginning in 2012
for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the
debentures have the right to require the issuer to repurchase their debentures
in 2012, 2015 and 2020 and in the event of a change in control.

The Company has made acquisitions and investments in
partially-owned entities for which it is committed to fund additional capital aggregating
$40,800,000. Of this amount, $25,000,000 relates to capital expenditures to be
funded over the next six years at the Springfield Mall, in which it has a 97.5%
interest.

In addition to the above, on November 10, 2005,
the Company committed to fund up to $30,530,000 of the junior portion of a
$173,000,000 construction loan to an entity developing a mix-use building
complex in Boston, Massachusetts, at the north end of the Boston Harbor. The
Company will earn current-pay interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 11%. The loan will
mature in November 2008, with a one-year extension option. The Company
anticipates funding all or portions of the loan beginning in 2006.


The Company carries comprehensive liability and all
risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended
coverage, (iv) “acts of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk
Insurance Extension Act of 2005 which expires in 2007 and (v) rental loss
insurance) with respect to its assets. Below is a summary of the current all
risk property insurance and terrorism risk insurance in effect through September 2006
for each of the following business segments:

(1)

Limited as to terrorism insurance by the
sub-limit shown in the adjacent column.

In addition to the coverage above, the Company
carries lesser amounts of coverage for terrorist acts not covered by the
Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005.

The Company’s debt instruments, consisting of
mortgage loans secured by its properties (which are generally non-recourse to
the Company), its senior unsecured notes due 2007, 2009 and 2010, its
exchangeable senior debentures due 2025 and its revolving credit agreements,
contain customary covenants requiring the Company to maintain insurance. Although
the Company believes that it has adequate insurance coverage under these
agreements, the Company may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage
at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater
coverage than the Company is able to obtain, or if the Terrorism Risk Insurance
Extension Act of 2005 is not extended past 2007, it could adversely affect the
Company’s ability to finance and/or refinance its properties and expand its
portfolio.

Each of the Company’s properties has been subjected
to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The
environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental
contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of
new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of
contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup
requirements would not result in significant costs to the Company.

On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed
a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New
Jersey (“USDC-NJ”) claiming the Company has no right to reallocate and
therefore continue to collect $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop &
Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty. On May 17, 2005, the
Company filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop &
Shop opposed the Company’s motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.
On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the motions
for summary judgment. The Company intends to pursue its claims against Stop &
Shop vigorously. There are various other legal actions against the Company in
the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, after
consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a
material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
cash flow.

The Company enters into agreements for the purchase
and resale of U.S. government obligations for periods of up to one week. The
obligations purchased under these agreements are held in safekeeping in the
name of the Company by various money center banks. The Company has the right to
demand additional collateral or return of these invested funds at any time the
collateral value is less than 102% of the invested funds plus any accrued
earnings thereon. The Company had $177,650,000 and $23,110,000 of cash invested
in these agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

From time to time, the Company has disposed of
substantial amounts of real estate to third parties for which, as to certain
properties, it remains contingently liable for rent payments or mortgage
indebtedness that cannot be quantified by the Company.

Below are the details of 2003 capital expenditures,
leasing commissions and development and redevelopment expenditures.


Funds From Operations (“FFO”)

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition
adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss
determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”),
excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from
sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified
non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and
after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO and
FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and industry analysts
as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs. FFO and FFO
per diluted share should be evaluated along with GAAP net income and income per
diluted share (the most directly comparable GAAP measures), as well as cash
flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities,
in evaluating the operating performance of equity REITs. Management believes
that FFO and FFO per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental
performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation,
amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are
based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real
estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have
historically risen or fallen with market conditions, these non-GAAP measures
can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among
other equity REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating
activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash
available to fund cash needs as disclosed in the Company’s Statements of Cash
Flows. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an
indicator of the Company’s operating performance or as an alternative to cash
flows as a measure of liquidity. The calculations of both the numerator and
denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note
16 - Income per Share, in the Company’s notes to consolidated financial
statements on page 173 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

FFO applicable to common shares plus assumed
conversions was $757,219,000, or $5.21 per diluted share for the year ended December 31,
2005, compared to $750,043,000, or $5.63 per diluted share for the year ended December 31,
2004. FFO applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions was $194,101,000
or $1.26 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2005,
compared to $299,441,000, or $2.22 per diluted share for the three months ended
December 31, 2004.


The Company records its 32.95% share of Toys FFO or
negative FFO on a one-quarter lag basis. FFO for the three months and year
ended December 31, 2005, includes the Company’s 32.95% share of Toys’
negative FFO of $33,376,000 or $0.20 per share and $32,918,000 or $0.20 per
share, respectively, and certain items that affect comparability as detailed in
the table below. Before these items and the Company’s share of Toys results,
FFO per share is 1.0% lower than the prior year and is 0.8% higher than the
prior year’s quarter.


ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company has exposure to fluctuations in market
interest rates. Market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors
beyond the control of the Company. Various financial vehicles exist which would
allow management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the
Company’s cash flows and earnings.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company has an
interest rate swap as described in footnote 1 to the table below. Management may engage
in additional hedging strategies in the future, depending on management’s
analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such
strategies.

The Company’s exposure to a change in interest rates
on its consolidated and non-consolidated debt (all of which arises out of
non-trading activity) is as follows:

($ in thousands, except per share amounts)

(1)

Includes $499,445 and $512,791, respectively,
for the Company’s senior unsecured notes due 2007, as the Company entered into
interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted the interest rate from
a fixed rate of 5.625% to a floating rate of LIBOR plus .7725%, based upon the
trailing 3 month LIBOR rate (4.53% at December 31, 2005). In
accordance with SFAS No. 133: Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, as amended, accounting for these swaps requires the
Company to fair value the debt at each reporting period. At December 31,
2005 and 2004, the fair value adjustment was ($341) and $13,148, and is
included in the balance of the senior unsecured notes above.

The fair value of the Company’s debt, based on
discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made
to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt,
exceeds the aggregate carrying amount by approximately $50,058,000 at December 31,
2005.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company has
mezzanine loans receivable of $209,248,000 on which the Company receives
interest based on a variable rate (a fixed spread plus 30, 60 or 90 day LIBOR).
The Company believes that a portion of its exposure to a change in interest
rates on its floating rate debt, as illustrated above, is partially mitigated
by the outstanding amounts of these loans receivable.

The Company has the following
derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment:

Upon consummation of the merger between Sears
and Kmart on March 30, 2005, the Company’s derivative position
representing 7,916,900 Sears common shares became a derivative position
representing 2,491,819 common shares of Sears Holding valued at $323,936,000
based on the $130.00 per share closing price on March 30, 2005, the
date of the merger, and $146,663,000 of cash. As a result, the Company
recognized a net gain of approximately $58,443,000 based on the fair value of
the Company’s derivative position after the exchange of these underlying assets.
Because this derivative position does not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market at the
end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in “interest
and other investment income” on the Company’s consolidated statement of income.
For the period from March 31, 2005 through December 31, 2005, the
Company recorded an expense of $43,475,000 from the derivative position, which
consists of (i) $30,230,000 from the mark-to-market of the remaining
shares in the derivative based on Sears Holdings $115.53 closing share price on
December 31, 2005, (ii) $2,509,000 for the net loss on the shares
sold based on a weighted average sales price of $123.77 and (iii) $10,736,000
resulting primarily from the increase in the strike price at an annual rate of
LIBOR plus 45 basis points.

During the three months ended September 30,
2005, the Company acquired an economic interest in 14,565,000 McDonalds common
shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a
financial institution pursuant to which the Company purchased a call option and
simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on McDonalds’ common
shares. These call and put options have an initial weighted-average strike
price of $32.66 per share, or an aggregate of $475,692,000, expire on various
dates between July 30, 2007 and September 10, 2007 and provide for
net cash settlement. Under the agreement, the strike price for each pair of
options increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points (up to 95
basis points under certain circumstances) and is credited for the dividends
received on the shares. The options provide the Company with the same economic
gain or loss as if it had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed
the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because
these options are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the options
at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease
in “interest and other investment income” on the Company’s consolidated
statement of income. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company
recorded net income of $17,254,000, comprised of (i) $15,239,000 from the
mark-to-market of the options on December 31, 2005, based on McDonalds’
closing stock price of $33.72 per share, (ii) $9,759,000 of dividend
income, partially offset by (iii) $7,744,000 for the increase in strike
price resulting from the LIBOR charge.

Under a warrant agreement with GMH Communities L.P.,
the Company holds 5.9 million warrants to purchase partnership units of GMH or
GCT common shares at an adjusted exercise price of $8.50 per unit or share. Because
these warrants are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the
warrants at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or
decrease in “interest and other investment income” on the Company’s
consolidated statement of income. In the year ended December 31, 200

5,
the Company recorded $14,079,000 of income from the mark-to-market of these
warrants based on GCT’s closing stock price on the NYSE of $15.51 per share on December 31,
2005.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Vornado Realty Trust and its majority-owned subsidiary,
Vornado Realty L.P.  All significant
intercompany amounts have been eliminated. 
The Company accounts for its unconsolidated partially-owned entities on
the equity method of accounting.  See
below for further details of the Company’s accounting policies regarding
partially-owned entities.

The Company’s consolidated financial statements are
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual
results could differ materially from those estimates.

Significant Accounting Policies

Real Estate:

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation and amortization. 
Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly related to the
acquisition, improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to
operations as incurred.  For
redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book value of the
existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and
improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to
the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated
fair value of the redeveloped property when complete.  If the cost of the redeveloped property,
including the undepreciated net book value of the property carried forward,
exceeds the estimated fair value of redeveloped property, the excess is charged
to expense.  Depreciation is provided on
a straight-line basis over the assets’ estimated useful lives which range from
7 to 40 years.  Tenant allowances are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which
approximates the useful lives of the assets. 
Additions to real estate include interest expense capitalized during
construction of $15,582,000 and $8,718,000, for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

Upon acquisitions of real estate, the Company assesses
the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements,
and identified intangibles such as above and below market leases and acquired
in-place leases and customer relationships) and acquired liabilities in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141:
Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
and allocates purchase price based on these assessments.  The Company assesses fair value based on
estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and
capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a
number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and
market/economic conditions that may affect the property.  The Company’s properties, including any related
intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances
change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be
recoverable.

Partially-Owned Entities:

The
Company considers APB 18: The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
Common Stock, SOP 78-9: Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures,
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) 96-16: Investors Accounting for an Investee
When the Investor has the Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority
Partners have Certain Approval or Veto Rights and FASB Interpretation No. 46
(Revised 2003): Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities — An Interpretation
of ARB No. 51 (“FIN 46R”), to determine the method of accounting for each of
its partially-owned entities.  In determining
whether the Company has a controlling interest in a partially-owned entity and
the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, it considers
factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management
representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive
participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a
variable interest entity in which it will absorb the majority of the entity’s
expected losses, if they occur, or receive the majority of the expected
residual returns, if they occur, or both. 
The Company has concluded that it does not control a partially-owned
entity, despite an ownership interest of 50% or greater, if the entity is not
considered a variable interest entity and the approval of all of the
partners/members is contractually required with respect to major decisions,
such as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange or other disposition
of real property, the hiring of a chief executive officer, the commencement,
compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or arbitration or the
placement of new or additional financing secured by assets of the venture.  This is the case with respect to the Company’s
50% interests in Monmouth Mall, MartParc Wells, MartParc Orleans, H Street,
Beverly Connection, 478-486 Broadway, 968 Third Avenue and 825 Seventh Avenue.

Identified Intangible Assets and
Goodwill:

Upon an acquisition of a
business the Company records intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair
value separate and apart from goodwill. 
The Company amortizes identified intangible assets that are determined
to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are
expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the
business acquired.  Intangible assets
subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be
recoverable.  An impairment loss is
recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and
its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.

The excess of the cost of an acquired entity over
the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified
intangible assets) and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.  Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for
impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit on an annual
basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the asset might be impaired.  An
impairment loss for an asset group is allocated to the long-lived assets of the
group on a pro-rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets,
unless the fair value of specific components of the reporting group are
determinable without undue cost and effort.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying amounts
of the Company’s identified intangible assets are $197,014,000 and $176,122,000
and the carrying amounts of goodwill are $11,122,000 and $10,425,000,
respectively.  Such amounts are included
in “other assets” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.  In addition, the Company has $146,325,000 and
$70,264,000 of identified intangible liabilities as of December 31, 2005 and
2004, which are included in “deferred credit” on the Company’s consolidated
balance sheets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly
liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less.
Cash and cash equivalents do not include cash escrowed under loan agreements
and cash restricted in connection with an officer’s deferred compensation
payable.  Cash and cash equivalents
include repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government obligations
totaling $177,650,000 and $23,110,000 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held
at major commercial banks which may at times exceed the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation limit of $100,000. 
The Company has not experienced any losses to date on its invested cash.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:

The Company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from
tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the
lease agreements.  The Company also
maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of
rents.  This receivable arises from
earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease
agreements.  Management exercises
judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and
current credit status in developing these estimates.

Marketable Securities:

The Company classifies debt and equity
securities which it intends to hold for an indefinite period of time as
securities available-for-sale; equity securities it intends to buy and sell on
a short term basis as trading securities; and mandatory redeemable preferred
stock investments as securities held to maturity.  Unrealized gains and losses on trading
securities are included in earnings. 
Unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale are
included as a component of shareholders’ equity and other comprehensive
income.  Realized gains or losses on the
sale of securities are recorded based on specific identification.  A portion of the Company’s preferred stock
investments are accounted for in accordance with EITF 99-20: Recognition of
Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests
in Securitized Financial Assets.  Income
is recognized by applying the prospective method of adjusting the yield to
maturity based on an estimate of future cash flows.  If the value of the investment based on the
present value of the future cash flows is less than the Company’s carrying
amount, the investments will be written-down to fair value through
earnings.  Investments in non-publicly
traded securities are reported at cost, as they are not considered marketable
under SFAS No. 115: Accounting For Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, marketable securities
had an aggregate cost of $132,536,000 and $135,382,000 and an aggregate fair
value of $276,146,000 and $185,394,000, of which $272,949,000 and $178,999,000
represents securities available for sale; and $3,197,000 and $6,395,000
represent securities held to maturity. 
Unrealized gains and losses were $90,210,000 and $1,046,000 at
December 31, 2005 and $50,012,000 and $0 at December 31, 2004.

Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable:

The Company’s policy is to record notes and mortgage loans receivable at the
stated principal amount less any discount or premium.  The Company accretes or amortizes any
discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan receivable utilizing
the straight-line method which approximates the effective interest method.  The Company evaluates the collectibility of
both interest and principal of each of its loans, if circumstances warrant, to
determine whether it is impaired. A loan is considered to be impaired when,
based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will
be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual
terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of the loss accrual
is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by
discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan’s effective interest
rate or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan
is collateral dependent.

Deferred Charges:

Direct
financing costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related
agreements as a component of interest expense. Direct costs related to leasing
activities are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over
the lives of the related leases. All other deferred charges are amortized on a
straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate
method, in accordance with the terms of the agreements to which they relate.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

The Company has estimated the fair value of all financial instruments reflected
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at amounts which are based upon
an interpretation of available market information and valuation methodologies
(including discounted cash flow analyses with regard to fixed rate debt).  The fair value of the Company’s debt is
approximately $50,058,000 and $256,518,000 in excess of the aggregate carrying
amounts at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Such fair value estimates are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that would be realized upon disposition of the
Company’s financial instruments.

Derivative Instruments And Hedging
Activities:

SFAS No.
133: Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (“SFAS No.
133”), as amended and interpreted, establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities.  As required by SFAS No. 133, the Company
records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  The
accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended
use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge
the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm
commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are
considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted
transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

For derivatives designated as fair value hedges,
changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the
hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is
initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (outside of earnings)
and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects
earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the
derivative is recognized directly in earnings. 
The Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by
comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging
instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated
hedged item or transaction. For derivatives not designated as hedges, changes
in fair value are recognized in earnings.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company has the following revenue sources
and revenue recognition policies:

Base Rents — income arising from tenant leases.  These rents are recognized over the
non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which
includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.

Percentage Rents — income arising from retail tenant leases which are
contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold.  These rents are recognized in accordance with
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104: Revenue Recognition, which states that this
income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e.,
sales thresholds have been achieved).

Hotel Revenues — income arising from the operation of the Hotel
Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and
banquet revenue.  Income is recognized
when rooms are occupied.  Food and
beverage and banquet revenue is recognized when the services have been
rendered.

Trade Show Revenues — income arising from the operation of trade shows,
including rentals of booths.  This
revenue is recognized in accordance with the booth rental contracts when the
trade shows have occurred.

Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which
provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real
estate taxes of the respective property. 
This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are
incurred.  Contingent rents are not
recognized until realized.

Temperature Controlled Logistics revenue – income arising from the
Company’s investment in Americold. 
Storage and handling revenue are recognized as services are
provided.  Transportation fees are
recognized upon delivery to customers.

Management, Leasing and Other Fees – income arising from contractual
agreements with third parties or with partially-owned entities.  This revenue is recognized as the related
services are performed under the respective agreements.

Income Taxes:

The Company
operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a REIT under
Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under
those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable
income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain
other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which
is distributed to its shareholders.  The
Company will distribute to its shareholders 100% of its taxable income and
therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. Dividend
distributions for the year ended December 31, 2005 were characterized for
Federal income tax purposes as 93.6% ordinary income and 6.4% long-term capital
gain income.  Dividend distributions for
the year ended December 31, 2004 were characterized for Federal income tax
purposes as 94.8% ordinary income and 5.2% long-term capital gain income.  Dividend distributions for the year ended
December 31, 2003 were characterized for Federal income tax purposes as 94.5%
ordinary income and 5.5% long-term capital gain income.

The Company owns stock in corporations that have
elected to be treated for Federal income tax purposes, as taxable REIT
subsidiaries (“TRS”).  The value of the
combined TRS stock cannot and does not exceed 20% of the value of the Company’s
total assets.  A TRS is taxable on its
net income at regular corporate tax rates. 
The total income tax paid in the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003 was $8,672,000, $1,867,000 and $2,048,000, respectively.

The following table reconciles net income to estimated
taxable income for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

The net basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities
for tax purposes is approximately $3,231,076,000 lower than the amount reported
for financial statement purposes.

Income Per Share:

Basic income per share is computed based on
weighted average shares outstanding. 
Diluted income per share considers the effect of outstanding options,
restricted shares, warrants and convertible or redeemable securities.

Stock-Based Compensation:

In 2002 and prior years, the Company accounted
for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method. Under the
intrinsic value method compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of
the quoted market price of the Company’s stock at the date of grant over the
exercise price of the option granted. Compensation cost for stock options, if
any, is recognized ratably over the vesting period.  The Company’s policy is to grant options with
an exercise price equal to 100% of the market price of the Company’s stock on
the grant date. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the
Company’s stock option grants.  Effective
January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123: Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148: Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure and as revised by SFAS No. 123R:
Share-Based Payment.  The Company adopted
SFAS No. 123 prospectively by valuing and accounting for employee stock options
granted in 2003 and thereafter.  The
Company utilizes a binomial valuation model and appropriate market assumptions
to determine the value of each grant. 
Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the vesting period for all grants subsequent to 2002.  See Note 10. Stock-Based Compensation, for pro
forma net income and pro forma net income per share for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, assuming compensation costs for grants prior
to 2003 were recognized as compensation expense based on the fair value at the
grant dates.

In addition to employee stock option grants, the
Company has also granted restricted shares to certain of its employees that
vest over a three to five year period. 
The Company records the value of each restricted share award as
stock-based compensation expense based on the Company’s closing stock price on
the NYSE on the date of grant on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period.  As of December 31, 2005, the
Company has 260,267 restricted shares or rights to receive restricted shares
outstanding to employees of the Company, excluding 626,566 shares issued to the

Recently Issued
Accounting Literature

On December 16,
2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No.
153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets - An
Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.

The amendments made by SFAS No. 153
are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be
measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. Further, the
amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar
productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of
nonmonetary assets that do not have “commercial substance.” SFAS No. 153 is
effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning
after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 on its effective date did not
have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123:
(Revised 2004) -

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123R”).  SFAS No. 123R
replaces SFAS No. 123, which the Company adopted on January 1, 2003. SFAS No.
123R requires that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment
transactions be recognized in financial statements and measured based on the
fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS No. 123R is
effective as of the first annual reporting period beginning after December 31,
2005.  The Company has adopted SFAS No.
123R on a modified prospective method, effective January 1, 2006 and believes
that the adoption will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial
statements.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations

, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143,

Asset Retirement Obligations

.  FIN 47 provides clarification of the term “conditional
asset retirement obligation” as used in SFAS 143, defined as a legal obligation
to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of
settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the
control of the company.  Under this
standard, a company must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement
obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably
estimated.  FIN 47 became effective in
the Company’s fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2005.  Certain of the Company’s real estate assets
contain asbestos.  Although the asbestos
is appropriately contained, in accordance with current environmental
regulations, the Company’s practice is to remediate the asbestos upon the
renovation or redevelopment of its properties. 
Accordingly, the Company has determined that these assets meet the
criteria for recording a liability and has recorded an asset retirement
obligation aggregating approximately $8,400,000, which is included in “Other
Liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005.  The cumulative effect of adopting this
standard was approximately $2,500,000, and is included in “Depreciation and
Amortization” on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended
December 31, 2005.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections – A
Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and SFAS No. 3.

SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for the
accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle by requiring that
a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all
prior periods’ financial statements presented on the new accounting principle,
unless it is impracticable to do so. 
SFAS No. 154 also requires that a change in depreciation or amortization
for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting
estimate effected by a change in accounting principle and corrections of errors
in previously issued financial statements should be termed a “restatement”.  SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting
changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2005.  The Company believes that the
adoption of SFAS No. 154 will not have a material effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached
by the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) on Issue No. 04-05, “Determining
Whether a General Partner, or General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited
Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights” (“EITF
04-05”).  EITF 04-05 provides a framework
for determining whether a general partner controls, and should consolidate, a
limited partnership or a similar entity. 
EITF 04-05 became effective on June 29, 2005, for all newly formed or
modified limited partnership arrangements and January 1, 2006 for all existing
limited partnership arrangements.  The
Company believes that the adoption of this standard will not have a material
effect on its consolidated financial statements.

Acquisitions:

The Company completed approximately $2,379,750,000 of
real estate acquisitions and investments in 2005 and $328,600,000 in 2004.  In addition, the Company made $308,534,000 of
mezzanine loans during 2005 and $183,400,000 in 2004 (see Note 6. Notes and
Mortgage Loans Receivable).  These
acquisitions were consummated through subsidiaries of the Company.  The related assets, liabilities and results
of operations are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements
from their respective dates of acquisition. 
The pro forma effect of the individual acquisitions and in the aggregate
were not material to the Company’s historical results of operations.

Acquisitions of individual properties are recorded as
acquisitions of real estate assets. 
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting. The purchase price for property acquisitions and businesses
acquired is allocated to acquired assets and assumed liabilities using their
relative fair values as of the acquisition date based on valuations and other
studies. Initial valuations are subject to change until such information is
finalized no later than 12 months from the acquisition date.

Office:

Crystal City Marriott

On July 1, 2004, the Company
acquired the Marriott hotel located in its Crystal City office complex from a
limited partnership in which Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod, trustees of
the Company, together with family members, own approximately 67 percent.  The purchase price of $21,500,000 was paid in
cash

as part of a Section 1031 tax-free, “like-kind” exchange with a
portion of the proceeds from the Company’s sale of the Palisades Residential
Complex (see Dispositions)

.  The hotel contains 343 rooms and is leased to
an affiliate of Marriott International, Inc. until July 31, 2015, with one
10-year extension option.  The land under
the hotel was acquired in 1999.  This
property is consolidated into the accounts of the Company from the date of
acquisition.

Bowen Building

On June 13, 2005, the Company acquired the 90% that it
did not already own of the Bowen Building, a 231,000 square foot class A office
building located at 875 15

th

Street N.W. in the Central Business
District of Washington, D.C.  The
purchase price was $119,000,000, consisting of $63,000,000 in cash and
$56,000,000 of existing mortgage debt, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.5%
(5.66% as of December 31, 2005) and is due in February 2007.  The operations of the Bowen Building are
consolidated into the accounts of the Company from the date of this
acquisition.

H Street Building
Corporation (“H Street”)

On July 20, 2005, the Company acquired H Street, which
owns directly or indirectly through stock ownership in corporations, a 50%
interest in real estate assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia, including 34
acres of land leased to various residential and retail operators, a 1,670 unit
apartment complex, 10 acres of land and two office buildings located in
Washington, DC containing 577,000 square feet. The purchase price was
approximately $246,600,000, consisting of $194,500,000 in cash and
$52,100,000 for the Company’s pro rata share of existing mortgage
debt.  The operations of H Street are
consolidated into the accounts of the Company from the date of acquisition.

On July 22, 2005, two corporations owned 50% by H Street
filed a complaint against the Company, H Street and three parties affiliated
with the sellers of H Street in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia
alleging that the Company encouraged H Street and the affiliated parties to
breach their fiduciary duties to these corporations and interfered with
prospective business and contractual relationships.  The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of
damages and a rescission of the Company’s acquisition of H Street.   In addition, on July 29, 2005, a tenant
under a ground lease with one of these corporations brought a separate suit in
the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, alleging, among other things,
that the Company’s acquisition of H Street violated a provision giving them a
right of first offer and on that basis seeks a rescission of the Company’s
acquisition and the right to acquire H Street for the price paid by the
Company.  On September 12, 2005, the
Company filed a complaint against each of these corporations and their acting
directors seeking a restoration of H Street’s full shareholder rights and
damages.  These legal actions are
currently in the discovery stage.

In connection with these legal actions, the
Company has accrued legal fees of $2,134,000 in the fourth quarter of 2005, which
are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated
statement of income.

The Company
believes that the actions filed against the Company are without merit and that
it will ultimately be successful in defending against them.

Because of the legal actions described above, the
Company has not been granted access to the financial information of these two
corporations and accordingly has not recorded its share of their net income or
loss or disclosed its

pro
rata share of their outstanding debt in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.

Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”)

On July 21, 2005, a joint venture owned equally by the
Company, Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. acquired Toys for
$26.75 per share in cash or approximately $6.6 billion.  In connection therewith, the Company invested
$428,000,000 of the $1.3 billion of equity in the venture, consisting of
$407,000,000 in cash and $21,000,000 in Toys common shares held by the
Company.  This investment is accounted
for under the equity method of accounting.

The business of Toys is highly seasonal.  Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income
accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income.  Because Toys’ fiscal year ends on the
Saturday nearest January 31, the Company records its 32.95% share of Toys net
income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis. 
Accordingly, the Company will record its share of Toys fourth quarter
net income in its first quarter of 2006. 
Equity in net loss from Toys for the period from July 21, 2005 (date of
acquisition) through December 31, 2005 was $40,496,000 which consisted of (i)
the Company’s $1,977,000 share of Toys net loss in Toys’ second quarter ended
July 30, 2005 for the period from July 21, 2005 (date of acquisition) through
July 30, 2005, (ii) the Company’s $44,812,000 share of Toys net loss in Toys’
third quarter ended October 29, 2005, partially offset by, (iii) $5,043,000 of
interest income on the Company’s senior unsecured bridge loan described below
and (iv) $1,250,000 of management fees.

On August 29, 2005, the Company acquired $150,000,000
of the $1.9 billion one-year senior unsecured bridge loan financing provided to
Toys.  The loan is senior to the
acquisition equity of $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion of existing debt.  The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 5.25%
(9.43% as of December 31, 2005) not to exceed 11% and provides for an initial
..375% placement fee and additional fees of .375% at the end of three and six
months if the loan has not been repaid. 
The loan is prepayable at any time without penalty.  On December 9, 2005, $73,184,000 of this loan
was repaid to the Company.

On January 9,
2006, Toys announced plans and is in the process of closing 87 Toys “R” Us
stores in the United States, of which twelve stores will be converted into
Babies “R” Us stores, five leased properties are expiring and one has been sold.  Vornado is handling the leasing and
disposition of the real estate of the remaining 69 stores. As a result of the
store-closing program, Toys will incur restructuring and other charges
aggregating approximately $155,000,000 before tax, which includes $45,000,000
for the cost of liquidating inventory. 
Of this amount, approximately $99,000,000 will be recorded in Toys’
fourth quarter ending January 28, 2006 and $56,000,000 will be recorded in the
first quarter of their next fiscal year. 
These estimated amounts are preliminary and remain subject to
change.  The Company’s 32.95% share of
the $155,000,000 charge is $51,000,000, of which $36,000,000 will have no
income statement effect as a result of purchase price accounting and the
remaining portion relating to the cost of liquidating the inventory of
approximately $9,000,000 after-tax, will be recorded as an expense in the first
quarter of 2006.

loan which bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.50% (8.04% as of December 31, 2005)
which is due in August 2006, with two six-month extensions.  The property contains 122 rental apartments
with an aggregate of 133,000 square feet and 5,700 square feet of commercial
space.  The operations of 220 Central
Park South are consolidated into the accounts of the Company from the date of
acquisition.

Other

In addition to the acquisitions and investments
described above, the Company made $281,500,000 of other acquisitions and
investments during 2005, which are summarized below:

(1)

On May 31, 2005, the Company
contributed $50,000 in cash to Dune Capital L.P., a limited partnership
involved in corporate, real estate and asset-based investments.  The Company’s investment represented a 3.5%
limited partnership interest for the period from May 31, 2005 through September
30, 2005.  On October 1, 2005, Dune
Capital made a return of capital to one of its investors and the Company’s
ownership interest was effectively increased to 5.4%.  The Company initially accounted for this
investment on the cost method based on its ownership interest on May 31,
2005.  Subsequent to October 1, 2005, the
Company accounts for its investment on the equity method on a one-quarter lag
basis.  Dune Capital’s financial
statements are prepared on a market value basis and changes in value from one
reporting period to the next are recognized in income.  Accordingly, the Company’s share of Dune
Capital’s net income or loss will reflect such changes in market value.

Other Investments

:

Investment in Sears, Roebuck
and Co. (“Sears”)

In July and August 2004, the
Company acquired an aggregate of 1,176,600 common shares of Sears, Roebuck and
Co. (“Sears”) for $41,945,000, an average price of $35.65 per share.

On
March 30, 2005, upon consummation of the merger between Sears and Kmart, the
Company received 370,330 common shares of Sears Holdings Corporation
(Nasdaq:  SHLD) (“Sears Holdings”) and
$21,797,000 of cash in exchange for its 1,176,600 Sears common shares.  The Sears Holdings common shares were valued
at $48,143,000, based on the March 30, 2005 closing share price of
$130.00.  As a result the Company
recognized a net gain of $27,651,000, the difference between the aggregate cost
basis in the Sears shares and the market value of the total consideration received
of $69,940,000.  On April 4, 2005, 99,393
of the Company’s Sears Holdings common shares with a value of $13,975,000 were
utilized to satisfy a third-party participation.  The remaining 270,937 Sears Holdings shares
were sold in the fourth quarter of 2005 at a weighted average sales price of
$125.83 per share, which resulted in a net loss on disposition of $1,137,000,
based on the March 30, 2005 adjusted cost basis of $130.00 per share.   The Company’s net gain on its investment in
these Sears shares was $26,514,000.

In August and September 2004, the Company acquired an
economic interest in an additional 7,916,900 Sears common shares through a
series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution
pursuant to which the Company purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a
put option at the same strike price on Sears common shares.  These call and put options had an initial
weighted-average strike price of  $39.82
per share, or an aggregate of $315,250,000, expire in April 2006 and provide
for net cash settlement.  Under these
agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increases at an annual
rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and is credited for the dividends received
on the shares.  The options provide the
Company with the same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the
underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual
rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. 
Because these options are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of
the options at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase
or decrease in “interest and other investment income” on the Company’s
consolidated statement of income.

On March 30, 2005, as a result of the merger between
Sears and Kmart and pursuant to the terms of the contract, the Company’s
derivative position representing 7,916,900 Sears common shares became a
derivative position representing 2,491,819 common shares of Sears Holdings
valued at $323,936,000 based on the then closing share price of $130.00 and
$146,663,000 of cash.  As a result, the
Company recognized a net gain of $58,443,000 based on the fair value of the
derivative position on March 30, 2005. 
During the fourth quarter of 2005, 402,660 of the common shares were
sold at a weighted average sales price of $123.77 per share.  In accordance with the derivative agreements,
the proceeds from these sales will remain in the derivative position until the
entire position is settled or until expiration in April 2006.  Based on Sears Holdings’ closing share price
on December 31, 2005 of $115.53, the remaining shares in the derivative
position have a market value of $241,361,000, which together with cash of
$196,499,000 aggregates $437,860,000.  In
the period from March 31, 2005 through December 31, 2005, the Company recorded
an expense of $43,475,000 from the derivative position, which consists of (i)
$30,230,000 from the mark-to-market of the remaining shares in the derivative based
on Sears Holdings $115.53 closing share price on December 31, 2005, (ii)
$2,509,000 for the net loss on the shares sold based on a weighted average
sales price of $123.77 and (iii) $10,736,000 resulting primarily from the
increase in the strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points.

The Company’s aggregate net income recognized on the
owned shares and the derivative position from inception to December 31, 2005
was $124,266,000.

Investment in Sears Canada, Inc. (“Sears
Canada”)

In connection with the Company’s investment in Sears
Holdings Corporation, the Company acquired 7,500,000 common shares of Sears
Canada between February and September of 2005 for an aggregate cost of
$143,737,000, or $19.16 per share.  On
December 16, 2005, Sears Canada paid a special dividend, of which Vornado’s
share was $120,500,000.  As a result, the
Company recognized $22,885,000 of income in the fourth quarter of 2005 (in
addition to the unrecognized gain of $53,870,000 discussed below) and paid a
$.77 special cash dividend on December 30, 2005 to shareholders of record on
December 27, 2005.  The Company accounts
for its investment in Sears Canada as a marketable equity security classified
as available-for-sale.  Accordingly, the
common shares are marked-to-market on a quarterly basis through “Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income” on the balance sheet.  At December 31, 2005, based on a closing
share price of $15.47, the unrecognized gain in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income is $53,870,000.

Investment in

McDonald’s Corporation (“McDonalds”) (NYSE: MCD)

In July 2005, the Company acquired an aggregate of
858,000 common shares of McDonalds for $25,346,000, an average price of $29.54
per share. These shares are recorded as marketable equity securities on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet and are classified as “available for sale.”  Appreciation or depreciation in the fair
market value of these shares is recorded as an increase or decrease in
“accumulated other comprehensive income” in the shareholders’ equity section of
the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and not recognized in income.  At December 31, 2005, based on McDonalds’
closing stock price of $33.72 per share, $3,585,000 of appreciation in the
value of these shares was included in “accumulated other comprehensive income.”

During the three months ended September 30, 2005, the
Company acquired an economic interest in an additional 14,565,000 McDonalds
common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a
financial institution pursuant to which the Company purchased a call option and
simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on McDonalds’ common
shares.  These call and put options have
an initial weighted-average strike price of 
$32.66 per share, or an aggregate of $475,692,000, expire on various
dates between July 30, 2007 and September 10, 2007 and provide for net cash
settlement.  Under these agreements, the
strike price for each pair of options increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus
45 basis points (up to 95 basis points under certain circumstances) and is
credited for the dividends received on the shares.  The options provide the Company with the same
economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the underlying common shares and
borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis
points.  Because these options are
derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or
losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each
reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in “interest and
other investment income” on the Company’s consolidated statement of
income.  During the year ended December
31, 2005, the Company recorded net income of $17,254,000, comprised of (i)
$15,239,000 from the mark-to-market of the options on December 31, 2005, based
on McDonalds’ closing stock price of $33.72 per share, (ii) $9,759,000 of
dividend income, partially offset by (iii) $7,744,000 for the increase in
strike price resulting from the LIBOR charge.

Based on McDonalds’ most recent filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company’s aggregate investment in
McDonalds represents 1.2% of its outstanding common shares.

Dispositions:

Temperature Controlled Logistics

Prior to November 18, 2004, the Company owned a 60%
interest in Vornado Crescent Portland Partnership (“VCPP”) which owned
Americold Realty Trust (“Americold”). 
Americold owned 88 temperature controlled warehouses, all of which were
leased to AmeriCold Logistics.  On
November 4, 2004, Americold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for
$47,700,000 in cash.  On November 18,
2004, the Company and its 40% partner, Crescent Real Estate Equities Company (“CEI”)
collectively sold 20.7% of Americold’s common shares to The Yucaipa Companies (“Yucaipa”)
for $145,000,000, which resulted in a gain, of which the Company’s share was
$18,789,000. The sale price was based on a $1.450 billion valuation for
Americold before debt and other obligations. 
Yucaipa is a private equity firm with significant expertise in the food
distribution, logistics and retail industries. 
Upon closing of the sale to Yucaipa on November 18, 2004, Americold is
owned 47.6% by the Company, 31.7% by CEI and 20.7% by Yucaipa.

Pursuant to the sales agreement: (i) Yucaipa may be
entitled to received up to 20% of the increase in the value of Americold,
realized through the sale of a portion of the Company’s and CEI’s interests in
Americold subject to limitations, provided that Americold’s Threshold EBITDA,
as defined, exceeds $133,500,000 at December 31, 2007; (ii) the annual asset
management fee payable by CEI to the Company has been reduced from
approximately $5,500,000 to $4,548,000, payable quarterly through October 30,
2027.  CEI, at its option, may terminate
the payment of this fee at any time after November 2009, by paying the Company a
termination fee equal to the present value of the remaining payments through
October 30, 2027, discounted at 10%.  In
addition, CEI is obligated to pay a pro rata portion of the termination fee to
the extent it sells a portion of its equity interest in Americold; and (iii)
VCPP was dissolved.  The Company has the
right to appoint three of the five members to Americold’s Board of
Trustees.  Consequently, the Company is
deemed to exercise control over Americold and, on November 18, 2004, the
Company began to consolidate the operations and financial position of Americold
into its accounts and no longer accounts for its investment on the equity
method.

exchange the 3,972,447 units it owned in Prime Group Realty L.P. for 3,972,447
common shares in Prime Group Realty Trust (NYSE:PGE).  Prior to the exchange, the Company accounted
for its investment in the partnership on the equity method.  Subsequent to the exchange, the Company
accounted for its investment in PGE as a marketable equity security-available
for sale, as the Company’s shares represent less than a 20% ownership interest
in PGE (which is not a partnership), the Company did not have significant
influence and the common shares had a readily determinable fair value.  On July 1, 2005, a third party acquired all
of Prime’s outstanding common shares and limited partnership units for $7.25
per share or unit.  In connection
therewith, the Company recognized a gain of $9,017,000, representing the
difference between the purchase price and the Company’s carrying amount.

interest at 5.33%, matures in February 2014 and beginning in the third year,
provides for principal payments based on a 25-year amortization schedule such
that over the remaining eight years of the loan, ten years of amortization will
be paid.  Of the loan proceeds,
$253,529,000 was used to repay the entire amount outstanding under the

right notes encumbering certain of Newkirk MLP’s properties.  The other loan, in the initial principal
amount of $477,800,000 is collateralized by Newkirk MLP’s properties, subject
to the existing first and certain second mortgage loans on those
properties.  The new loans bear interest
at LIBOR plus 1.75% (5.87% as of December 31, 2005) and mature in August 2008,
with two one-year extension options.  The
loans are prepayable without penalty after August 2006.  The proceeds of the new loans were used to
repay approximately $708,737,000 of existing debt and accrued interest and $34,500,000
of prepayment penalties and closing costs. 
The Company’s $7,992,000 share of the losses on the early extinguishment
of debt and write-off of the related deferred financing costs are included in
the equity in net loss of Newkirk MLP in the year ended December 31, 2005.

On November 2, 2005,
Newkirk Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE: NKT) (“Newkirk REIT”) completed an initial
public offering and in conjunction therewith acquired a controlling interest in
Newkirk MLP and became its sole general partner.  Prior to the public offering, the Company
owned a 22.4% interest in Newkirk MLP. 
Subsequent to the offering, the Company owns approximately 15.8% of
Newkirk MLP.  The Company’s 10,186,991
partnership units in Newkirk MLP are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into
common shares of Newkirk REIT after an IPO blackout that expires on November 7,
2006.

Upon completion of the initial public offering on
November 2, 2005, Newkirk MLP acquired the contract right notes and assumed the
obligations under the T-2 loan, which resulted in a net gain of $16,053,000 to
the Company.  In addition, on November 7,
2005, the Company transferred Newkirk MLP units to its partner to satisfy a
promoted obligation, which resulted in an expense of  $8,470,000 representing the book value of the
units transferred.

GMH Communities L.P.

On July 20, 2004, the Company committed to make up to
a $159,000,000 convertible preferred investment in GMH Communities L.P. (“GMH”),
a partnership focused on the student and military housing sectors.  Distributions accrued on the full committed
balance of the investment, whether or not drawn, from July 20, 2004, at a rate
of 16.27%.  In connection with this
commitment, the Company received a placement fee of $3,200,000.  The Company also purchased for $1,000,000,
warrants to acquire GMH common equity. 
The warrants entitled the Company to acquire (i) 6,666,667 limited
partnership units in GMH at an exercise price of $7.50 per unit and (ii)
5,496,724 limited partnership units at an exercise price of $9.10 per unit,
through May 6, 2006 and are adjusted for dividends declared by GCT.  The Company funded a total of $113,777,000 of
the commitment as of November 3, 2004.

On November 3, 2004, GMH Communities Trust (NYSE: GCT)
(“GCT”) closed its initial public offering (“IPO”) at a price of $12.00 per
share.  GCT is a real estate investment
trust that conducts its business through GMH, of which it is the sole general
partner.  In connection with the IPO, (i)
the $113,777,000 previously funded by the Company under the $159,000,000
commitment was repaid, together with accrued distributions of $13,381,000, (ii)
the Company contributed its 90% interest in Campus Club Gainesville, which
it acquired in 2000, in exchange for an additional 671,190 GMH limited
partnership units and (iii) the Company exercised its first tranche of warrants
to acquire 6,666,667 limited partnership units at a price of $7.50 per unit, or
an aggregate of $50,000,000, which resulted in a gain of $29,500,000.

As of

December 31,

, the Company owns 7,337,857 GMH partnership units (which are
exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common shares of GCT) and 700,000
common shares of GCT which were acquired from GCT in October 2005 for $14.25
per share, and holds warrants to purchase 5,884,727 GMH limited partnership
units or GCT common shares at a price of $8.50 per unit or share.  The Company’s aggregate investment represents
11.3% of the limited partnership interest in GMH.

The Company accounts for its investment in the GMH
partnership units and GCT common shares on the equity-method based on its
percentage ownership interest and because Michael D. Fascitelli, the Company’s
President, is a member of the Board of Trustees of GCT, effective August 10,
2005.  The Company records its pro-rata
share of GMH’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis as the Company
files its financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time GMH
files its financial statements.

The Company accounts for the warrants as derivative
instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  Accordingly, the gains or losses resulting
from the mark-to-market of the warrants at the end of each reporting period are
recognized as an increase or decrease in “interest and other investment income”
on the Company’s consolidated statements of income.  In the years ended December 31, 2005 and
2004, the Company recognized income of $14,079,000 and $24,190,000,
respectively, from the mark-to-market of these warrants which were valued using
a trinomial option pricing model based on GCT’s closing stock price on the NYSE
of $15.51 and $14.10 per share on December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

For Mr. Fascitelli’s service as a Director, on August
10, 2005 he received 4,034 restricted common shares of GCT at a price of $14.33
per share.  These shares vest in equal
installments over three years and are held by Mr. Fascitelli for the Company’s
benefit.

rate (4.53% if set on December 30, 2005).

value of ($341) and $13,148 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and

the fair value adjustment to the principal amount of the debt was ($341) and
$13,148, based on the fair value of the swap assets, and is included in the

underwriters exercised their option and purchased $10,000,000 Series I
Preferred Shares to cover over-allotments. 
On September 12, 2005, the Company sold an additional $85,000,000 Series
I Preferred Shares in a public offering, pursuant to an effective registration
statement.  Combined with the earlier
sales, the Company sold a total of 10,800,000 Series I preferred shares for net
proceeds of $262,898,000.  Holders of the
Series I Preferred Shares of beneficial interest are entitled to receive
dividends at an annual rate of 6.625% of the liquidation preference of $25.00
per share or $1.656 per Series I Preferred Share per annum.  The dividends are cumulative and payable
quarterly in arrears.  The Series I
Preferred Shares are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property
or any other securities of the Company at the election of the holders.  On or after August 31, 2010 (or sooner under
limited circumstances), the Company, at its option, may redeem Series I
Preferred Shares at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus any accrued
and unpaid dividends through the date of redemption.  The Series I Preferred Shares have no
maturity date and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless redeemed by the
Company.

Stock-based
Compensation

The Company’s Share Option Plan (the “Plan”) provides
for grants of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock,
stock appreciation rights and performance shares to certain employees and
officers of the Company.

Restricted stock awards are granted at the market
price on the date of grant and vest over a three to five year period.  The Company recognizes the value of
restricted stock as compensation expense based on the Company’s closing stock
price on the NYSE on the date of grant on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period.  As of December 31, 2005,
there are 260,267 restricted shares outstanding (excluding 626,566 shares
issued to the Company’s President in connection with his employment
agreement).  The Company recognized
$3,559,000, $4,200,000 and $3,239,000 of compensation expense in 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively, for the portion of these shares that vested during each
year.  Dividends paid on unvested shares
are charged directly to retained earnings and amounted to $1,038,000, $938,700
and $777,700 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Dividends on shares that are cancelled or
terminated prior to vesting are charged to compensation expense in the period
of the cancellation or termination.

Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal
to 100% of the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant,
generally vest pro-rata over three to five years and expire 10 years from the
date of grant.  As of December 31, 2005
there are 12,671,000 options outstanding. 
On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS 123: Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148: Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure, on a prospective basis
covering all grants subsequent to 2002. 
Under SFAS No. 123, the Company recognizes compensation expense for the
fair value of options granted on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period.  For the year ended December 31,
2005, and 2004, the Company recognized $1,042,000 and $102,900 of compensation
expense related to the options granted during 2005 and 2003.  Grants prior to 2003 are accounted for under
the intrinsic value method under which compensation expense is measured as the
excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the Company’s stock at the date
of grant over the exercise price of the option granted.  As the Company’s policy is to grant options
with an exercise price equal to 100% of the quoted market price on the grant
date, no compensation expense has been recognized for options granted prior to
2003.  If compensation cost for grants
prior to 2003 were recognized as compensation expense based on the fair value
at the grant dates, net income and income per share would have been reduced to
the pro-forma amounts below:

Compensation - continued

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on
the date of grant using an option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in the periods ending December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003.  There were no stock option
grants during 2004.  In 2005, 933,471
stock options and 73,411 restricted shares were granted to certain employees.  The stock options were granted at an exercise
price equal to 100% of the market price on the date of grant.

A summary of the Plan’s status and changes during the
years then ended, is presented below:

The following table summarizes information about
options outstanding under the Plan at December 31, 2005:

Shares available for future grant under the Plan at December 31,

Retirement
Plans

The Company has two defined benefit pension plans, a
Vornado Realty Trust Retirement Plan (“Vornado Plan”) and a Merchandise Mart
Properties Pension Plan (“Mart Plan”). 
In addition, Americold Realty Trust, which is consolidated into the
accounts of the Company beginning November 18, 2004, has two defined benefit
pension plans (the “AmeriCold Plans” and together with the Vornado Plan and the
Mart Plan “the Plans”).  The benefits
under the Vornado Plan and the Mart Plan were frozen in December 1997 and June 1999,
respectively.  In April 2005, Americold
amended its Americold Retirement Income Plan to freeze benefits for non-union
participants.  Benefits under the Plans
are or were primarily based on years of service and compensation during
employment or on years of credited service and established monthly
benefits.  Funding policy for the Plans
is based on contributions at the minimum amounts required by law.  The financial results of the Plans are
consolidated in the information provided below.

The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for
the Plans.

Obligations and Funded Status

The following table sets forth the Plans’ funded
status and amounts recognized in the Company’s balance sheets:

short term are recognized as gains or losses in the periods that they occur.

Leases

As lessor:

The Company leases space to tenants under operating
leases. Most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base rentals
payable monthly in advance. Shopping center leases provide for the pass-through
to tenants of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance. Office building
leases generally require the tenants to reimburse the Company for operating
costs and real estate taxes above their base year costs. Shopping center leases
also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rent based on a
percentage of the tenants’ sales. As of December 31, 2005, future base
rental revenue under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding rents for
leases with an original term of less than one year and rents resulting from the
exercise of renewal options, is as follows:

These amounts do not include rentals based on tenants’
sales.  These percentage rents
approximated $6,571,000, $5,563,000, and $3,662,000, for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

None of the Company’s tenants represented more than
10% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Former
Bradlees Locations

Pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, dated
May 1, 1992, the Company is due $5,000,000 per annum of additional rent from
Stop & Shop which was allocated to certain of Bradlees former
locations.  On December 31, 2002,
prior to the expiration of the leases to which the additional rent was allocated,
the Company reallocated this rent to other former Bradlees leases also
guaranteed by Stop & Shop.  Stop
& Shop is contesting the Company’s right to reallocate and claims the
Company is no longer entitled to the additional rent.  At December 31, 2005, the Company is due an
aggregate of $15,300,000.  The Company
believes the additional rent provision of the guaranty expires at the earliest
in 2012 and is vigorously contesting Stop & Shop’s position.

As lessee:

The Company is a tenant under operating leases for
certain properties. These leases have terms that expire during the next thirty
years.  Future minimum lease payments
under operating leases at December 31, 2005, are as follows:

Rent
expense was $22,146,000, $21,334,000, and $15,593,000 for the years ended

December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively

.

The Company is also a lessee under capital leases for
equipment and real estate (primarily Americold).  Lease terms generally range from 5-20 years
with renewal or purchase options. 
Capitalized leases are recorded at the present value of future minimum
lease payments or the fair market value of the property.  Capitalized leases are depreciated on a
straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset or life of the related
lease, whichever is shorter.  Amortization
expense on capital leases is included in “depreciation and amortization” on the
Company’s consolidated statements of income. 
As of December 31, 2005, future minimum lease payments under capital
leases are as follows:

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, $48,329,000 and
$54,261,000 representing the present value of net minimum payments is included
in “Other Liabilities” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.  At December 31, 2005 and 2004, property
leased under capital leases had a total cost of $66,483,000 and $64,974,000 and
related accumulated depreciation of $17,066,000 and $11,495,000, respectively.

Commitments
and Contingencies

At December 31, 2005, the Company’s $600,000,000
revolving credit facility, which expires in July 2006, had a zero outstanding
balance and $22,311,000 was reserved for outstanding letters of credit. This
facility contains financial covenants, which require the Company to maintain
minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization, and
provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in the Company’s
ratings below Baa3/BBB.  At December 31,
2005, Americold’s $30,000,000 revolving credit facility had a $9,076,000
outstanding balance and $17,000,000 was reserved for outstanding letters of
credit.

This facility requires Americold to maintain,
on a trailing four-quarter basis, a minimum of $30,000,000 of free cash flow, as
defined.  Both of these

facilities
contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations
and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give
rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest
or principal.

The Company has made acquisitions and investments in
partially-owned entities for which it is committed to fund additional capital
aggregating $40,800,000.  Of this amount,
$25,000,000 relates to capital

expenditures to be funded over the next six years at the
Springfield Mall, in which it has a 97.5% interest.

In addition to the above, o

n
November 10, 2005, the Company committed to fund the junior portion of up to
$30,530,000 of a $173,000,000 construction loan to an entity developing a
mix-use building complex in Boston, Massachusetts, at the north end of the
Boston Harbor.  The Company will earn
current-pay interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 11%. 
The loan will mature in November 2008, with a one-year extension
option.  The Company anticipates funding
all or portions of the loan beginning in 2006.

The Company carries comprehensive liability and all
risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) “acts
of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005
which expires in 2007 and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to its
assets.  Below is a summary of the
current all risk property insurance and terrorism risk insurance in effect through
September 2006 for each of the following business segments:

The Company’s debt instruments, consisting of mortgage
loans secured by its properties (which are generally non-recourse to the
Company), its senior unsecured notes due 2007, 2009 and 2010, its exchangeable
senior debentures due 2025 and its revolving credit agreements, contain
customary covenants requiring the Company to maintain insurance.  Although the Company believes that it has
adequate insurance coverage under these agreements, the Company may not be able
to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the
future.  Further, if lenders insist on
greater coverage than the Company is able to obtain, or if the Terrorism Risk
Insurance Extension Act of 2005 is not extended past 2007, it could adversely affect
the Company’s ability to finance and/or refinance its properties and expand its
portfolio.

Each of the Company’s properties has been subjected to
varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental
assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However,
there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of
contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the
discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not
result in significant costs to the Company.

On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a
complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
(“USDC-NJ”) claiming the Company has no right to reallocate and therefore continue
to collect $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the
Master Agreement and Guaranty.  On May
17, 2005, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment.  On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed the
Company’s motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.  On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its
decision denying the motions for summary judgment.  The Company intends to pursue its claims
against Stop & Shop vigorously. 
There are various other legal actions against the Company in the
ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, after consultation
with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect
on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

The Company enters into agreements for the purchase
and resale of U.S. government obligations for periods of up to one week. The
obligations purchased under these agreements are held in safekeeping in the
name of the Company by various money center banks. The Company has the right to
demand additional collateral or return of these invested funds at any time the
collateral value is less than 102% of the invested funds plus any accrued
earnings thereon.  The Company had
$177,650,000 and $23,110,000 of cash invested in these agreements at December
31, 2005 and 2004.

From time to time, the Company has disposed of
substantial amounts of real estate to third parties for which, as to certain
properties, it remains contingently liable for rent payments or mortgage
indebtedness that cannot be quantified by the Company.

Loan and Compensation
Agreements

On December 22, 2005, Steven Roth, the Company’s Chief
Executive Officer, repaid to the Company his $13,122,500 outstanding loan which
was scheduled to mature in January 2006. 
Pursuant to a credit agreement dated November 1999, Mr. Roth may draw up
to $15,000,000 of loans from the Company on a revolving basis.  Each loan bears interest, payable quarterly,
at the applicable Federal rate on the date the loan is made and matures on the
sixth anniversary of such loan.  Loans
are collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the amount
outstanding.  On December 23, 2005, Mr.
Roth borrowed $13,122,500 under this facility, which bears interest at 4.45%
per annum and matures on December 23, 2011.

At December 31, 2005, the balance of the loan due from
Michael Fascitelli, the Company’s President, in accordance with his employment
agreement was $8,600,000.  The loan
matures in December 2006 and bears interest, payable quarterly, at a
weighted average rate of 3.97% (based on the applicable Federal rate).

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company extended its
employment agreement with Mr. Fascitelli for a five-year period through
December 31, 2006.  Pursuant to the
extended employment agreement, Mr. Fascitelli is entitled to receive a deferred
payment on December 31, 2006 of 626,566 Vornado common shares which are valued
for compensation purposes at $27,500,000 (the value of the shares on March 8,
2002, the date the extended employment agreement was executed).  The shares are held in a rabbi trust for the
benefit of Mr. Fascitelli and vested 100% on December 31, 2002.  The extended employment agreement does not
permit diversification, allows settlement of the deferred compensation
obligation by delivery of these shares only, and permits the deferred delivery
of these shares.  The value of these
shares was amortized ratably over the one-year vesting period as compensation
expense.  The assets of the rabbi trust
are consolidated with those of the Company and the Company’s common shares held
in the trust are classified in shareholders’ equity and accounted for in a
manner similar to treasury stock.

Pursuant to the Company’s annual compensation review
in February 2002 with Joseph Macnow, the Company’s Chief Financial
Officer, the Compensation Committee approved a $2,000,000 loan to
Mr. Macnow, bearing interest at the applicable federal rate of 4.65% per
annum and due in June 2007.  The loan was
funded on July 23, 2002 and is collateralized by assets with a value of
not less than two times the loan amount.

On February 22, 2005, the Company and Sandeep
Mathrani, Executive Vice President – Retail Division, entered into a new
employment agreement.  Pursuant to the
agreement, the Company granted Mr. Mathrani (i) 16,836 restricted shares of the
Company’s stock, (ii) stock options to acquire 300,000 of the Company’s common
shares at an exercise price of $71.275 per share and (iii) the right to receive
200,000 stock options over the next two years at the then prevailing market
price.  In addition, Mr. Mathrani repaid
the $500,000 loan the Company provided him under his prior employment
agreement.

On March 11, 2004, the Company loaned $2,000,000 to
Melvyn Blum, an executive officer of the Company, pursuant to the revolving
credit facility contained in his January 2000 employment agreement.  Melvyn Blum resigned effective July 15,
2005.  In accordance with the terms of
his employment agreement, his $2,000,000 outstanding loan as of June 30, 2005
was repaid on August 14, 2005.

Alexander’s

The Company owns 33% of Alexander’s.  Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli are
officers and directors of Alexander’s. 
The Company provides various services to Alexander’s in accordance with
management, development and leasing agreements. 
See Note – 5 Investments in Partially-Owned Entities for details of
these agreements.

On December 29, 2005, Michael Fascitelli, the Company’s
President and President of Alexander’s, exercised 350,000 of his Alexander’s
stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) which were scheduled to expire in December
2006 and received $173.82 for each SAR exercised, representing the difference
between Alexander’s stock price of $247.70 (the average of the high and low
market price) on the date of exercise and the exercise price of $73.88.  This exercise was consistent with Alexander’s
tax planning.

On January 10, 2006, the Omnibus Stock Plan Committee
of the Board of Directors of Alexander’s granted Mr. Fascitelli a SAR covering
350,000 shares of Alexander’s common stock. 
The exercise price of the SAR is $243.83 per share of common stock,
which was the average of the high and low trading price of Alexander’s common
stock on date of grant and will become exercisable on July 10, 2006, provided
Mr. Fascitelli is employed with Alexander’s on such date, and will expire on
March 14, 2007.  Mr. Fascitelli’s early
exercise and Alexander’s related tax consequences were factors in Alexander’s
decision to make the new grant to him.

Interstate
Properties

As of December 31, 2005, Interstate Properties
and its partners owned approximately 9.2% of the common shares of beneficial
interest of the Company and 27.7% of Alexander’s common stock.  Interstate Properties is a general
partnership in which Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B.
Wight, Jr. are the partners. 
Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
of the Company, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties, and the
Chief Executive Officer and a director of Alexander’s.  Messrs. Mandelbaum and Wight are trustees of
the Company and also directors of Alexander’s.

The Company
manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate Properties pursuant to
a management agreement for which the Company receives an annual fee equal to 4%
of annual base rent and percentage rent. 
The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically
renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days’ notice at
the end of the term. Although the management agreement was not negotiated at
arm’s length, the Company believes based upon comparable fees charged by other
real estate companies that its terms are fair to the Company. The Company
earned $791,000, $726,000 and $703,000 of management fees under the management
agreement for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003.  In addition, during the fiscal year ended
2003, as a result of a previously existing leasing arrangement with Alexander’s,
Alexander’s paid to Interstate $587,000, for leasing and other services
actually rendered by the Company.  Upon
receipt of these payments, Interstate promptly paid them over to the Company
without retaining any interest therein. 
This arrangement was terminated at the end of 2003 and all payments by
Alexander’s thereafter for these leasing and other services are made directly
to the Company.

Vornado Operating
Company (“ Vornado Operating”)

In October 1998, Vornado Operating was spun off from
the Company in order to own assets that the Company could not itself own and
conduct activities that the Company could not itself conduct.  Vornado Operating’s primary asset was its 60%
investment in AmeriCold Logistics, which leased 88 refrigerated warehouses from
Americold, owned 60% by the Company.  On
November 4, 2004, Americold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for
$47,700,000 in cash.  As part of this
transaction, Vornado Operating repaid the $21,989,000 balance of its loan to
the Company as well as $4,771,000 of unpaid interest.  Because the Company fully reserved for the
interest income on this loan beginning in January 2002, it recognized $4,771,000
of income upon collection in the fourth quarter 2004.

In November 2004, a class action shareholder
derivative lawsuit was brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery against
Vornado Operating, its directors and the Company.  The lawsuit sought to enjoin the dissolution
of Vornado Operating, rescind the previously completed sale of AmeriCold
Logistics (owned 60% by Vornado Operating) to Americold (owned 60% by the
Company) and damages.  In addition, the
plaintiffs claimed that the Vornado Operating directors breached their
fiduciary duties.  On November 24, 2004,
a stipulation of settlement was entered into under which the Company agreed to
settle the lawsuit with a payment of approximately $4,500,000 or about $1 per
Vornado Operating share or partnership unit before litigation expenses. The Company
accrued the proposed settlement payment and related legal costs as part of “general
and administrative expense” in the fourth quarter of 2004.

On March 22, 2005, the Court approved the settlement.

company which provides cleaning and related services principally to the Company’s
Manhattan office properties, for $13,000,000 in cash from the estate of
Bernard Mendik and certain other individuals including David R. Greenbaum,
an executive officer of the Company.  The
Company paid BMS $53,024,000, for the year ended December 31, 2002 for
services rendered to the Company’s Manhattan office properties.  Although the terms and conditions of the
contracts pursuant to which these services were provided were not negotiated at
arms length, the Company believes based upon comparable amounts charged to
other real estate companies that the terms and conditions of the contracts were
fair to the Company.

On August 4, 2003, the Company completed the
acquisition of 2101 L Street, a 370,000 square foot office building located in
Washington D.C.  The consideration for
the acquisition consisted of approximately 1.1 million newly issued Operating
Partnership units (valued at approximately $49,517,000) and the assumption of
existing mortgage debt and transaction costs totaling approximately $32,000,000.  Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod,
trustees of Vornado, together with family members, owned approximately 24
percent of the limited partnership that sold the building and Mr. Smith was a
general partner.  On August 5, 2003,
the Company repaid the mortgage of $29,056,000.

On October 7, 2003, the Company acquired a 2.5%

Operating Partnership units valued at $626,000. 
The partnership units were issued to Mitchell N. Schear, one of the
partners in the Waterfront interest, and the President of the Company’s CESCR

price was $21,500,000.

On October 1, 2004, the Company increased its
ownership interest in the Investment Building in Washington, D.C. to 5% by
acquiring an additional 2.8% interest for $2,240,000 in cash.  The Company’s original interest in the
property was acquired in connection with the acquisition of the Kaempfer Company
in April 2003.  Mitchell N. Schear,
President of the Company’s CESCR division and other former members of Kaempfer
management were also partners in the Investment Building partnership.

On December 20, 2005, the

Segment
Information

The Company has

five business segments: Office, Retail, Merchandise Mart
Properties, Temperature Controlled Logistics and Toys “R” Us.  EBITDA represents “Earnings Before Interest,
Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.” 
Management considers EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions
and assessing the un-levered performance of its segments as it relates to the
total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity.  As properties are bought and sold based on a
multiple of EBITDA, management utilizes this measure to make investment
decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its
peers.  EBITDA should not be considered a
substitute for net income.  EBITDA may
not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

building, was 100% occupied by four tenants, of which Health Insurance Plan of
New York (“HIP”) and Fairchild Publications occupied 255,000 and 146,000 square
feet, respectively.  Effective January 4,

HIP made an initial payment of $13,362 and is anticipated to make annual
payments ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 over the remaining six years of the HIP
lease contingent upon the level of operating expenses of the building in each
year. In connection with the termination of the HIP lease, the Company wrote
off the $2,462 balance of the HIP receivable arising from the straight-lining
of rent.  In the first quarter of 2005,
the Company began redevelopment of a portion of this property into a permanent
showroom building for the giftware industry. 
As of January 1, 2005, the Company transferred the operations and
financial results related to the office component of this asset from the New
York City Office division to the Merchandise Mart division for both the current

presented.

Controls
and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures:  The Company’s management, with the
participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 (e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period
covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. 
Based on such evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:  There have not been any changes in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to which this report relates that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

Management of Vornado Realty Trust, together with its
consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”), is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  The Company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s
principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of the Company’s financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As of December 31, 2005, management conducted an
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Based on this assessment, management has
determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 is effective.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes
policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions
of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the trustees
of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s
assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has
been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 180, which expresses
unqualified opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board of
Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We have audited
management’s assessment, included within this December 31, 2005 Form 10-K of
Vornado Realty Trust at Item 9A in the accompanying “Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,” that Vornado Realty Trust, together
with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.  Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s
board of trustees, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.  A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent
limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis.  Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion,
management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 of the Company and our
report dated February 28, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements and financial statement schedules.
