Part III

: 
Portions of Proxy Statement for Annual Meeting of Vornado Realty Trust’s
Shareholders to be held on May 18, 2017.

This Annual
Report on Form 10-K omits financial statements required under Rule 3-09 of
Regulation S-X, for Toys “R” Us, Inc. An amendment to this Annual Report on
Form 10-K will be filed as soon as practicable following the availability of
such financial statements.

EXPLANATORY NOTE

This report combines the Annual
Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 of Vornado
Realty Trust and Vornado Realty L.P.  Unless stated otherwise or the context
otherwise requires, references to
“Vornado” refer to
Vornado Realty Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”), and
references to the “Operating Partnership” refer to Vornado Realty L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership. References to the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”
mean collectively Vornado, the Operating Partnership and those
entities/subsidiaries consolidated by Vornado.

The Operating Partnership is the
entity through which we conduct substantially all of our business and own,
either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of our assets. Vornado
is the sole general partner and also a 93.7% limited partner of the Operating
Partnership.  As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, Vornado
has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership’s day-to-day management.

Under the limited partnership
agreement of the Operating Partnership, unitholders may present their Class A
units for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the
time of issuance of the units that may restrict such right for a period of time).
Class A units may be
tendered for redemption to the Operating Partnership for cash; Vornado, at its
option, may assume that obligation and pay the holder either cash or Vornado
common shares on a one-for-one basis.  Because the number of Vornado common
shares outstanding at all times equals the number of Class A units owned by
Vornado, the redemption value of each Class A unit is equivalent to the market
value of one Vornado common share, and the quarterly distribution to a Class A
unitholder is equal to the quarterly dividend paid to a Vornado common
shareholder.  This
one-for-one exchange ratio is subject to specified adjustments to prevent
dilution. Vornado generally expects that it will elect to issue its common
shares in connection with each such presentation for redemption rather than
having the Operating Partnership pay cash. With each such exchange or
redemption, Vornado’s percentage ownership in the Operating Partnership will
increase. In addition, whenever Vornado issues common shares other than to
acquire Class A units of the Operating Partnership, Vornado must contribute any
net proceeds it receives to the Operating Partnership and the Operating
Partnership must issue to Vornado an equivalent number of Class A units of the
Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella
partnership REIT, or UPREIT.

The Company believes that
combining the Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Vornado and the Operating
Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:

•

enhances
  investors’ understanding of Vornado and the Operating Partnership by enabling
  investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management
  views and operates the business;

•

eliminates
  duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable
  presentation because a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both Vornado
  and the Operating Partnership; and

•

creates
  time and cost efficiencies in the preparation of one combined report instead
  of two separate reports.

The Company believes it is
important to understand the few differences between Vornado and the Operating
Partnership in the context of how Vornado and the Operating Partnership operate
as a consolidated company. The financial results of the Operating Partnership
are consolidated into the financial statements of Vornado. Vornado does not
have any other significant assets, liabilities or operations, other than its
investment in the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership, not Vornado,
generally executes all significant business relationships other than
transactions involving the securities of Vornado. The Operating Partnership
holds substantially all of the assets of Vornado. The Operating Partnership
conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with
no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity offerings by
Vornado, which are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in
exchange for Class A units of partnership in the Operating Partnership, as
applicable, the Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required
by the Company’s business. These capital sources may include working capital,
net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under the revolving
credit facility, the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity
securities and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties.

To
help investors better understand the key differences between Vornado and the
Operating Partnership, certain information for Vornado and the Operating
Partnership in this report has been separated, as set forth below:

This report also includes
separate Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures sections, separate Exhibit
12 computation of ratios, and separate Exhibits 31 and 32 certifications for
each of Vornado and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the
requisite certifications have been made and that Vornado and the Operating
Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and 18 U.S.C. §1350.

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements contained herein constitute forward‑looking
statements as such term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.
They represent our intentions, plans, expectations and beliefs and are subject
to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Our future results, financial
condition and business may differ materially from those expressed in these
forward-looking statements. You can find many of these statements by looking
for words such as “approximates,” “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,”
“estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “would,” “may” or other similar expressions in
this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. We also note the following
forward-looking statements: in the case of our development and redevelopment projects,
the estimated completion date, estimated project cost and cost to complete; and
estimates of future capital expenditures, dividends to common and preferred
shareholders and operating partnership distributions. Many of the factors that
will determine the outcome of these and our other forward-looking statements
are beyond our ability to control or predict. For further discussion of factors
that could materially affect the outcome of our forward-looking statements, see
“Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe
harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K or the date of any document incorporated by reference.
All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us
or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by
the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. We do not
undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to our
forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after
the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


PART I

ITEM 1.        BUSINESS

Vornado is a
fully‑integrated REIT and conducts its business through, and
substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, the Operating
Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership.  Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow
and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent upon the cash
flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect
subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors.  Vornado is the
sole general partner of, and owned approximately 93.7% of the common limited
partnership interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2016.

On October
31, 2016, Vornado’s Board of Trustees approved the tax-free spin-off of our
Washington, DC segment and we entered into a definitive agreement to merge it
with the business and certain select assets of The JBG Companies (“JBG”), a
Washington, DC real estate company.  Steven Roth, the Chairman of the Board of
Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado, will be Chairman of the Board
of Trustees of the new company, which will be named JBG SMITH Properties. 
Mitchell Schear, President of our Washington, DC business, will be a member of
the Board of Trustees of the new company.  The pro rata distribution to Vornado
common shareholders and Class A Operating Partnership unitholders is intended
to be treated as a tax-free spin-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It
is expected to be made on a pro rata

1:2

basis.  The initial Form 10 registration statement relating to the spin-off and
merger was filed with the SEC on January 23, 2017 and the distribution and
combination are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017. The
distribution and combination are subject to certain conditions, including the
SEC declaring the Form 10 registration statement effective, filing and approval
of the new company’s listing application, receipt of regulatory approvals and
third party consents by each of the Company and JBG, and formal declaration of
the distribution by Vornado’s Board of Trustees. The distribution and
combination are not subject to a vote by Vornado’s shareholders or Operating
Partnership unitholders. Vornado’s Board of Trustees has approved the
transaction.  JBG has obtained all requisite approvals from its investment
funds for this transaction.  There can be no assurance that this transaction
will be completed.

OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY

Our business
objective is to maximize Vornado shareholder value. We intend to achieve this
objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and execute our
operating strategies through:

·

maintaining a
superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial
spirit;

·

investing in properties
in select markets, such as New York City, where we believe there is a high
likelihood of capital appreciation;

·

acquiring
quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a
significant potential for higher rents;

·

investing in
retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City
metropolitan area;

·

developing and
redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value;
and

·

investing
in operating companies that have a significant real estate component.

We expect to
finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated
funds, proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private
capital markets.  We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or
Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or
otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

ACQUISITIONS

There were no
significant acquisitions during 2016.

DISPOSITIONS

On May 27,
2016, we sold a 47% ownership interest in 7 West 34th Street for net proceeds of
$127.4 million.

On
August 24, 2016, the Skyline properties, located in Fairfax, Virginia, were
placed in receivership.  On December 21, 2016, the final disposition of the
Skyline properties

was completed by the receiver.  In
connection therewith, the Skyline properties’ assets (approximately $236.5
million) and liabilities (approximately $724.4 million), were removed from our
consolidated balance sheet which resulted in a net gain of $487.9 million. 
There was no taxable income related to this transaction.

On
December 19, 2016, we sold a 20% ownership interest in Fairfax Square for $15.5
million.

FINANCINGS

We completed
the following financing transactions during 2016:

·

$900 million refinancing of 280 Park Avenue (50% owned);

·

$700 million refinancing of 770 Broadway for net proceeds of approximately
$330 million;

·

$675 million refinancing of theMART for net proceeds of approximately

cumulative redeemable preferred shares

We also
extended one of our two $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities to
February 2021 with two six-month extension options, lowering the interest rate
from LIBOR plus 115 basis points to LIBOR plus 100 basis points.  The facility
fee remains unchanged at 20 basis points.


DEVELOPMENT
AND REDEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES

We are constructing a residential condominium tower containing
397,000 salable square feet on our 220 Central Park South development site. The
incremental development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately
$1.3 billion, of which $609,420,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2016.

We are developing a 173,000 square foot Class-A office
building at 512 West 22nd Street, along the western edge of the High Line in
the West Chelsea submarket of Manhattan (55.0% owned).  The incremental
development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $130,000,000,
of which our share is $72,000,000.  As of December 31, 2016, $30,143,000 has
been expended, of which our share is $16,579,000.

We are developing a 170,000 square foot office and retail
building at 61 Ninth Avenue, located on the southwest corner of Ninth Avenue
and 15th Street in the West Chelsea submarket of Manhattan.  In February 2016,
the venture purchased an adjacent five story loft building and air rights in
exchange for a 10% common and preferred equity interest in the venture valued
at $19,400,000, which reduced our ownership interest to 45.1% from 50.1%.  On
December 21, 2016, the venture obtained a $90,000,000 construction loan. The
loan matures in December 2020 with two six-month extension options. The
interest rate is LIBOR plus 3.05%. As of December 31, 2016, there was nothing
drawn on this loan. The incremental development cost of this project is
estimated to be approximately $150,000,000, of which our share is $68,000,000. 
As of December 31, 2016, $38,499,000 has been expended, of which our share is
$17,363,000.

We are developing a 34,000 square foot office and retail building
at 606 Broadway, located on the northeast corner of Broadway and Houston Street
in Manhattan (50.0% owned).   At closing, the joint venture obtained a
$65,000,000 construction loan, of which approximately $25,800,000 was
outstanding as of December 31, 2016. The loan, which bears interest at LIBOR
plus 3.00% (3.66% at December 31, 2016), matures in May 2019 with two one-year
extension options. The venture’s incremental development cost of this project
is estimated to be approximately $60,000,000, of which our share is
$30,000,000. As of

December 31, 2016

, $20,833,000 has been expended, of which our share is
$10,417,000.

We are in the process of demolishing
two adjacent Washington, DC office properties, 1726 M Street and 1150 17th
Street, and will replace them in the future with a new 335,000 square foot
Class A office building, to be addressed 1700 M Street.  The incremental
development cost of the project is estimated to be approximately $170,000,000,
of which $10,500,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2016.

In September 2016, a joint
venture between the Related Companies and Vornado was designated by New York
State to redevelop the historic Farley Post Office building. The building will
include a new Moynihan Train Hall and approximately 850,000 rentable square
feet of office space and ancillary train hall retail.  The joint venture will
enter into a 99-year, triple-net lease and make a $230,000,000 contribution
towards the construction of the train hall.  Total costs for the redevelopment
of the office and retail space are yet to be determined.

We are also evaluating other
development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in
Manhattan, including, in particular, the Penn Plaza District.

There can be no assurance that any of our development or
redevelopment projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed, or
completed on schedule or within budget.


SEGMENT DATA

We operate in the following business segments: New York and
Washington, DC.  Financial information related to these business segments for
the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is set forth in Note 23 –

Segment
Information

to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

SEASONALITY

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during
the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from
operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the current quarter to the
previous quarter.  The New York and Washington, DC segments have historically
experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year.

tenants ACCOUNTING FOR over 10% of
revenues

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total
revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014

.

Certain Activities

We do not base our acquisitions and investments on specific
allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for
long‑term investment; however, it is possible that properties in our
portfolio may be sold when circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted
a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested
in a specific property or property type. While we may seek the vote of our
shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally
our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by Vornado’s
Board of Trustees without the vote of our shareholders or Operating Partnership
unitholders.

Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we have approximately 4,225
employees, of which 284 are corporate staff. The New York segment has 3,265
employees, including 2,634 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a
wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering
services primarily to our New York and Washington, DC properties and 459
employees at the Hotel Pennsylvania. The Washington, DC segment and theMART
properties have 456 and 220 employees, respectively.  The foregoing does not
include employees of partially owned entities.

principal executive offices

Our principal executive offices are located at 888 Seventh
Avenue, New York, New York 10019; telephone (212) 894‑7000.

ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS

Material factors that may adversely
affect our business, operations and financial condition are summarized below. 
We refer to the equity and debt securities of both Vornado and the Operating
Partnership as our “securities” and the investors who own shares or units, or both,
as our “equity holders.” The risks and uncertainties described herein may not
be the only ones we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently
known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely
affect our business.  See “Forward-Looking Statements” contained herein on page
6.

Real
Estate Investments’ Value and Income Fluctuate Due to Various Factors.

The value of real estate fluctuates
depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business.
These conditions may also adversely impact our revenues and cash flows.

global,
national, regional and local economic conditions;

·

competition
from other available space;

·

local
conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real
estate in the area;

·

how
well we manage our properties;

·

the development and/or redevelopment of our properties;

·

changes
in market rental rates;

·

the
timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;

·

whether
we are able to pass all or portions of any increases in operating costs through
to tenants;

changes
in real estate taxes and other expenses;

·

whether
tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property
attractive;

·

changes in space utilization by our tenants due to technology,
economic conditions and business environment;

·

the
financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies
or defaults;

·

availability
of financing on acceptable terms or at all;

·

inflation or deflation;

·

ability to obtain adequate insurance;

·

in zoning laws and taxation;

·

States or individual acts of violence in public spaces including retail
centers;

·

potential
liability under environmental or other laws or regulations;

·

natural disasters;

·

general
competitive factors; and

·

climate changes.

The rents or sales proceeds we receive and
the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse
changes in any of these factors. If rental revenues, sales proceeds and/or
occupancy levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available
to pay indebtedness and for distribution to equity holders. In addition, some
of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and
maintenance costs generally do not decline when the related rents decline.

Capital
markets and economic conditions can materially affect our liquidity, financial
condition and results of operations as well as the value of our debt and equity
securities.

There are many factors that can affect the value
of our debt and equity securities, including the state of the capital markets
and the economy.  Demand for office and retail space may decline nationwide, as
it did in 2008 and 2009 due to the economic downturn, bankruptcies, downsizing,
layoffs and cost cutting.  Government action or inaction may adversely affect
the state of the capital markets.  The cost and availability of credit may be
adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads, which
may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our
results of operations, and the liquidity and financial condition of our
tenants.  Our inability or the inability of our tenants to timely refinance
maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs may
materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the
value of our securities.


Real
estate is a competitive business.

We compete with a large number of real
estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept
lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents
charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property
and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon,
among other factors, trends of the global, national, regional and local
economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and
prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital,
construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations,
legislation, population and employment trends.

We depend on leasing
space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from
tenants who may not be able to pay.

Our financial results depend
significantly on leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically
favorable terms. In addition, because a majority of our income comes from
renting of real property, our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and
funds available for distribution to equity holders will decrease if a
significant number of our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able
to maintain occupancy levels on favorable terms. If a tenant does not pay its
rent, we may not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and
may incur substantial legal costs.  During periods of economic adversity, there
may be an increase in the number of tenants that cannot pay their rent and an
increase in vacancy rates.

We may be unable to
renew leases or relet space as leases expire.

When our tenants decide not to renew
their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even
if tenants do renew or we can relet the space, the terms of renewal or reletting,
taking into account among other things, the cost of improvements to the
property and leasing commissions, may be less favorable than the terms in the
expired leases. In addition, changes in space utilization by our tenants may
impact our ability to renew or relet space without the need to incur
substantial costs in renovating or redesigning the internal configuration of
the relevant property. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet
the space at similar rates or if we incur substantial costs in renewing or
reletting the space, our cash flow and ability to service debt obligations and
pay dividends and distributions to equity holders could be adversely affected.

Bankruptcy or
insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenue, net income and available cash.

From time to time, some of our tenants
have declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become
insolvent in the future. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could
cause us to suffer lower revenues and operational difficulties, including
leasing the remainder of the property. As a result, the bankruptcy or
insolvency of a major tenant could result in decreased revenue, net income and
funds available to pay our indebtedness or make distributions to equity holders.

We
may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and environmental
contamination may impair our ability to lease and/or sell real estate.

Our operations and properties are subject
to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the
protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or
toxic substances and health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a
current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to
investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property.
The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to
third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation
and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination.
These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or
operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. The
presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may impair
our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as
collateral. Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality
including those that can require the abatement or removal of
asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or
remodeling and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the
air. The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment
containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are also regulated by federal and
state laws. We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to
chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and
bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to
allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. Our
predecessor companies may be subject to similar liabilities for activities of
those companies in the past.  We could incur fines for environmental compliance
and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the
foregoing regulated substances or related claims arising out of environmental
contamination or human exposure to contamination at or from our properties.

Each of our properties has been subject
to varying degrees of environmental assessment. To date, these environmental
assessments have not revealed any environmental condition material to our
business. However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered
areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination,
human exposure to contamination or changes in clean-up or compliance
requirements could result in significant costs to us.


In addition, we
may become subject to costs or taxes, or increases therein, associated with
natural resource or energy usage (such as a “carbon tax”).  These costs or
taxes could increase our operating costs and decrease the cash available to pay
our obligations or distribute to equity holders.

We
face risks associated with our tenants being designated “Prohibited Persons” by
the Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar requirements.

Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws, the Office of Foreign
Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”)
maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise
blocked or banned (“Prohibited Persons”) from conducting business or engaging
in transactions in the United States and thereby restricts our doing business
with such persons.  In addition, our leases, loans and other agreements

may require us to comply with OFAC and related
requirements, and any failure to do so may result in a breach of
such agreements

. 
If a tenant or other party with whom we conduct business is placed on the OFAC
list or is otherwise a party with whom we are prohibited from doing business,
we may be required to terminate the lease or other agreement.  Any such
termination could result in a loss of revenue or otherwise negatively affect
our financial results and cash flows.

Our
business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.

Despite system redundancy, the
implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery
plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems are
vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses,
unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and
telecommunication failures.  Any system failure or accident that causes
interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our
business.  We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such
disruptions.

The
occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cyber security, could
negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a
compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our
business relationships or reputation, all of which could negatively impact our
financial results.

We face risks associated with
security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the
Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons who access
our systems from inside or outside our organization, and other significant
disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security
breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion,
including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has
generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted
attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our
IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our
business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing
our building systems) and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of
certain of our tenants. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and
integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have
implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or
disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures
will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not
be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks,
systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques
used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not
recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed to
not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be
unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security
barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to
entirely mitigate this risk.

A security breach or other
significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could
disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our
operations and/or those of certain of our tenants; result in the unauthorized
access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of,
proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours
or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose
us to damage claims by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise
harmful purposes and outcomes; result in our inability to maintain the building
systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space;
require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages
that result; subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits,
penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our
reputation among our tenants and investors generally. Any or all of the
foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.


Some
of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.

We maintain general liability
insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, and all
risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per
occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as flood and earthquake.
Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of
$180,000,000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate, subject to a
deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. We
maintain coverage for terrorism acts with limits of $4.0 billion per occurrence
and in the aggregate, and $2.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for
terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”)
terrorism events, as defined by Terrorism Risk Insurance Program
Reauthorization Act of 2015, which expires in December 2020.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC
(“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with
respect to a portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a
portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for
coverage for acts of terrorism including NBCR acts. Coverage for acts of
terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance
companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. For NBCR acts,
PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $1,622,000 ($1,976,000 for 2017) and
16% (17% for 2017) of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government
is responsible for the remaining portion of a covered loss. We are ultimately
responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the
insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism. 
However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially
reasonable terms in the future.

Our debt
instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are
non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements
contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we
believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements,
we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable
costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are
able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our properties
and expand our portfolio.

Compliance
or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety
regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.

The Americans with Disabilities Act
(“ADA”) generally requires that public buildings, including our properties,
meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled
persons.  Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal
government or the award of damages to private litigants and/or legal fees to their
counsel.  From time to time persons have asserted claims against us with
respect to some of our properties under the ADA, but to date such claims have
not resulted in any material expense or liability.  If, under the ADA, we are
required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or
more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as
the amount of cash available for distribution to equity holders.

Our properties are subject to various
federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire
and life safety requirements.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we
could incur fines or private damage awards.  We do not know whether existing
requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will
require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow
and results of operations.


OUR INVESTMENTS ARE
CONCENTRATED CURRENTLY IN THE NEW YORK CITY METROPOLITAN AREA AND WASHINGTON,
DC/NORTHERN VIRGINIA AREA AND CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING THESE AREAS GENERALLY
COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.  UPON COMPLETION OF OUR PROPOSED SPIN-OFF
OF OUR WASHINGTON, DC SEGMENT, OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTMENTS WILL BE LESS
DIVERSIFIED AND MORE CONCENTRATED IN THE NEW YORK CITY METROPOLITAN AREA.

A
significant portion of our properties are located currently in the New York
City/New Jersey metropolitan area and Washington, DC/Northern Virginia area and
are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent to those areas.

In 2016, approximately 91% of our EBITDA, as
adjusted, came from properties located in the New York City metropolitan area
and the Washington, DC/Northern Virginia area.  We may continue to concentrate
a significant portion of our future acquisitions in these areas or in other
geographic real estate markets in the United States or abroad.  Real estate
markets are subject to economic downturns and we cannot predict how economic
conditions will impact these markets in either the short or long term. Declines
in the economy or declines in real estate markets in these areas could hurt our
financial performance and the value of our properties.  In addition to the
factors affecting the national economic condition generally, the factors
affecting economic conditions in these regions include:

·

financial performance and productivity
of the media, advertising, financial, technology, retail, insurance and real
estate industries;

·

with respect to our Washington, DC
segment, space needs of, and budgetary constraints affecting, the United States
Government, including the effect of a deficit reduction plan and/or base
closures and repositioning under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act
of 2005, as amended;

·

business layoffs or downsizing;

·

industry slowdowns;

·

relocations of businesses;

·

changing demographics;

·

increased telecommuting and use of
alternative work places;

·

changes in the number of domestic and international tourists to
our markets (including, as a result of changes in the relative strengths of
world currencies);

·

infrastructure quality; and

·

any oversupply of, or reduced demand
for, real estate.

Assuming we complete the spin-off of our
Washington, DC segment as expected, our real estate investments will be more
concentrated in New York City and less diversified than prior to the
spin-off.   After giving effect to the spin-off and assuming it was completed
as of January 1, 2016, 89% of our EBITDA, as adjusted, came from properties
located in the New York City metropolitan area.

It is impossible for us to assess the
future effects of trends in the economic and investment climates of the
geographic areas in which we concentrate, and more generally of the United States,
or the real estate markets in these areas.  Local, national or global economic
downturns, would negatively affect our businesses and profitability.

Terrorist
attacks, such as those of September 11, 2001 in New York City and the
Washington, DC area, may adversely affect the value of our properties and our
ability to generate cash flow.

We have significant investments in large
metropolitan areas, including the New York, Washington, DC, Chicago and San
Francisco metropolitan areas. In response to a terrorist attack or the
perceived threat of terrorism, tenants in these areas may choose to relocate
their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States
that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity and
fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in these areas. This, in
turn, would trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these areas, which
could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease space on less
favorable terms. As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our
revenues and cash flows could decline materially.

Natural
disasters and the effects of climate change could have a concentrated impact on
the areas where we operate and could adversely impact our results.

Our investments are concentrated in the New York,
Washington, DC, Chicago and San Francisco metropolitan areas.  Natural
disasters, including earthquakes, storms and hurricanes, could impact our
properties in these and other areas in which we operate.  Potentially adverse
consequences of “global warming” could similarly have an impact on our
properties.  As a result, we could become subject to significant losses and/or
repair costs that may or may not be fully covered by insurance and to the risk
of business interruption.  The incurrence of these losses, costs or business
interruptions may adversely affect our operating and financial results.


We
May Acquire or Sell Assets or Entities or Develop Properties. Our Failure
or Inability to Consummate These Transactions or Manage the Results of These
Transactions Could Adversely Affect Our Operations and Financial Results.

We
may acquire, develop or redevelop real estate and acquire related companies and
this may create risks.

We may acquire, develop or redevelop
properties or acquire real estate related companies when we believe doing so is
consistent with our business strategy. We may not succeed in (i) developing,
redeveloping or acquiring real estate and real estate related companies; (ii)
completing these activities on time or within budget; and (iii) leasing or
selling developed, redeveloped or acquired properties at amounts sufficient to
cover our costs.  Competition in these activities could also significantly
increase our costs. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly
or time-consuming and could divert management’s attention. Acquisitions or
developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level
of market knowledge may result in weaker than anticipated performance. We may
also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that we have begun
pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred. 
Furthermore, we may be exposed to the liabilities of properties or companies
acquired, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition.

From time
to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, one or more
material acquisitions.  The announcement of such a material acquisition may
result in a rapid and significant decline in the price of our securities.

We are continuously looking at material
transactions that we believe will maximize shareholder value.  However, an
announcement by us of one or more significant acquisitions could result in a
quick and significant decline in the price of our securities.

It may be difficult
to buy and sell real estate quickly, which may limit our flexibility.

Real estate investments are relatively
difficult to buy and sell quickly. Consequently, we may have limited ability to
vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other
conditions.

We
may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the debt
associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so
without incurring additional costs.  In addition, when we dispose of or sell
assets, we may not be able to reinvest the sales proceeds and earn similar
returns.

As part of an acquisition of a property, or a
portfolio of properties, we may agree, and in the past have agreed, not to
dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness for a
long-term period, unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the
seller. These agreements could result in us holding on to properties that we
would otherwise sell and not pay down or refinance.  In addition, when we
dispose of or sell assets, we may not be able to reinvest the sales proceeds
and earn returns similar to those generated by the assets that were sold.

From
time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, investments
in companies over which we do not have sole control. Some of these companies
operate in industries with different risks than investing and operating real
estate.

From time to time we have made, and in the future
we may seek to make, investments in companies that we may not control,
including, but not limited to, Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”),
Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”), Lexington Realty Trust (“Lexington”), Urban Edge
Properties (“UE”), Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (“PREIT”), and
other equity and loan investments. Although these businesses generally have a
significant real estate component, some of them operate in businesses that are
different from investing and operating real estate, including operating or
managing toy stores. Consequently, we are subject to operating and financial
risks of those industries and to the risks associated with lack of control,
such as having differing objectives than our partners or the entities in which
we invest, or becoming involved in disputes, or competing directly or
indirectly with these partners or entities.  In addition, we rely on the
internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their
failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may
adversely affect us.

We
are subject to risks that affect the general and New York City retail
environments.

Certain of our properties are Manhattan street
retail properties.  As such, these properties are affected by the general and
New York City retail environments, including the level of consumer spending and
consumer confidence, change in relative strengths of world currencies, the
threat of terrorism, increasing competition from retailers, outlet malls,
retail websites and catalog companies and the impact of technological change
upon the retail environment generally.  These factors could adversely affect
the financial condition of our retail tenants and the willingness of retailers
to lease space in our retail locations, and in turn, adversely affect us.


Our investment in Toys has in the past and may in the
future result in increased seasonality and volatility in our reported earnings.

We carry our Toys investment at zero.  As a result, we
no longer record our equity in Toys' income or loss.   Because Toys
is a retailer, its operations subject us to the risks of a retail company that
are different than those presented by our other lines of business. The business
of Toys is highly seasonal and substantially all of Toys net income is generated
in its fourth quarter.  It is possible that the value of Toys may increase and
we could again resume recording our equity in Toys' income or loss, which would
increase the seasonality and volatility of our reported earnings.

Our
decision to dispose of real estate assets would change the holding period
assumption in our valuation analyses, which could result in material impairment
losses and adversely affect our financial results.

We evaluate real
estate assets for impairment based on the projected cash flow of the asset over
our anticipated holding period.  If we change our intended holding period, due
to our intention to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset, then under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we
must reevaluate whether that asset is impaired.  Depending on the carrying
value of the property at the time we change our intention and the amount that
we estimate we would receive on disposal, we may record an impairment loss that
would adversely affect our financial results. This loss could be material to
our results of operations in the period that it is recognized.

We
invest in marketable equity securities.  The value of these investments may
decline as a result of operating performance or economic or market conditions.

We invest in marketable equity securities
of publicly-traded companies, such as Lexington.  As of December 31, 2016, our
marketable securities have an aggregate carrying amount of $203,704,000, at
market.  Significant declines in the value of these investments due to, among
other reasons, operating performance or economic or market conditions, may
result in the recognition of impairment losses which could be material.

We
may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve
from the spin-off.

Although we believe that separating our Washington, DC segment
will provide benefits to us and our shareholders, the spin-off may not provide
such results on the scope or scale we anticipate, and neither we nor JBG SMITH
may realize the intended benefits of the spin-off.  In addition, we will incur
one-time costs in connection with the spin-off that may exceed our estimates
and negate some of the benefits we expect to achieve.  Further, if the proposed
spin-off is completed, our operational and financial profile will change upon
the separation of the Washington, DC segment from us. As a result, our
diversification of revenue sources will diminish, and our results of
operations, cash flows, working capital, and financing requirements may be
subject to increased volatility.


Our Organizational and
Financial Structure Gives Rise to Operational and Financial Risks.

We may not be
able to obtain capital to make investments.

We depend primarily on external financing
to fund the growth of our business. This is because one of the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for a REIT is that it
distributes 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its
shareholders. This, in turn, requires the Operating Partnership to make
distributions to its unitholders. There is a separate requirement to distribute
net capital gains or pay a corporate level tax in lieu thereof. Our access to
debt or equity financing depends on the willingness of third parties to lend or
make equity investments and on conditions in the capital markets generally.
Although we believe that we will be able to finance any investments we may wish
to make in the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that new financing
will be available or available on acceptable terms. For information about our
available sources of funds, see

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital
Resources”

and the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We
depend on dividends and distributions from our direct and indirect
subsidiaries. The creditors and preferred equity holders of these subsidiaries
are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the
subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to us.

Substantially all of Vornado’s assets are
held through its Operating Partnership that holds substantially all of its
properties and assets through subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership’s cash
flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by its subsidiaries, and in turn,
substantially all of Vornado’s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to
it by the Operating Partnership. The creditors of each of Vornado’s direct and
indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations
to them, when due and payable, before distributions may be made by that
subsidiary to its equity holders. Thus, the Operating Partnership’s ability to
make distributions to its equity holders depends on its subsidiaries’ ability
first to satisfy their obligations to their creditors and then to make
distributions to the Operating Partnership. Likewise, Vornado’s ability to pay
dividends to its holders of common and preferred shares depends on the
Operating Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its
creditors and make distributions payable to holders of preferred units and then
to make distributions to Vornado.

Furthermore, the holders of preferred
units of the Operating Partnership are entitled to receive preferred
distributions before payment of distributions to the Operating Partnership’s equity
holders, including Vornado. Thus, Vornado’s ability to pay cash dividends to
its equity holders and satisfy its debt obligations depends on the Operating
Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and
make distributions to holders of its preferred units and then to its equity
holders, including Vornado.  As of December 31, 2016, there were four series of
preferred units of the Operating Partnership not held by Vornado with a total
liquidation value of $56,047,000.

In addition, Vornado’s participation in
any distribution of the assets of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries
upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency, is only after the claims of
the creditors, including trade creditors and preferred equity holders, are
satisfied.

We
have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could affect our future
operations.

As of December 31, 2016, our consolidated
mortgages and unsecured indebtedness, excluding related premium, discount and
deferred financing costs, net, totaled $10.7 billion. We are subject to
the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our
cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service.
Our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the
property, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants,
cause a reduction in the income from the property. Should such events occur,
our operations may be adversely affected. If a property is mortgaged to secure
payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay
that indebtedness, the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee
resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value.


We have outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its
cost may increase and refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.

We rely on both secured and unsecured,
variable rate and non-variable rate debt to finance acquisitions and
development activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt
financing or refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial
condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected.  In
addition, the cost of our existing debt may increase, especially in the case of
a rising interest rate environment, and we may not be able to refinance our
existing debt in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms.  If the cost or
amount of our indebtedness increases or we cannot refinance our debt in
sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, we are at risk of credit ratings
downgrades and default on our obligations that could adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations.

Covenants
in our debt instruments could adversely affect our financial condition and our
acquisitions and development activities.

The mortgages on our properties contain
customary covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior
consent of the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to
discontinue insurance coverage. Our unsecured indebtedness and debt that we may
obtain in the future may contain customary restrictions, requirements and other
limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including covenants that
limit our ability to incur debt based upon the level of our ratio of total debt
to total assets, our ratio of secured debt to total assets, our ratio of EBITDA
to interest expense, and fixed charges, and that require us to maintain a
certain level of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt. Our ability to borrow
is subject to compliance with these and other covenants. In addition, failure
to comply with our covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt
instrument, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from
other sources or give possession of a secured property to the lender. Under
those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or
may be available only on unattractive terms.

A downgrade in our
credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business and financial
condition.

Our credit rating and the credit ratings assigned
to our debt securities and our preferred shares could change based upon, among
other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings
are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and any rating
could be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its
judgment, circumstances warrant such action. Moreover, these credit ratings are
not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our common shares or any other
securities. If any of the credit rating agencies that have rated our securities
downgrades or lowers its credit rating, or if any credit rating agency
indicates that it has placed any such rating on a “watch list” for a possible
downgrading or lowering, or otherwise indicates that its outlook for that
rating is negative, such action could have a material adverse effect on our
costs and availability of funding, which could in turn have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the
trading/redemption price of our securities, and our ability to satisfy our debt
service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our equity
holders.

Vornado
may fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT and may be required to pay
income taxes at corporate rates.

Although we believe that Vornado will
remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for
federal income tax purposes, Vornado may fail to remain so qualified.
Qualifications are governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial or
administrative interpretations and depend on various facts and circumstances
that are not entirely within our control. In addition, legislation, new
regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may
significantly change the relevant tax laws and/or the federal income tax
consequences of qualifying as a REIT. If, with respect to any taxable year,
Vornado fails to maintain its qualification as a REIT and does not qualify
under statutory relief provisions, Vornado could not deduct distributions to
shareholders in computing our taxable income and would have to pay federal
income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. The federal income
tax payable would include any applicable alternative minimum tax. If Vornado
had to pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute to equity
holders and pay its indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years
involved, and Vornado would not be required to make distributions to shareholders
in that taxable year and in future years until it was able to qualify as a
REIT.  In addition, Vornado would also be disqualified from treatment as a
REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification
was lost, unless Vornado were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory
provisions.

We
face possible adverse changes in tax laws, which may result in an increase in
our tax liability.

From time to time changes in state and
local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in
our tax liability. The shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities
in recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such
changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on
our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available
for payment of dividends and distributions.


Loss of our key personnel could harm our operations and
adversely affect the value of our common shares and Operating Partnership Class
A units.

We are dependent on the efforts of Steven
Roth, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado. 
While we believe that we could find a replacement for him and other key
personnel, the loss of their services could harm our operations and adversely
affect the value of our securities.

Vornado’s charter
documents and applicable law may hinder any attempt to acquire us.

Vornado’s Amended
and Restated Declaration of Trust (the “declaration of trust”) sets limits on
the ownership of its shares.

Generally, for Vornado to maintain its
qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% in
value of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of Vornado may be owned,
directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the
last half of Vornado’s taxable year. The Internal Revenue Code defines
“individuals” for purposes of the requirement described in the preceding
sentence to include some types of entities. Under Vornado’s declaration of
trust, as amended, no person may own more than 6.7% of the outstanding common
shares of any class, or 9.9% of the outstanding preferred shares of any class,
with some exceptions for persons who held common shares in excess of the 6.7%
limit before Vornado adopted the limit and other persons approved by Vornado’s
Board of Trustees. These restrictions on transferability and ownership may
delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado or other transaction
that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of equity
holders.

The Maryland General Corporation
Law (the “MGCL”) contains provisions that may reduce the likelihood of certain
takeover transactions.

The MGCL imposes conditions and
restrictions on certain “business combinations” (including, among other
transactions, a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or, in certain
circumstances, an asset transfer or issuance of equity securities) between a
Maryland REIT and certain persons who beneficially own at least 10% of the
corporation’s stock (an “interested shareholder”). Unless approved in advance
by the board of trustees of the trust, or otherwise exempted by the statute,
such a business combination is prohibited for a period of five years after the
most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested
shareholder.  After such five-year period, a business combination with an interested
shareholder must be: (a) recommended by the board of trustees of the trust, and
(b) approved by the affirmative vote of at least (i) 80% of the trust’s
outstanding shares entitled to vote and (ii) two-thirds of the trust’s
outstanding shares entitled to vote which are not held by the interested
shareholder with whom the business combination is to be effected, unless, among
other things, the trust’s common shareholders receive a “fair price” (as
defined by the statute) for their shares and the consideration is received in
cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for
his or her shares.

In approving a
transaction, Vornado’s Board of Trustees may provide that its approval is
subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and
conditions determined by the Board of Trustees.  Vornado’s Board of Trustees has
adopted a resolution exempting any business combination between Vornado and any
trustee or officer of Vornado or its affiliates.  As a result, any trustee or
officer of Vornado or its affiliates may be able to enter into business
combinations with Vornado that may not be in the best interest of our equity
holders. With respect to business combinations with other persons, the business
combination provisions of the MGCL may have the effect of delaying, deferring
or preventing a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might
involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our equity
holders. The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to
acquire control of Vornado and increase the difficulty of consummating any
offer.

Until 2019, Vornado
has a classified Board of Trustees and that may reduce the likelihood of
certain takeover transactions.

Vornado’s Board of Trustees is divided currently
into three classes of trustees.  Commencing this year, each class of trustees
that is up for election will be elected for a one-year term with all trustees
forming a single class elected annually commencing in 2019.  Historically
trustees of each class have been chosen for three-year staggered terms.
Staggered terms of trustees may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an
attempt to change control of Vornado, even though a tender offer or change in
control might be in the best interest of our equity holders.


Vornado may issue additional shares in a manner that
could adversely affect the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Vornado’s declaration of trust authorizes the
Board of Trustees to:

·

cause
Vornado to issue additional authorized but unissued common shares or preferred
shares;

·

classify
or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred shares;

·

set
the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified shares
that Vornado issues; and

·

increase,
without shareholder approval, the number of shares of beneficial interest that
Vornado may issue.

Vornado’s Board of Trustees could
establish a series of preferred shares whose terms could delay, deter or
prevent a change in control of Vornado, and therefore of the Operating
Partnership, or other transaction that might involve a premium price or
otherwise be in the best interest of our equity holders, although Vornado’s
Board of Trustees does not now intend to establish a series of preferred shares
of this kind. Vornado’s declaration of trust and bylaws contain other
provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado or
other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the
best interest of our equity holders.

We
may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our equity holders.

Our operating and financial policies,
including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other
companies, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization, dividends and
distributions, are exclusively determined by Vornado’s Board of Trustees.
Accordingly, our equity holders do not control these policies.

Our
Ownership Structure and Related-Party Transactions May Give Rise to
Conflicts of Interest.

Steven
Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise substantial influence over us. They
and some of Vornado’s other trustees and officers have interests or positions
in other entities that may compete with us.

As of December 31, 2016, Interstate
Properties, a New Jersey general partnership, and its partners owned an
aggregate of approximately 7.1% of the common shares of Vornado and 26.3% of
the common stock of Alexander’s, which is described below.  Steven Roth, David
Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the three partners of Interstate
Properties. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief
Executive Officer of Vornado, the managing general partner of Interstate
Properties, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive
Officer of Alexander’s. Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are Trustees of
Vornado and also Directors of Alexander’s.

Because of these overlapping interests,
Mr. Roth and Interstate Properties and its partners may have substantial
influence over Vornado, and therefore over the Operating Partnership, and on
the outcome of any matters submitted to Vornado’s shareholders for approval. In
addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure
may present conflicts of interest among Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight
and Interstate Properties and our other equity holders. In addition,
Mr. Roth, Interstate Properties and its partners, and Alexander’s
currently and may in the future engage in a wide variety of activities in the
real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to
matters affecting us, such as which of these entities or persons, if any, may
take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these
entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in which these
entities make investments, potential competition between business activities
conducted, or sought to be conducted, competition for properties and tenants,
possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions and other strategic
decisions affecting the future of these entities.

We manage and lease the real estate
assets of Interstate Properties under a management agreement for which we
receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent.  See
Note 21 –

Related Party Transactions

to our consolidated financial
statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

There may be
conflicts of interest between Alexander’s and us.

As of December 31, 2016, we owned 32.4%
of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s. Alexander’s is a REIT that has
seven properties, which are located in the greater New York metropolitan area. 
In addition to the 2.3% that they indirectly own through Vornado, Interstate
Properties, which is described above, and its partners owned 26.3% of the
outstanding common stock of Alexander’s as of December 31, 2016. Mr. Roth
is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Office of Vornado,
the managing general partner of Interstate Properties, and the Chairman of the
Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s.  Messrs. Wight
and Mandelbaum are Trustees of Vornado and also Directors of Alexander’s and
general partners of Interstate Properties.  Dr. Richard West is a Trustee of
Vornado and a Director of Alexander’s.  In addition, Joseph Macnow, our
Executive Vice President – Finance and Chief Administrative Officer, is the
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Alexander’s, and
Stephen W. Theriot, our Chief Financial Officer, is the Assistant Treasurer of
Alexander’s.


We manage,
develop and lease Alexander’s properties under management and development
agreements and leasing agreements under which we receive annual fees from
Alexander’s. See Note 21 –

consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional

The
Number of Shares of Vornado Realty Trust and the Market for Those Shares Give
Rise to Various Risks.

The trading price of
Vornado’s common shares has been volatile and may fluctuate.

The trading price of Vornado’s common shares has
been volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of a number of
factors, many of which are outside our control.  In addition, the stock market
is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect
the market prices of the shares of many companies.  These broad market
fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market
price of Vornado’s common shares and the redemption price of the Operating
Partnership’s Class A units.  Among those factors are:

·

our financial condition and performance;

·

the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of
tenant bankruptcies or defaults;

·

actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating
results and financial condition;

·

our dividend policy;

·

the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and
the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in comparison to other equity
securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and
fixed income securities;

·

uncertainty and volatility in the equity and credit markets;

·

fluctuations in interest rates;

·

changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of
research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by
rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs;

·

failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;

·

speculation in the press or investment community;

·

strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions
or restructurings;

·

the extent of institutional investor interest in us;

·

the extent of short-selling of Vornado common shares and the
shares of our competitors;

·

fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our
competitors;

·

general financial and economic market conditions and, in
particular, developments related to market conditions for REITs and other real
estate related companies;

·

domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our
performance; and

·

all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report
on the Form 10-K.

A
significant decline in Vornado’s stock price could result in substantial losses
for our equity holders.

Vornado has many
shares available for future sale, which could hurt the market price of its
shares and the redemption price of the Operating Partnership’s units.

The interests of equity holders could be
diluted if we issue additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2016,
Vornado had authorized but unissued, 60,899,124 common shares of beneficial
interest, $.04 par value and 67,116,023 preferred shares of beneficial
interest, no par value; of which 19,538,084 common shares are reserved for
issuance upon redemption of Class A Operating Partnership units, convertible
securities and employee stock options and 11,200,000 preferred shares are
reserved for issuance upon redemption of preferred Operating Partnership
units.  Any shares not reserved may be issued from time to time in public or
private offerings or in connection with acquisitions.  In addition, common and
preferred shares reserved may be sold upon issuance in the public market after
registration under the Securities Act or under Rule 144 under the
Securities Act or other available exemptions from registration.  We cannot
predict the effect that future sales of Vornado’s common and preferred shares
or Operating Partnership Class A and preferred units will have on the market
prices of our securities.

In addition, under Maryland law, Vornado’s
Board of Trustees has the authority to increase the number of authorized shares
without shareholder approval.

New York

As of
December 31, 2016, our New York segment consisted of 28.3

million square feet in 86 properties.  The 28.3
million square feet is comprised of 20.2 million square feet of office space in
36 properties, 2.7 million square feet of retail space in 70 properties, 2,004
units in twelve residential properties, the 1.4 million square foot Hotel
Pennsylvania, and our 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”),
which owns seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area.  The New
York segment also includes 11 garages totaling 1.7 million square feet (4,970
spaces) which are managed by, or leased to, third parties.

New York lease terms generally range from five to seven
years for smaller tenants to as long as 20 years for major tenants, and may
provide for extension options at market rates.  Leases typically provide for
periodic step‑ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to
tenants their share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses
over a base year.  Electricity is provided to tenants on a sub-metered basis or
included in rent based on surveys and adjusted for subsequent utility rate
increases.  Leases also typically provide for free rent and tenant improvement
allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of
its premises.

As of December 31,


, the occupancy rate for our New York segment was 96.5%.

Washington, DC

On October 31, 2016, Vornado’s Board of Trustees approved
the tax-free spin-off of our Washington, DC segment and we entered into a
definitive agreement to merge it with the business and certain select assets of
The JBG Companies (“JBG”), a Washington, DC real estate company.  Steven Roth,
the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado,
will be Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the new company, which will be
named JBG SMITH Properties.  Mitchell Schear, President of our Washington, DC
business, will be a member of the Board of Trustees of the new company.  The
pro rata distribution to Vornado common shareholders and Class A Operating
Partnership unitholders is intended to be treated as a tax-free spin-off for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is expected to be made on a pro rata

1:2

basis.  The initial
Form 10 registration statement relating to the spin-off and merger was filed
with the SEC on January 23, 2017 and the distribution and combination are
expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017. The distribution and
combination are subject to certain conditions, including the SEC declaring the
Form 10 registration statement effective, filing and approval of the new
company’s listing application, receipt of regulatory approvals and third party
consents by each of the Company and JBG, and formal declaration of the
distribution by Vornado’s Board of Trustees. The distribution and combination
are not subject to a vote by Vornado’s shareholders or Operating Partnership
unitholders. Vornado’s Board of Trustees has approved the transaction.  JBG has
obtained all requisite approvals from its investment funds for this
transaction.  There can be no assurance that this transaction will be
completed.

On August 24, 2016, the Skyline
properties, located in Fairfax, Virginia, were placed in receivership.  On
December 21, 2016, the final disposition of the Skyline properties was
completed by the receiver.  In connection therewith, the Skyline properties’ assets
(approximately $236,535,000) and liabilities (approximately $724,412,000), were
removed from our consolidated balance sheet which resulted in a net gain of
$487,877,000.  There was no taxable income related to this transaction.

On December
19, 2016, we completed the sale of our


%
interest in Fairfax Square to our joint venture partner for $

15,500,000

, which resulted in a net
gain of approximately $

15,302,000

.


Washington, DC
– CONTINUED

As of
December 31, 2016, our Washington, DC segment consisted of 58 properties aggregating
14.7 million square feet including 11.1 million square feet of office space in
44 properties, nine residential properties containing 3,156 units and a hotel
property.  The Washington, DC segment also includes 45 garages totaling
approximately 7.0 million square feet (22,110 spaces) which are managed by, or
leased to, third parties.

Washington, DC office lease terms
generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 15
years for major tenants, and may provide for extension options at either
pre-negotiated or market rates. Leases typically provide for periodic step-ups
in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants, the tenants’
share of increases in real estate taxes and certain property operating expenses
over a base year. Periodic step-ups in rent are usually based upon fixed
percentage increases. Leases also typically provide for free rent and tenant
improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial
construction costs of its premises.

As of
December 31, 2016, the occupancy rate for our Washington DC segment was 90.5%,
and 22.4% of the occupied space was leased to various agencies of the U.S.
Government.

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted
by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts (“NAREIT”).  NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to
exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets, real estate
impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate
assets and other specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such
adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are
non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to
facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and
among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and
amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and
implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over
time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions.  FFO does
not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily
indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be
considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash
flow as a liquidity measure.  FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures employed by other companies.

Overview

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated
real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and
substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). 
Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its
shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and
the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their
obligations to creditors.  Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned
approximately

93.7

%
of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of
December 31, 2016.  All references to the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean
collectively Vornado, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries
consolidated by Vornado.

On October 31, 2016, Vornado’s Board of Trustees approved
the tax-free spin-off of our Washington, DC segment and we entered into a
definitive agreement to merge it with the business and certain select assets of
The JBG Companies (“JBG”), a Washington, DC real estate company.  Steven Roth,
the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado,
will be Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the new company, which will be
named JBG SMITH Properties.  Mitchell Schear, President of our Washington, DC
business, will be a member of the Board of Trustees of the new company.  The
pro rata distribution to Vornado common shareholders and Class A Operating Partnership
unitholders is intended to be treated as a tax-free spin-off for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. It is expected to be made on a pro rata

1:2

basis.  The initial
Form 10 registration statement relating to the spin-off and merger was filed
with the SEC on January 23, 2017 and the distribution and combination are
expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017. The distribution and
combination are subject to certain conditions, including the SEC declaring the
Form 10 registration statement effective, filing and approval of the new
company’s listing application, receipt of regulatory approvals and third party
consents by each of the Company and JBG, and formal declaration of the
distribution by Vornado’s Board of Trustees. The distribution and combination
are not subject to a vote by Vornado’s shareholders or Operating Partnership
unitholders. Vornado’s Board of Trustees has approved the transaction.  JBG has
obtained all requisite approvals from its investment funds for this
transaction.  There can be no assurance that this transaction will be
completed.

We
own and operate office and retail properties with large concentrations in the
New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC/Northern Virginia
area. In addition, we have a 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”)
(NYSE: ALX), which owns seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan
area, a 32.5% interest in Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”) as well as interests in
other real estate and related investments.

Our business objective is to
maximize Vornado shareholder value, which we measure by the total return
provided to our shareholders. Below is a table comparing Vornado’s performance
to the FTSE NAREIT Office Index (“Office REIT”) and the MSCI US REIT Index (“MSCI”)
for the following periods ended December 31, 2016:

verview – continued

We intend to
achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and
execute our operating strategies through:

·

maintaining a
superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial
spirit;

·

investing in
properties in select markets, such as New York City, where we believe
there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;

·

acquiring
quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a
significant potential for higher rents;

·

investing in
retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City
metropolitan area;

·

developing and
redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value;
and

·

investing
in operating companies that have a significant real estate component.

We expect to
finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated
funds, proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private
capital markets.  We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or
Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or
otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

We compete with a large number of real estate
property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower
returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents
charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property
and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon,
among other factors, trends of the global, national, regional and local
economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and
prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital,
construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation,
population and employment trends.  See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A for additional
information regarding these factors.

Washington, DC Segment

Excluding the Skyline Properties which
were disposed of on December 21, 2016, our Washington, DC segment EBITDA as
adjusted was $290,500,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is flat
to 2015 as a result of an increase in EBITDA from the core business of $3,100,000,
offset by a decline in EBITDA from properties taken out-of-service of $3,100,000. 
These results are slightly ahead of the guidance we published for 2016.

We expect to complete the spin-off of
our Washington, DC segment in the second quarter of 2017.  We expect that
Washington, DC’s EBITDA as adjusted during the first half of 2017 will be lower
than the first half of 2016 by approximately $1,000,000 to $5,000,000,
comprised of:

(i)

core
business approximately $2,000,000 to $6,000,000 higher than 2016, offset by,

(ii)

reduction
in EBITDA of approximately $6,000,000 to $8,000,000 from 1700 M Street, 1800
South Bell and 1750 Crystal Drive being taken out-of-service for redevelopment.

Investments

On March 17,
2016, we entered into a joint venture, in which we own a

33.3

%
interest, which owns a $

150,000

,000 mezzanine loan with an
interest rate of

LIBOR

plus

8.88

% and an initial maturity
date in

November 2016

, with two three-month
extension options.  On November 9, 2016, the mezzanine loan was extended to

May 2017

with an interest rate of

LIBOR

plus

9.42

% (

10.08

% at December 31, 2016)
during the extension period.  As of December 31, 2016, the joint venture has
fully funded its commitments.  The joint venture’s investment is subordinate to
$

350,000

,000 of third party debt. 
We account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method.

On May 20,
2016, we contributed $

19,650

,000
for a

50.0

% equity interest in a
joint venture that will develop 606 Broadway, a


,000 square foot office and
retail building, located on Houston Street in Manhattan.  The development cost
of this project is estimated to be approximately $

104,000

,000.  At closing, the
joint venture obtained a $

65,000

,000 construction loan, of
which approximately $

25,800

,000

was outstanding at December 31, 2016.  The loan, which bears
interest at

LIBOR

plus

3.00

% (

3.66

% at December 31, 2016), matures
in

May 2019

with two one-year
extension options.  Because this joint venture is a VIE and we determined we
are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate the accounts of this joint venture
from the date of our investment.

Dispositions

On
May 27, 2016, we sold a 47% ownership interest in 7 West 34th Street, a 479,000
square foot Manhattan office building leased to Amazon, and retained the
remaining 53% interest.  This transaction was based on a property value of approximately
$561,000,000 or $1,176 per square foot.  We received net proceeds of
$127,382,000 from the sale and realized a net gain of $203,324,000, of which
$159,511,000 was recognized in the second quarter of 2016 and is included in
“net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets” in our
consolidated statements of income.  The remaining net gain of $43,813,000 has
been deferred until our guarantee of payment of loan principal and interest is
removed or the loan is repaid.  We realized a net tax gain of $90,017,000.   We
continue to manage and lease the property.  We share control over major
decisions with our joint venture partner.  Accordingly, this property is
accounted for under the equity method from the date of sale.

On December 19, 2016, we completed
the sale of our


% interest in Fairfax
Square to our joint venture partner for $

15,500,000

, which resulted in a net gain of
approximately $

15,302,000

.

On August 24, 2016, the Skyline
properties, located in Fairfax, Virginia, were placed in receivership.  On
December 21, 2016, the final disposition of the Skyline properties was
completed by the receiver.  In connection therewith, the Skyline properties’
assets (approximately $236,535,000) and liabilities (approximately
$724,412,000), were removed from our consolidated balance sheet which resulted
in a net gain of $487,877,000.  There was no taxable income related to this
transaction.

Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility

On November 7,
2016, we extended one of our two $

1.25

billion unsecured revolving credit facilities from

June 2017

to

February 2021

with two six-month
extension options.  The interest rate on the extended facility was lowered from

LIBOR

Secured Debt

On February
8, 2016, we completed a $

700,000

office building.  The five-year loan is interest only at

LIBOR

plus

1.75

% (

2.40

% at December 31, 2016),
which was swapped for four and a half years to a fixed rate of 2.56%.  The
Company realized net proceeds of approximately $

330,000

,000.  The property was
previously encumbered by a

5.65

%, $

353,000

,000 mortgage which was
scheduled to mature in

March 2016

.

On
May 16, 2016, we completed a $300,000,000 recourse financing of 7 West 34th
Street.  The ten-year loan is interest only at a fixed rate of 3.65% and
matures in June 2026.

On September
6, 2016, we completed a $

675,000,000

refinancing of theMART, a

3,652,000

square foot commercial
building in Chicago.  The five-year loan is interest only and has a fixed rate
of

2.70

%.  The Company realized
net proceeds of approximately $

124,000,000

.  The property was
previously encumbered by a

5.57

.

On December
2, 2016, we completed a $

400,000,000

refinancing
of 350 Park Avenue, a

571,000

square foot Manhattan
office building.  The ten-year loan is interest only and has a fixed rate of

3.92

%.  The Company realized
net proceeds of approximately $

111,000,000

.  The property was
previously encumbered by a

3.75

%, $

284,000,000

mortgage which was
scheduled to mature in

January 2017

.

Preferred Securities

On September 1, 2016, we redeemed all of the outstanding

6.875

% Series J cumulative
redeemable preferred shares/units at their redemption price of $

25.00

per share/unit, or $

246,250

,000 in the aggregate, plus
accrued and unpaid dividends/distributions through the date of redemption.  In
connection therewith, we expensed $

7,408

,000 of issuance costs,
which reduced net income attributable to common shareholders and net income
attributable to Class A unitholders in the twelve months ended December 31,
2016.  These costs had been initially recorded as a reduction of shareholders’
equity and partners’ capital.

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements
we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the
accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements.  The summary should be read in conjunction
with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2
–

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

to our
consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Real
Estate

Real estate is
carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Betterments,
major renewals and certain costs directly related to the improvement and
leasing of real estate are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as
incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book
value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the
construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are
capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed
the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete. If the cost
of the redeveloped property, including the net book value of the existing property,
exceeds the estimated fair value of redeveloped property, the excess is charged
to expense. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over estimated
useful lives which range from 7 to 40 years. Tenant allowances are amortized on
a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximate
the useful lives of the assets.

Upon
the acquisition of real estate that meets the criteria of a business under ASU
2017-01, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings
and improvements, identified intangibles, such as acquired above and
below-market leases, acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and
acquired liabilities and we allocate the purchase price based on these
assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that
utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market
information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors
including historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic
conditions.  We record acquired intangible assets (including acquired
above-market leases, acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and
acquired intangible liabilities (including below–market leases) at their
estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. We amortize identified
intangibles that have finite lives over the period they are expected to
contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or
business acquired.

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying
amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $14.8 billion and
$14.7 billion, respectively.  As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying
amounts of identified intangible assets (including acquired above-market
leases, tenant relationships and acquired in-place leases) were $192,731,000
and $227,901,000, respectively, and the carrying amounts of identified
intangible liabilities, a component of “deferred revenue” on our consolidated
balance sheets, were $263,786,000 and $318,148,000, respectively.

Our properties, including any related intangible
assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An
impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate
projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an
undiscounted basis.  An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the
property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses
are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market
information at the time the analyses are prepared.  If our estimates of the
projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions
change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such
differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.  The
evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on
assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements
that could differ materially from actual results.  Plans to hold properties
over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.


Critical
Accounting Policies – continued

Partially
Owned Entities

We consolidate entities in which we have a
controlling financial interest.  In determining whether we have a controlling
financial interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to
consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership
interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make
decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the
partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity
(“VIE”) and whether we are the primary beneficiary.  We are deemed to be the
primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have (i) the power to direct the
activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic
performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that
could potentially be significant to the VIE. We generally do not control a
partially owned entity if the entity is not considered a VIE and the approval
of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect to major
decisions, such as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange or other
disposition of real property, the hiring of a chief executive officer, the
commencement, compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or
arbitration or the placement of new or additional financing secured by assets
of the venture.  We account for investments under the equity method when the
requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence
over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially
recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss
and cash contributions and distributions each period. Investments that do not
qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the
cost method.

Investments in partially owned entities are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is measured
based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated
fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding
periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared.  The
ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is
dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment
and market conditions.  If our estimates of the projected future cash flows,
the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities
are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on
market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be
different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial
statements.  The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is
based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and
capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying
amounts of investments in partially owned entities were $1.4 billion and $1.6
billion, respectively.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

We periodically evaluate the collectability of
amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts
($10,920,000 and $11,908,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively)
for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required
payments under the lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables
arising from the straight-lining of rents ($2,227,000 and $2,751,000 as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively). This receivable arises from earnings
recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements.
Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers
payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These
estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our
consolidated financial statements.


Critical
Accounting Policies – continued

Revenue
Recognition

We have the following revenue sources and revenue
recognition policies:

·

Base Rent — income arising from
tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the
related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent
steps and rent abatements under the leases.  We commence rental revenue
recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased
space is substantially ready for its intended use.  In addition, in
circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements
that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of
rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

·

Percentage Rent — income arising
from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon tenant sales exceeding
defined thresholds. These rents are recognized only after the contingency has
been removed (i.e., when tenant sales thresholds have been achieved).

·

Hotel Revenue — income arising from
the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food
and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are
occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services
have been rendered.

·

Trade Shows Revenue — income
arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This
revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred.

·

Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising
from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the
operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This
revenue is recognized in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.

·

Management, Leasing and Other Fees
— income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with
partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services
are performed under the respective agreements.

Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among
other things, its collectability. If our assessment of the collectability of
revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be
material.

Income
Taxes

Vornado operates in a manner intended to enable it
to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) under
Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those
sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a
dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions
will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to
its shareholders. Vornado distributes to its shareholders 100% of its taxable
income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.  If
Vornado fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders,
or fails to meet other REIT requirements, it may fail to qualify as a REIT
which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences.

Net Income and
EBITDA by Segment for the Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 -
continued

Notes to preceding tabular
  information:

(1)

We
  calculate EBITDA on an Operating Partnership basis which is before allocation
  to the noncontrolling interest of the Operating Partnership. We consider
  EBITDA a non-GAAP financial measure for making decisions and assessing the
  unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on
  assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought
  and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to make
  investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to
  that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net
  income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by
  other companies.

Our
  7.5% interest in Fashion Centre Mall/Washington Tower will not be included in
  the spin-off of our Washington, DC segment and have been reclassified to
  Other. The prior year's presentation has been conformed to the current year.

(1)

Primarily from the disposition of 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue and
  higher vacancies at the Skyline properties.  On December 21, 2016, the
  disposition of the Skyline properties was completed by the receiver.

(2)

Primarily due to the demolition of two adjacent office
  properties, 1726 M Street and 1150 17th Street.

(3)

This increase in expense is entirely offset by a corresponding
  decrease in income from the mark-to-market of the deferred compensation plan
  assets, a component of “interest and other investment income, net” on our
  consolidated statements of income.

(4)

Results primarily from the acceleration of the recognition of
  compensation expense in 2015 of $4,542 related to 2012-2014 Out-Performance
  Plans due to the modification of the vesting criteria of awards such that
  they fully vest at age 65.

(5)

On March 15, 2016, we notified the servicer of the $678,000
  non-recourse mortgage loan on the Skyline properties in Virginia that cash
  flow will be insufficient to service the debt and pay other property related
  costs and expenses and that we were not willing to fund additional cash
  shortfalls.  Accordingly, at our request, the loan was transferred to the
  special servicer.  Consequently, based on the shortened holding period for
  the underlying assets, we concluded that the excess of carrying amount over
  our estimate of fair value was not recoverable and recognized a $160,700
  non-cash impairment loss in the first quarter of 2016.

  $39,600, respectively, from our 666 Fifth Avenue (Office) joint venture as a
  result of our share of depreciation expense.  In addition, in 2015 we
  recognized our $12,800 share of a write-off of a below-market lease liability
  related to a tenant vacating at 650 Madison Avenue.

Interest and Other Investment Income, net

Interest and other investment income, net was $29,546,000
in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $26,978,000 in the prior year,
an increase of $2,568,000.  This increase resulted primarily from an increase
in the value of investments in our deferred compensation plan (offset by a
corresponding decrease in the liability for plan assets in general and
administrative expenses).

Interest and Debt Expense

Interest and debt expense

was $402,674,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016,
compared to $378,025,000 in the prior year, an increase of $24,649,000. This
increase was primarily due to (i) $23,205,000 of higher interest expense from
the full year effect of 2015 financings of the St. Regis Retail, 150 West 34th
Street, 100 West 33rd Street, and from the $375,000,000 drawn on our
$750,000,000 delayed draw term loan, (ii) $10,208,000 of lower capitalized
interest, and (iii) $7,823,000 of default interest on our Skyline properties
mortgage loan, partially offset by (iv) $13,127,000 of interest savings from
the re-financings of 888 7th Avenue and 770 Broadway and (v) $4,177,000 of
interest savings from the repayment of the Bowen Building loan.

Net Gain on Extinguishment of Skyline Properties Debt

I

n the year
ended December 31, 2016, upon the final disposition of the Skyline properties, all
assets (approximately $236,535,000) and liabilities (approximately $724,412,000),
were removed from our consolidated balance sheet which resulted in a net gain
of $487,877,000.

Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned
Assets

The net gain of $175,735,000

i

n
the year ended December 31, 2016, consists primarily of a $159,511,000 net gain
on sale of our 47% ownership interest in 7 West 34th Street and a $15,302,000
net gain on sale of our 20% ownership interest in Fairfax Square.  The net gain
of $251,821,000

in the prior year

, consists of
a $142,693,000 net gain on sale of 20 Broad Street, a $102,404,000 net gain on
sale of 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue and $6,724,000 from the sale of residential
condominiums.

Income Tax (Expense) Benefit

In the year ended December 31, 2016, we had an income tax expense
of $8,312,000, compared to a benefit of $84,695,000 in the prior year, an
increase in expense of $93,007,000.  This increase in expense resulted
primarily from the prior year reversal of $90,030,000 of valuation allowances
against certain of our deferred tax assets, as we concluded that it was
more-likely-than-not that we will generate sufficient taxable income from the
sale of 220 Central Park South residential condominium units to realize the
deferred tax assets.

Income from Discontinued Operations

We have reclassified the revenues and expenses of our strip
shopping center and mall business which was spun off to UE on January 15, 2015
and other related retail assets that were sold or are currently held for sale
to “income from discontinued operations” and the related assets and liabilities
to “assets related to discontinued operations” and “liabilities related to
discontinued operations” for all the periods presented in the accompanying
financial statements.

Net income
attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries was
$21,351,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $55,765,000 in the
prior year, a decrease of $34,414,000.  This decrease resulted primarily from
lower net income allocated to the noncontrolling interests of our real estate
fund investments.

Net Income
Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in the Operating Partnership (Vornado
Realty Trust)

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the
Operating Partnership was $53,654,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016,
compared to $43,231,000 in the prior year, an increase of $10,423,000.  This increase
resulted primarily from higher net income subject to allocation to unitholders.

Preferred Share Dividends of Vornado Realty Trust

Preferred share dividends were $75,903,000 in the year
ended December 31, 2016, compared to $80,578,000 in the prior year, a decrease
of $4,675,000.  This decrease resulted primarily from the redemption of the
6.875% Series J cumulative redeemable preferred shares on September 1, 2016.

Preferred Unit Distributions of Vornado Realty L.P.

Preferred unit distributions were $76,097,000 in the year
ended December 31, 2016, compared to $80,736,000 in the prior year, a decrease
of $4,639,000.  This decrease resulted primarily from the redemption of the
6.875% Series J cumulative redeemable preferred units on September 1, 2016.

Preferred Share Issuance Costs

In the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a
$7,408,000 expense in connection with the write-off of issuance costs upon
redeeming all of the outstanding 6.875% Series J cumulative redeemable
preferred shares on September 1, 2016.

Same Store EBITDA

Same store EBITDA represents EBITDA from property level
operations which are owned by us in both the current and prior year reporting
periods.  Same store EBITDA excludes segment-level overhead expenses, which are
expenses that we do not consider to be property-level expenses, as well as
other non-operating items.  We also present same store EBITDA on a cash basis
(which excludes income from the straight-lining of rents, amortization of
acquired below-market leases, net of above-market leases and other non-cash
adjustments).  We present these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) facilitate
meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and
segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties,
and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of
our peers.  Same store EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net
income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures employed by other companies.

Below is the reconciliation of EBITDA to same store EBITDA
for each of our segments for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the

  share of depreciation expense.  Also in 2015, we recognized our $12,800 share
  of a write-off of a below-market lease liability related to a tenant vacating
  at 650 Madison Avenue.  In 2014, we recognized our $14,500 share of
  accelerated depreciation from our West 57th Street joint ventures in

  31, 2014, which was primarily due to a $75,196 non-cash impairment loss.

Interest and Other Investment Income, net

Interest and other investment income, net, was $26,978,000
in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $38,752,000 in the year ended
December 31, 2014, a decrease of $11,774,000.  This decrease resulted primarily
from a decrease in the value of investments in our deferred compensation plan
(offset by a corresponding increase in the liability for plan assets in general
and administrative expenses).

Interest and Debt Expense

Interest and debt expense was $378,025,000 in the year
ended December 31, 2015, compared to $412,755,000 in the year ended December
31, 2014, a decrease of $34,730,000.  This decrease was primarily due to (i)
$26,652,000 of interest savings from the redemption of the $445,000,000
principal amount of the outstanding 7.875% senior unsecured notes during the
fourth quarter of 2014, (ii) $21,375,000 of interest savings from the
redemption of the $500,000,000 principal amount of the outstanding 4.25% senior
unsecured notes on January 1, 2015, partially offset by (iii) $5,297,000 of
interest expense from the issuance of $450,000,000 of 2.50% senior unsecured
notes in June 2014, (iv) $5,182,000 of interest expense from the current year’s
financings of 150 West 34th Street and the Center Building, and (v) $3,481,000
of lower capitalized interest.

Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned
Assets

The net gain of $

251,821,000

in
year ended December 31, 2015, consists of a $142,693,000 net gain on sale of 20
Broad Street, a $102,404,000 net gain on sale of 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue and
$6,724,000 from the sale of residential condominiums.  The net gain of $

13,568,000

in the year ended December 31, 2014

is

from the sale of residential condominiums and a
land parcel.

Income Tax Benefit (Expense)

In the year ended December 31, 2015, we had an income tax benefit
of $84,695,000, compared to an expense of $9,281,000 in the year ended December
31, 2014, a decrease in expense of $93,976,000.  This decrease in expense
resulted primarily from the reversal of the valuation allowances against
certain of our deferred tax assets, as we concluded that it was more-likely
than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income from the sale of 220
Central Park South residential condominium units to realize the deferred tax
assets.

Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the

Notes to preceding tabular
  information:

(1)

We
  calculate EBITDA on an Operating Partnership basis which is before allocation
  to the noncontrolling interest of the Operating Partnership. We consider
  EBITDA a non-GAAP financial measure for making decisions and assessing the
  unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on
  assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought
  and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to make
  investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to
  that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net
  income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by
  other companies.

Our
  7.5% interest in Fashion Centre Mall/Washington Tower will not be included in
  the spin-off of our Washington, DC segment and have been reclassified to
  Other. The prior year's presentation has been conformed to the current year.

Same Store EBITDA

Same store EBITDA represents EBITDA from property level
operations which are owned by us in both the current and prior year reporting
periods.  Same store EBITDA excludes segment-level overhead expenses, which are
expenses that we do not consider to be property-level expenses, as well as
other non-operating items.  We also present same store EBITDA on a cash basis
(which excludes income from the straight-lining of rents, amortization of
acquired below-market leases, net of above-market leases and other non-cash
adjustments).  We present these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) facilitate
meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and
segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties,
and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of
our peers.  Same store EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net
income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures employed by other companies.

Below is the reconciliation of EBITDA to same store EBITDA
for each of our segments for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared
to the three months ended December 31, 2015.

We own
32.4% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, the Chairman of Vornado’s Board of Trustees and
its Chief Executive Officer is also the Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer of Alexander’s.  We provide various services to Alexander’s
in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements.  These
agreements are described in Note 5 -

Investments in Partially Owned Entities

to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Urban Edge

We own 5.4% of UE.  During 2015, we provided transition
services to UE, primarily for information technology, human resources, tax and
financial planning.  In 2016, we continue to provide UE transition services for
information technology and human resources.  UE is providing us with leasing,
development and property management services for certain of our retail
properties including the retail assets of Alexander’s.  Fees to UE for
servicing the retail assets of Alexander’s are similar to the fees that we are
receiving from Alexander’s as described in Note 5 -

Interstate
Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate
is a general partnership in which Mr. Roth is the managing general partner.
David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado
and Directors of Alexander’s, are Interstate’s two other general partners. As
of December 31, 2016, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned an
aggregate of approximately 7.1% of the common shares of beneficial interest of
Vornado and 26.3% of Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real
estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we
receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent.  The
management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable
unless terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the
term.  We believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate
companies, that the management agreement terms are fair to us.

We earned $521,000, $541,000,
and $535,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Property rental income is our primary source of cash flow
and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. Our
cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements,
tenant improvements, debt service, leasing commissions, dividends to
shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, as
well as acquisition and development costs.    Other sources of liquidity to
fund cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including
mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, unsecured term loan and unsecured
revolving credit facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred
equity securities; and asset sales.

We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations
over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations,
cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, cash dividends
to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures.  Capital
requirements for development expenditures and acquisitions may require funding
from borrowings and/or equity offerings.

We may from time to time purchase or retire outstanding
preferred shares and debt securities.  Such purchases, if any, will depend on
prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors.  The
amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our
consolidated financial statements.

Dividends

On January 18, 2017, Vornado declared a quarterly common
dividend of $0.71 per share (an indicated annual rate of $2.84 per common
share).  This dividend, if continued for all of 2017, would require Vornado to
pay out approximately $537,000,000 of cash for common share dividends.  In
addition, during 2017, Vornado expects to pay approximately $65,000,000 of cash
dividends on outstanding preferred shares and approximately $35,000,000 of cash
distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership.

Financing
Activities and Contractual Obligations

We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of
our equity and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status
as a “well-known seasoned issuer.”  We have issued senior unsecured notes from
a shelf registration statement that contain financial covenants that restrict
our ability to incur debt, and that require us to maintain a level of
unencumbered assets based on the level of our secured debt.  Our unsecured revolving
credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum
interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide
for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below
Baa3/BBB.  Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also contain customary
conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties,
and contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated
repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.  As of
December 31, 2016, we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants
required by our senior unsecured notes and our unsecured revolving credit
facilities.

As
of December 31, 2016, we had $1,501,027,000 of cash and cash equivalents and
$2,364,523,000 of borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit
facilities, net of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit of $115,630,000
and $19,847,000, respectively.  A summary of our consolidated debt as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015 is presented below.

Details
of


financing activities are

provided in the
“Overview” of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and
Results of Operations.  Details of 2015 financing activities are discussed
below.

Secured Debt

On April 1, 2015, we completed a
$308,000,000 refinancing of RiverHouse Apartments, a three building, 1,670 unit
rental complex located in Arlington, VA.  The loan is interest only at LIBOR
plus 1.28% and matures in 2025.  We realized net proceeds of approximately
$43,000,000.  The property was previously encumbered by a 5.43%, $195,000,000
mortgage which was scheduled to mature in April 2015 and a $64,000,000 mortgage
at LIBOR plus 1.53% which was scheduled to mature in 2018.

On June 2, 2015, we completed a
$205,000,000 financing in connection with the acquisition of 150 West 34th
Street.  The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% and matures in 2018 with
two one-year extension options.

On July 28, 2015, we completed a
$580,000,000 refinancing of 100 West 33rd Street, a 1.1 million square
foot property comprised of 855,000 square feet of office space and the 256,000
square foot Manhattan Mall.  The loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.65% and
matures in July 2020.  We realized net proceeds of approximately $242,000,000.

On September 22, 2015, we upsized the loan
on our 220 Central Park South development by $350,000,000 to $950,000,000.  The
interest rate on the loan is LIBOR plus 2.00% and the final maturity date is
2020.  In connection with the upsizing, the standby commitment for a
$500,000,000 mezzanine loan for this development has been terminated by payment
of a $15,000,000 contractual termination fee, which was capitalized as a
component of “development costs and construction in progress” on our
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.

On
December 11, 2015, we completed a $375,000,000 refinancing of 888 Seventh
Avenue, a 882,000 square foot Manhattan office building.  The five-year loan is
interest only at LIBOR plus 1.60% which was swapped for the term of the loan to
a fixed rate of 3.15% and matures in December 2020.  We realized net proceeds
of approximately $49,000,000.

On
December 21, 2015, we completed a $450,000,000 financing of the retail
condominium of the St. Regis Hotel and the adjacent retail town house located
on Fifth Avenue at 55th Street.  The loan matures in December 2020, with two
one-year extension options.  The loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.80% for
the first three years, LIBOR plus 1.90% for years four and five, and LIBOR plus
2.00% during the extension periods.  We own a 74.3% controlling interest in the
joint venture which owns the property.

Senior Unsecured Notes

On
January 1, 2015, we redeemed all of the $500,000,000 principal amount of our
outstanding 4.25% senior unsecured notes, which were scheduled to mature on
April 1, 2015, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus
accrued interest through December 31, 2014.

Unsecured Term Loan

On October 30, 2015, we entered into an unsecured
delayed-draw term loan facility in the maximum amount of $750,000,000.  The
facility matures in October 2018 with two one-year extension options.  The
interest rate is LIBOR plus 1.15% with a fee of 0.20% per annum on the unused
portion.  At closing, we drew $187,500,000.  The facility provides that the maximum
amount available is twice the amount outstanding on April 29, 2016, limited to
$750,000,000, and all draws must be made by October 2017.  This facility,
together with the $950,000,000 development loan mentioned above, provides the
funding for our 220 Central Park South development.

Acquisitions and Investments

On January 20, 2015, we co-invested with
the Vornado Capital Partners Real Estate Fund (“Fund”) and one of the Fund’s
limited partners to buy out the Fund’s joint venture partner’s 57.1% interest
in the Crowne Plaza Times Square Hotel.  The purchase price for the 57.1%
interest was approximately $95,000,000 (our share $39,000,000) which valued the
property at approximately $480,000,000.  The property is encumbered by a
$310,000,000 mortgage loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.80% and maturing in
December 2018 with a one-year extension option.  Our aggregate ownership
interest in the property increased to 33% from 11%.

On March 18, 2015, we acquired the Center
Building, a 437,000 square foot office building, located at 33-00 Northern
Boulevard in Long Island City, New York, for $142,000,000, including the
assumption of an existing $62,000,000, 4.43% mortgage maturing in October 2018.

On June 2, 2015, we completed the
acquisition of 150 West 34th Street, a 78,000 square foot retail property
leased to Old Navy through May 2019, and 226,000 square feet of additional
zoning air rights, for approximately $355,000,000.  At closing we completed a
$205,000,000 financing of the property.

On June 24, 2015, we entered into a joint
venture, in which we own a 55% interest, to develop a 173,000 square foot
Class-A office building, located along the western edge of the High Line at 512
West 22nd Street. The development cost of this project is approximately
$235,000,000. The development commenced during the fourth quarter of 2015 and
is expected to be completed in 2018. We account for our investment in the joint
venture under the equity method.

On July 31, 2015, we acquired 260 Eleventh
Avenue, a 235,000 square foot office property leased to the City of New York
through 2021 with two five-year renewal options, a 10,000 square foot parking
lot and additional air rights.  The transaction is structured as a 99-year
ground lease with an option to purchase the land for $110,000,000.  The
$3,900,000 annual ground rent and the purchase option price escalate annually
at the lesser of 1.5% or CPI.  The buildings were purchased for 813,900 newly
issued Operating Partnership units valued at approximately $80,000,000.

On September 25, 2015, we acquired 265
West 34th Street, a 1,700 square foot retail property and 15,200 square feet of
additional zoning air rights, for approximately $28,500,000.

Development and Redevelopment Expenditures

We are constructing a residential condominium tower
containing 397,000 salable square feet on our 220 Central Park South
development site. The incremental development cost of this project is estimated
to be approximately $1.3 billion, of which $609,420,000 has been expended as of
December 31, 2016.

We are developing a 173,000 square foot Class-A office
building at 512 West 22nd Street, along the western edge of the High Line in
the West Chelsea submarket of Manhattan (55.0% owned).  The incremental
development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $130,000,000,
of which our share is $72,000,000.  As of December 31, 2016, $30,143,000 has
been expended, of which our share is $16,579,000.

We are developing a 170,000 square foot office and retail
building at 61 Ninth Avenue, located on the southwest corner of Ninth Avenue
and 15th Street in the West Chelsea submarket of Manhattan.  In February 2016,
the venture purchased an adjacent five story loft building and air rights in
exchange for a 10% common and preferred equity interest in the venture valued
at $19,400,000, which reduced our ownership interest to 45.1% from 50.1%.  On
December 21, 2016, the venture obtained a $90,000,000 construction loan. The
loan matures in December 2020 with two six-month extension options. The
interest rate is LIBOR plus 3.05%. As of December 31, 2016, there was nothing
drawn on this loan. The incremental development cost of this project is
estimated to be approximately $150,000,000, of which our share is $68,000,000. 
As of December 31, 2016, $38,499,000 has been expended, of which our share is
$17,363,000.

We are developing a 34,000 square foot office and retail building
at 606 Broadway, located on the northeast corner of Broadway and Houston Street
in Manhattan (50.0% owned).   At closing, the joint venture obtained a
$65,000,000 construction loan, of which approximately $25,800,000 was
outstanding as of December 31, 2016. The loan, which bears interest at LIBOR
plus 3.00% (3.66% at December 31, 2016), matures in May 2019 with two one-year
extension options. The venture’s incremental development cost of this project
is estimated to be approximately $60,000,000, of which our share is $30,000,000.
As of

December 31, 2016

, $20,833,000 has been expended, of which our share is
$10,417,000.

We are in the process of demolishing
two adjacent Washington, DC office properties, 1726 M Street and 1150 17th
Street, and will replace them in the future with a new 335,000 square foot
Class A office building, to be addressed 1700 M Street.  The incremental
development cost of the project is estimated to be approximately $170,000,000,
of which $10,500,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2016.

In September 2016, a joint
venture between the Related Companies and Vornado was designated by New York
State to redevelop the historic Farley Post Office building. The building will
include a new Moynihan Train Hall and approximately 850,000 rentable square
feet of office space and ancillary train hall retail.  The joint venture will
enter into a 99-year, triple-net lease and make a $230,000,000 contribution
towards the construction of the train hall.  Total costs for the redevelopment
of the office and retail space are yet to be determined.

We are also evaluating other
development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in
Manhattan, including, in particular, the Penn Plaza District.

There can be no assurance that any of our development or
redevelopment projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed, or
completed on schedule or within budget.

Insurance

We
maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence
and per property, and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits
of $2.0 billion per occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as
flood and earthquake. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with
coverage of $180,000,000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate, subject to
a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. We
maintain coverage for terrorism acts with limits of $4.0 billion per occurrence
and in the aggregate, and $2.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for
terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”)
terrorism events, as defined by Terrorism Risk Insurance Program
Reauthorization Act of 2015, which expires in December 2020.

Penn
Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated
subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of all risk property
and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage,
and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism including NBCR acts.
Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by
third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to
PPIC. For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $1,622,000
($1,976,000 for 2017) and 16% (17% for 2017) of the balance of a covered loss
and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining portion of a
covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC.

We
continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs
of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage
will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future.

Our
debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which
are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements
contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we
believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these
agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at
reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage
than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our
properties and expand our portfolio.

Other
Commitments and Contingencies

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal
counsel, the outcome of such matters is not expected to have a material adverse
effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of
environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did
not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no
assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the
extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or
changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us.  However, in certain
cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space.  These
guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of
specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans.  As of December
31, 2016, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is
approximately $737,000,000.

As of December 31, 2016, $19,847,000 of letters of credit were
outstanding under one of our unsecured revolving credit facilities.  Our
unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require
us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market
capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a
decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities
also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including
representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default
that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure
to pay interest or principal.

As of December 31, 2016, we expect to fund additional capital to
certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $173,000,000,
which includes our share of the commitments of the Farley Post Office
redevelopment joint venture.

As of December 31, 2016, we have construction commitments
aggregating $653,940,000.

Funds From Operations
(“FFO”)

Vornado
Realty Trust

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted
by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to
exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets, real estate
impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate
assets and other specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such
adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are
non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate
meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our
peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and
amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and
implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over
time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions.  FFO does
not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily
indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be
considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash
flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures employed by other companies.

FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions
was

$1,457,583,000, or $7.66

per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016,
compared to

$1,039,035,000, or $5.48

per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015.
FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was

$797,734,000, or $4.20

per
diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to

$259,528,000, or $1.37

per
diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2015.  Details
of certain items that impact FFO are discussed in the financial results summary
of our “Overview.”

We
may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest
rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies,
depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and
risks of such strategies. As of December 31, 2016, we have an interest rate
swap on a $412,000,000 mortgage loan that swapped the rate from LIBOR plus
1.65% (2.27% at December 31, 2016) to a fixed rate of 4.78% through March 2018
and an interest swap on a $375,000,000 mortgage loan on 888 Seventh Avenue that
swapped the rate from LIBOR plus 1.60% (2.22% at December 31, 2016) to a fixed
rate of 3.15% through December 2020.

In connection
with the $700,000,000 refinancing of 770 Broadway, we entered into an interest
rate swap from LIBOR plus 1.75% (2.40% at December 31, 2016) to a fixed rate of
2.56% through September 2020.

Fair Value of Debt

The estimated fair value of our consolidated debt is
calculated based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at the
current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar
credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt.  As of December 31, 2016,
the estimated fair value of our consolidated debt was $10,746,000,000.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board of Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Vornado Realty Trust (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015,
and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2016. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and
financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Vornado
Realty Trust at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control—

Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated February 13, 2017 expressed an unqualified
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Partners

Vornado Realty L.P.

New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Vornado Realty L.P. and consolidated subsidiaries (the “Partnership”)
as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of
income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2016. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial
statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
Partnership’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Vornado
Realty L.P. and consolidated subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2016, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—

Integrated
Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated February 13, 2017 expressed an
unqualified opinion on the Partnership’s internal control over financial
reporting.

VORNADO REALTY TRUST AND VORNADO REALTY L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.     Organization and
Business

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated
real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and
substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). 
Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its
shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and
the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their
obligations to creditors.  Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned
approximately

93.7

% of the common
limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31,
2016.  All references to the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean collectively
Vornado, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries consolidated
by Vornado.

On October 31, 2016, Vornado’s Board of Trustees approved
the tax-free spin-off of our Washington, DC segment and we entered into a
definitive agreement to merge it with the business and certain select assets of
The JBG Companies (“JBG”), a Washington, DC real estate company.  Steven Roth,
the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado,
will be Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the new company, which will be
named JBG SMITH Properties.  Mitchell Schear, President of our Washington, DC
business, will be a member of the Board of Trustees of the new company.  The
pro rata distribution to Vornado common shareholders and Class A Operating
Partnership unitholders is intended to be treated as a tax-free spin-off for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is expected to be made on a pro rata

1:2

basis.  The initial
Form 10 registration statement relating to the spin-off and merger was filed
with the SEC on January 23, 2017 and the distribution and combination are
expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017. The distribution and
combination are subject to certain conditions, including the SEC declaring the
Form 10 registration statement effective, filing and approval of the new
company’s listing application, receipt of regulatory approvals and third party
consents by each of the Company and JBG, and formal declaration of the distribution
by Vornado’s Board of Trustees. The distribution and combination are not
subject to a vote by Vornado’s shareholders or Operating Partnership
unitholders. Vornado’s Board of Trustees has approved the transaction.  JBG has
obtained all requisite approvals from its investment funds for this
transaction.  There can be no assurance that this transaction will be
completed.

We currently own all or portions of:

New York:

·

20.2

million square feet
of Manhattan office space in


properties;

·

2.7

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

2.    Basis of Presentation
and Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Vornado and the Operating Partnership and their consolidated
subsidiaries. All inter-company amounts have been eliminated.  Our consolidated
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), which require us
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Literature

In May 2014,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board

(“

FASB”) issued
an update ("ASU 2014-09") establishing Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

(“ASC
606”).  ASU 2014-09 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to
use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and
supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance.  ASU 2014-09
requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the
entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and also
requires certain additional disclosures.  In August 2015, the FASB issued an
update (“ASU 2015-14”) to ASC 606,

Deferral of the Effective Date

, which
defers the adoption of ASU 2014-09 to interim and annual reporting periods in
fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2017.  In March 2016, the FASB
issued an update (“ASU 2016-08”) to ASC 606,

Principal versus Agent
Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)

, which clarifies the
implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new
revenue recognition standard pursuant to ASU 2014-09.  In April 2016, the FASB
issued an update (“ASU 2016-10”) to ASC 606,

Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing

, which clarifies guidance related to identifying
performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance contained in ASU
2014-09.  In May 2016, the FASB issued an update (“ASU 2016-12”) to ASC 606,

Narrow-Scope
Improvements and Practical Expedients

, which amends certain aspects of the
new revenue recognition standard pursuant to ASU 2014-09.

We are permitted to use either the retrospective or the modified
retrospective method when adopting these standards.  We are evaluating the
impact of the adoption of these standards on our consolidated financial
statements and have not yet concluded on the method of adoption.

In June
2014, the FASB issued an update (“ASU 2014-12”) to ASC Topic 718,

Compensation
– Stock Compensation

(“ASC 718”).  ASU 2014-12 requires an entity to treat
performance targets that can be met after the requisite service period of a
share based award has ended, as a performance condition that affects vesting. 
ASU 2014-12 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal
years that began after December 15, 2015.  The adoption of this update as of
January 1, 2016, did not have any impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

In February
2015, the FASB issued an update (“ASU 2015-02”)

Amendments to the
Consolidation Analysis

to ASC Topic 810,

Consolidation

.  ASU 2015-02
affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should
consolidate certain legal entities.  Specifically, the amendments: (i) modify
the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are
variable interest entities ("VIEs") or voting interest entities, (ii)
eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited
partnership, (iii) affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that
are involved with VIEs, and (iv) provide a scope exception for certain
entities.  ASU 2015-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2015.  The adoption of this update on January 1,
2016 resulted in the identification of additional VIEs, but did not have an
impact on our consolidated financial statements other than additional
disclosures

(see Note 11 -

Variable Interest
Entities

)

In January
2016, the FASB issued an update (“ASU 2016-01”)

Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

to ASC Topic 825,

Financial
Instruments

.  ASU 2016-01 amends certain aspects of recognition,
measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments, including
the requirement to measure certain equity investments at fair value with
changes in fair value recognized in net income.  ASU 2016-01 is effective
for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption
of ASU 2016-01 on our consolidated financial statements.

In
February 2016, the FASB issued (“ASU 2016-02”)

Leases

, which sets out
the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of
leases for both lessees and lessors.  ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to apply a
dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based
on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase.
 Lessees are required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability
for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months. Leases with a term of 12
months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating
leases.  Lessees will recognize expense based on the effective interest method
for finance leases or on a straight-line basis for operating leases.  ASU
2016-02 will more significantly impact the accounting for leases in which we
are a lessee.  We have a number of ground leases for which we will be required
to record a right-of-use asset and lease liability upon adoption of this
standard.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating
the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial
statements, including the timing of adopting this standard.

In
March 2016, the FASB issued an update (“ASU 2016-09”)

Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

to ASC 718.  ASU 2016-09
amends several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions,
including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU
2016-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2016.  We are currently evaluating the impact
of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements.

In
August 2016, the FASB issued an update (“ASU 2016-15”)

Classification of
Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

to ASC Topic 230,

Statement
of Cash Flows

. ASU 2016-15 clarifies guidance on the classification of
certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows to reduce
diversity in practice with respect to (i) debt prepayment or debt
extinguishment costs, (ii) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other
debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation
to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, (iii) contingent consideration
payments made after a business combination, (iv) proceeds from the settlement
of insurance claims, (v) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life
insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, (vi) distributions
received from equity method investees, (vii) beneficial interests in
securitization transactions, and (viii) separately identifiable cash flows
and application of the predominance principle.  ASU 2016-15 is effective
for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  The adoption of this
update is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

In
November 2016, the FASB issued an update (“ASU 2016-18”)

Restricted Cash

to ASC Topic 230,

Statement of Cash Flows

. ASU 2016-18 requires
that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the
total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted
cash or restricted cash equivalents.  Restricted cash and restricted cash
equivalents will be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling
the beginning-of-period and end-of-period balances on the statement of cash
flows upon adoption of this standard. ASU 2016-18 is effective for interim and
annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017,
with early adoption permitted.

In
January 2017, the FASB issued an update (“ASU 2017-01”)

Clarifying the
Definition of a Business

to ASC Topic 805,

Business Combinations

. ASU
2017-01 provides a screen to determine when an asset acquired or group of
assets acquired is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially
all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is
concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable
assets, the set is not a business. This screen reduces the number of
transactions that need to be further evaluated. ASU 2017-01 is effective for
interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2017.  We have elected to early adopt this standard, effective as of
October 1, 2016, for all future acquisitions.  The adoption of this standard
will result in less real estate acquisitions qualifying as businesses and,
accordingly, acquisition costs for those acquisitions that are not businesses
will be capitalized rather than expensed.  There was no impact of the adoption
of this standard in the fourth quarter of 2016, as there have been no
acquisitions.

Significant
Accounting Policies

Real Estate:

Real
estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly related to the
improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs
are expensed as incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties,
the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost
for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with the
redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the
property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property
when complete. If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the net book
value of the existing property, exceeds the estimated fair value of redeveloped
property, the excess is charged to expense. Depreciation is recognized on a
straight-line basis over estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40 years.
Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the
related leases, which approximate the useful lives of the assets.

Additions to real estate
include interest and debt expense capitalized during construction of $

34,097,000

and $

59,305,000

for the years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Upon the acquisition of real estate that meets the criteria
of a business under ASU 2017-01, we assess the fair value of acquired assets
(including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles, such as
acquired above and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases and tenant
relationships) and acquired liabilities and we allocate the purchase price
based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow
projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and
available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a
number of factors including historical operating results, known trends, and
market/economic conditions.  We record acquired intangible assets (including
acquired above-market leases, acquired in-place leases and tenant
relationships) and acquired intangible liabilities (including below–market
leases) at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. We
amortize identified intangibles that have finite lives over the period they are
expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the
property or business acquired.

Our
properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying
amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the
anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis.  An impairment loss is
measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying amount over its
estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on our current plans,
intended holding periods and available market information at the time the
analyses are prepared.  If our estimates of the projected future cash flows,
anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change, our evaluation of
impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to
our consolidated financial statements.  The evaluation of anticipated cash flows
is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy,
rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual
results.  Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood
of recording impairment losses.

Partially
Owned Entities:

We consolidate
entities in which we have a controlling financial interest.

In determining whether we have a controlling financial
interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the
accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board
representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and
contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as
well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and whether we
are the primary beneficiary.  We are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a
VIE when we have (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to
absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the
VIE. We generally do not control a partially owned entity if the entity is not
considered a VIE and the approval of all of the partners/members is
contractually required with respect to major decisions, such as operating and
capital budgets, the sale, exchange or other disposition of real property, the
hiring of a chief executive officer, the commencement, compromise or settlement
of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or arbitration or the placement of new or
additional financing secured by assets of the venture.  We account for
investments under the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are
not met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee.
Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently
adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and
distributions each period. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or
equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method.

Investments
in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying
amount of an investment over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are
based on current plans, intended holding periods and available information at
the time the analyses are prepared.  In the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015
and 2014, we recognized non-cash impairment losses on investments in partially
owned entities aggregating $

20,290

,000

, $

21,260

,000

and $

85,459

,000, respectively. 
Included in 2014 is a $

75,196

,000 impairment loss
related to our investment in Toys.

Cash and
Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash
equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due
to their short-term maturities.  The majority of our cash and cash equivalents consists
of (i) deposits at major commercial banks, which may at times exceed the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit, (ii) United States Treasury Bills,
and (iii) Certificate of Deposits placed through an Account Registry Service
(“CDARS”).  To date, we have not experienced any losses on our invested cash.

Restricted
Cash:

Restricted cash consists of
security deposits, cash restricted for the purposes of facilitating a Section
1031 Like-Kind exchange, cash restricted in connection with our deferred
compensation plan and cash escrowed under loan agreements for debt service,
real estate taxes, property insurance and capital improvements.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts:

We
periodically evaluate the collectability of amounts due from tenants and
maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from
the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements.
We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining
of rents. These receivables arise from earnings recognized in excess of amounts
currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in
establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit
status in developing these estimates.  As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had
$10,920,000 and $11,908,000, respectively, in allowances for doubtful accounts.
In addition, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $2,227,000 and
$2,751,000, respectively, in allowances for receivables arising from the
straight-lining of rents.

Deferred
Charges:

Direct financing costs are
deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements as a component
of interest expense. Direct costs related to successful leasing activities are
capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the lives of the
related leases. All other deferred charges are amortized on a straight line basis,
which approximates the effective interest rate method, in accordance with the
terms of the agreements to which they relate.

Revenue Recognition:

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:

•      Base Rent — income arising from
tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the
related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent
steps and rent abatements under the leases.  We commence rental revenue
recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased
space is substantially ready for its intended use.  In addition, in
circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements
that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of
rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

•      Percentage Rent — income arising
from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon tenant sales exceeding
defined thresholds. These rents are recognized only after the contingency has
been removed (i.e., when tenant sales thresholds have been achieved).

•      Hotel Revenue — income arising
from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue,
food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms
are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue is recognized when the
services have been rendered.

•      Trade Shows Revenue — income
arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue
is recognized when the trade shows have occurred.

•      Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising
from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the
operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This
revenue is recognized in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.

•      Management, Leasing and Other
Fees — income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with
partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services
are performed under the respective agreements.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities:

ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, as amended,
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our derivative
instruments consisted of two and one interest rate swaps, respectively.  We
record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for
changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the
derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the
exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm
commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are
considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted
transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in
the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk
are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the
effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially
reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (outside of earnings) and
subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects
earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the
derivative is recognized directly in earnings. We assess the effectiveness of
each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows
of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash
flows of the designated hedged item or transaction. For derivatives not
designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.

Income Taxes:

Vornado
operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a REIT
under Sections 856‑860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least


% of its REIT taxable
income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain
other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which
is distributed to its shareholders. Vornado distributes to its shareholders


% of its taxable income and
therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.  Dividends
distributed for the year ended December 31, 2016, were characterized, for
federal income tax purposes, as

83.5

% ordinary income and

16.5

% long-term capital gain.  Dividends
distributed for the year ended December 31, 2015, were characterized, for
federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain income.  Dividends
distributed for the year ended December 31, 2014, were characterized, for
federal income tax purposes, as ordinary income.

The Operating
Partnership’s partners are required to report their respective share of taxable
income on their individual tax returns.  We have elected to treat certain
consolidated subsidiaries, and may in the future elect to treat newly formed
subsidiaries, as taxable REIT subsidiaries pursuant to an amendment to the
Internal Revenue Code that became effective January 1, 2001.  Taxable REIT
subsidiaries may participate in non-real estate related activities and/or
perform non-customary services for tenants and are subject to Federal and State
income tax at regular corporate tax rates. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries had a
combined current income tax expense of approximately $

7,946,000

, $

8,322,000

and $

10,777,000

for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and have immaterial differences
between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities.

At December 31, 2016 and 2015,

our taxable REIT subsidiaries had deferred
tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards of

$

98,013,000

and $

97,104,000

, respectively,

which are included in “other assets” on
our consolidated balance sheets.  Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2015,
there was a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets because
we had not determined that it is more-likely-than-not that we would use the net
operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income.  In our quarter
ended June 30, 2015, based upon residential condominium unit sales, among other
factors, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that we will generate
sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets.  Accordingly,
we reversed $

90,030

,000 of the allowance for
deferred tax assets and recognized an income tax benefit in our consolidated statements
of income.

plus

1.75

% (

On September 6, 2016, we
completed a $

refinancing of
theMART, a

On December 2, 2016, we completed
a $

refinancing of 350
Park Avenue, a

square foot Manhattan office building.  The ten-year loan is interest only and
has a fixed rate of

.  The property was previously encumbered by
a

284,000,000

mortgage which was scheduled to mature in

January 2017

.

On March 15,
2016, we notified the servicer of the $

678,000

,000
non-recourse mortgage loan on the Skyline properties located in Fairfax, Virginia,
that cash flow will be insufficient to service the debt and pay other property
related costs and expenses and that we were not willing to fund additional cash
shortfalls.  Accordingly, at our request, the loan was transferred to the
special servicer.  Consequently, based on the shortened holding period for the
underlying assets, we concluded that the excess of carrying amount over our
estimate of fair value was not recoverable and recognized a $

160,700

,000 non-cash impairment
loss in the first quarter of 2016.  The Company’s estimate of fair value was
derived from a discounted cash flow model based upon market conditions and
expectations of growth and utilized unobservable quantitative inputs including
a capitalization rate of

8.0

% and a discount rate of

8.2

%.  In the second quarter
of 2016, cash flow became insufficient to service the debt and we ceased making
debt service payments.  Pursuant to the loan agreement, the loan was in
default, and was subject to incremental default interest which increased the
weighted average interest rate from

2.97

% to

4.51

% while the outstanding
balance remains unpaid. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $

7,823

,000 of default interest
expense.  On August 24, 2016, the Skyline properties were placed in
receivership.  On December 21, 2016, the disposition of the Skyline properties
was completed by the receiver.  In connection therewith, the Skyline
properties’ assets (approximately $

236,535

,000) and liabilities
(approximately aggregating $

724,412

,000), were removed from
our consolidated balance sheet which resulted in a net gain of $

487,877

,000.  There was no taxable
income related to this transaction.

Noncontrolling Interests/Redeemable Partnership Units

Redeemable
noncontrolling interests on Vornado’s consolidated balance sheets and
redeemable partnership units on the consolidated balance sheets of the
Operating Partnership are primarily comprised of Class A Operating Partnership
units held by third parties and are recorded at the greater of their carrying
amount or redemption value at the end of each reporting period.  Changes in the
value from period to period are charged to “additional capital” in Vornado’s
consolidated statements of changes in equity and to “partners’ capital” on the
consolidated balance sheets of the Operating Partnership.  Class A units may be
tendered for redemption to the Operating Partnership for cash; Vornado, at its
option, may assume that obligation and pay the holder either cash or Vornado
common shares on a one-for-one basis.  Because the number of Vornado common
shares outstanding at all times equals the number of Class A units owned by
Vornado, the redemption value of each Class A unit is equivalent to the market
value of one Vornado common share, and the quarterly distribution to a Class A
unitholder is equal to the quarterly dividend paid to a Vornado common
shareholder.

Unconsolidated VIEs

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we
have several unconsolidated VIEs.  We do not consolidate these entities because
we are not the primary beneficiary and the nature of our involvement in the
activities of these entities does not give us power over decisions that
significantly affect these entities’ economic performance.  We account for our
investment in these entities under the equity method (see Note 5 –

Investments
in Partially Owned Entities

).  As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the net
carrying amount of our investments in these entities was $

392,150,000

and $

, respectively, and our
maximum exposure to loss in these entities, is limited to our investments.

Consolidated VIEs

We adopted ASU 2015-02 on January 1,
2016 which resulted in the identification of several VIEs which, prior to the
adoption of ASU 2015-02, were consolidated under the voting interest model.  Vornado’s
most significant consolidated VIEs are our Operating Partnership, real estate
fund investments, and certain properties that have non-controlling interests. 
These entities are VIEs because the non-controlling interests do not have
substantive kick-out or participating rights.  We consolidate these entities
because we control all significant business activities.

As of December 31, 2016, the total assets
and liabilities of our consolidated VIEs, excluding the Operating Partnership,
are $

and $

12.  Fair Value
Measurements

ASC
820 defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. 
The objective of fair value is to determine the price that would be received
upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit
price).

ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes
observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three
levels: Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are
accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities; Level 2 –
observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but
corroborated by market data; and Level 3 – unobservable inputs that are used
when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the
highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.
In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the
use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the
extent possible, as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment
of fair value.  Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret Level 2 and 3
inputs in determining the fair value of our financial and non-financial assets
and liabilities.  Accordingly, our fair value estimates, which are made at the
end of each reporting period, may be different than the amounts that may
ultimately be realized upon sale or disposition of these assets.

Financial
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Financial
assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on our consolidated
balance sheets consist of (i) marketable securities, (ii) real estate fund
investments, (iii) the assets in our deferred compensation plan (for which
there is a corresponding liability on our consolidated balance sheet), (iv)
mandatorily redeemable instruments (Series G-1 through G-4 convertible
preferred units and Series D-13 cumulative redeemable preferred units), and (v)
interest rate swaps.  The tables below aggregate the fair values of these
financial assets and liabilities by their levels in the fair value hierarchy at

Real Estate Fund Investments

At December 31, 2016, we had six real estate fund
investments with an aggregate fair value of $

462,132,000

, or $

153,197,000

in excess of cost.  These
investments are classified as Level 3.  We use a discounted cash flow valuation
technique to estimate the fair value of each of these investments, which is
updated quarterly by personnel responsible for the management of each investment
and reviewed by senior management at each reporting period.  The discounted
cash flow valuation technique requires us to estimate cash flows for each
investment over the anticipated holding period, which currently ranges from 1.0
to 4.0 years.  Cash flows are derived from property rental revenue (base rents
plus reimbursements) less operating expenses, real estate taxes and capital and
other costs, plus projected sales proceeds in the year of exit.  Property
rental revenue is based on leases currently in place and our estimates for
future leasing activity, which are based on current market rents for similar
space plus a projected growth factor.  Similarly, estimated operating expenses
and real estate taxes are based on amounts incurred in the current period plus
a projected growth factor for future periods.  Anticipated sales proceeds at
the end of an investment’s expected holding period are determined based on the
net cash flow of the investment in the year of exit, divided by a terminal
capitalization rate, less estimated selling costs.

The fair value of each property is calculated by
discounting the future cash flows (including the projected sales proceeds),
using an appropriate discount rate and then reduced by the property’s
outstanding debt, if any, to determine the fair value of the equity in each
investment. Significant unobservable quantitative inputs used in determining
the fair value of each investment include capitalization rates and discount
rates.  These rates are based on the location, type and nature of each
property, and current and anticipated market conditions, industry publications
and from the experience of our Acquisitions and Capital Markets departments. 
Significant unobservable quantitative inputs in the table below were utilized
in determining the fair value of these real estate fund investments at December
31, 2016.

uncertainties in the valuation models with respect to terminal capitalization
rates and the amount and timing of cash flows.  Therefore, a change in the fair
value of these investments resulting from a change in the terminal
capitalization rate, may be partially offset by a change in the discount rate. 
It is not possible for us to predict the effect of future economic or market
conditions on our estimated fair values.

Deferred Compensation Plan Assets

Deferred compensation plan assets that are classified as
Level 3 consist of investments in limited partnerships and investment funds,
which are managed by third parties.  We receive quarterly financial reports
from a third-party administrator, which are compiled from the quarterly reports
provided to them from each limited partnership and investment fund.  The
quarterly reports provide net asset values on a fair value basis which are
audited by independent public accounting firms on an annual basis.  The third-party
administrator does not adjust these values in determining our share of the net
assets and we do not adjust these values when reported in our consolidated
financial statements.

deferred compensation plan assets that are classified as Level 3, for the years

There
were no assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on our
consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Financial
Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value

Financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at
fair value on our consolidated balance sheets include cash equivalents
(primarily money market funds, which invest in obligations of the United States
government), and our secured and unsecured debt.  Estimates of the fair value
of these instruments are determined by the standard practice of modeling the
contractual cash flows required under the instrument and discounting them back
to their present value at the appropriate current risk adjusted interest rate,
which is provided by a third-party specialist.  For floating rate debt, we use
forward rates derived from observable market yield curves to project the
expected cash flows we would be required to make under the instrument.  The
fair value of cash equivalents and borrowings under our unsecured revolving
credit facilities and unsecured term loan are classified as Level 1.  The fair
value of our secured debt and senior unsecured debt are classified as Level 2.

13.    Stock-based
Compensation

Vornado’s 2010 Omnibus Share Plan (the
“Plan”) provides the Compensation Committee of Vornado’s Board of Trustees (the
“Committee”) the ability to grant incentive and non-qualified Vornado stock
options, restricted stock, restricted Operating Partnership units and
out-performance plan awards to certain of our employees and officers.  Under
the Plan, awards may be granted up to a maximum of

6,000,000

Vornado shares, if all awards granted are Full Value
Awards, as defined, and up to

12,000,000

Vornado shares, if all of
the awards granted are Not Full Value Awards, as defined, plus shares in
respect of awards forfeited after May 2010 that were issued pursuant to Vornado’s
2002 Omnibus Share Plan.  Full Value Awards are awards of securities, such as Vornado
restricted shares, that, if all vesting requirements are met, do not require
the payment of an exercise price or strike price to acquire the securities. 
Not Full Value Awards are awards of securities, such as Vornado stock options,
that do require the payment of an exercise price or strike price.  This means,
for example, if the Committee were to award only Vornado restricted shares, it
could award up to 6,000,000 Vornado restricted shares.  On the other hand, if
the Committee were to award only Vornado stock options, it could award options
to purchase up to 12,000,000 Vornado common shares (at the applicable exercise
price).  The Committee may also issue any combination of awards under the Plan,
with reductions in availability of future awards made in accordance with the
above limitations.

As of December 31, 2016, Vornado has approximately

2,929,000

shares available for
future grants under the Plan, if all awards granted are Full Value Awards, as
defined.

In the years
ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized an aggregate of $

33,980,000

,
$

39,846,000

and $

36,641,000

, respectively, of
stock-based compensation expense, which is included as a component of “general
and administrative” expenses on our consolidated statements of income.

The year ended December 31, 2015 includes $

7,834

,000 from the acceleration
of the recognition of compensation expense related to 2013-2015 Out-Performance
Plans due to the modification of the vesting criteria of awards such that they
will fully vest at age 65.

The details of the various components of our
stock-based compensation are discussed on the following pages.

Compensation - continued

Out-Performance
Plans (“the OPPs”)

OPPs are multi-year, performance-based
equity compensation plans under which participants have the opportunity to earn
a class of units (“OPP units”) of the Operating Partnership if, and only if,
Vornado outperforms a predetermined total shareholder return (“TSR”) and/or
outperform the market with respect to a relative TSR in any year during the
requisite performance periods as described below.  OPP units, if earned, become
convertible into Class A units of the Operating Partnership (and ultimately
into Vornado common shares) following vesting.

Awards under the 2014 OPP have been
99.5% earned.  Awards under the 2015 and 2016 OPP may be earned if Vornado (i)
achieves a TSR level greater than 7% per annum, or 21% over the three-year
performance measurement periods (the “Absolute Component”), and/or (ii) achieves
a TSR above that of the SNL US REIT Index (“Index”) over the three-year
performance measurement periods (the “Relative Component”).  To the extent
awards would be earned under the Absolute Component of each of the OPPs, but
Vornado underperforms the Index, such awards would be reduced (and potentially
fully negated) based on the degree to which Vornado underperforms the
Index.  In certain circumstances, in the event Vornado outperforms the
Index but awards would not otherwise be fully earned under the Absolute
Component, awards may still be earned or increased under the Relative
Component.  To the extent awards would otherwise be earned under the
Relative Component but Vornado fails to achieve at least a 6% per annum
absolute TSR, such awards earned under the Relative Component would be reduced
based on Vornado’s absolute TSR, with no awards being earned in the event
Vornado’s TSR during the applicable measurement period is 0% or negative,
irrespective of the degree to which Vornado may outperform the
Index.  Dividends on awards issued and distributions on awards earned
accrue during the performance period.

If the designated performance objectives
are achieved, OPP units are also subject to time-based vesting requirements.
Awards earned under the OPPs vest 33.33% in each of years three, four and
five.  Vornado’s senior executive officers are required to hold earned 2016,
2015 and 2014 OPP awards (or related equity) for at least one year following
vesting.

during the years December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.

18.  Leases

As lessor:

We lease space to tenants under
operating leases. Most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base
rentals payable monthly in advance. Office building leases generally require
the tenants to reimburse us for operating costs and real estate taxes above
their base year costs. Certain leases provide for pass-through to tenants the
tenant’s share of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance. Certain leases
also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rent based on a
percentage of the tenants’ sales. As of December 31, 2016, future base rental
revenue under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding rents for leases with
an original term of less than one year and rents resulting from the exercise of
renewal options, are as follows:

1535 Broadway

We are a lessee under a long-term
capital lease for the retail and signage components of the Marriott Marquis
Times Square Hotel at 1535 Broadway.  At inception of the lease in 2012, we
recorded a $

240,000

,000 capital lease asset
and liability on our consolidated balance sheet based on the present value of
future minimum lease payments.  The capital lease asset is being depreciated on
a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset and the related
expense is included in “depreciation and amortization” on our consolidated
statements of income.  During 2016, we substantially completed the
redevelopment of the leased space, as required under the lease, at a total
redevelopment cost of approximately $

194,147

,000.  The lease contains a
put/call purchase option under which the lessor may exercise its “put” on
predetermined dates after March 31, 2018 and we may exercise our “call” at any
time after July 30, 2027 and before January 3, 2032.

As of  December 31, 2016, future

19.  Multiemployer Benefit Plans

Our subsidiaries make contributions to certain
multiemployer defined benefit plans (“Multiemployer Pension Plans”) and health
plans (“Multiemployer Health Plans”) for our union represented employees,
pursuant to the respective collective bargaining agreements.

Multiemployer Pension Plans

Multiemployer Pension Plans differ from single-employer
pension plans in that (i) contributions to multiemployer plans may be used to
provide benefits to employees of other participating employers and (ii) if
other participating employers fail to make their contributions, each of our
participating subsidiaries may be required to bear its then pro rata share of
unfunded obligations.  If a participating subsidiary withdraws from a plan in
which it participates, it may be subject to a withdrawal liability.  As of
December 31, 2016, our subsidiaries’ participation in these plans was
not significant to our consolidated financial statements.

In the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our
subsidiaries contributed $

9,479,000

, $

10,878,000

and $

11,431,000

, respectively, towards
Multiemployer Pension Plans, which is included as a component of “operating”
expenses on our consolidated statements of income.  Our subsidiaries’
contributions did not represent more than


% of total employer
contributions in any of these plans for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015
and 2014.

Multiemployer Health Plans

Multiemployer Health Plans in which our subsidiaries
participate provide health benefits to eligible active and retired employees. 
In the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our subsidiaries contributed
$

32,998,000

, $

29,269,000

and $

29,073,000

, respectively, towards these
plans, which is included as a component of “operating” expenses on our
consolidated statements of income.

20.  Commitments
and Contingencies

Insurance

We maintain general
liability insurance with limits of $

300,000

,000 per occurrence and per
property, and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $

2.0

billion per occurrence,
with sub-limits for certain perils such as flood and earthquake. Our California
properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $

180,000

,000 per occurrence and in
the annual aggregate, subject to a deductible in the amount of


% of the value of the
affected property. We maintain coverage for terrorism acts with limits of $

4.0

billion per occurrence and
in the aggregate, and $

2.0

billion per occurrence and
in the aggregate for terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and
radiological (“NBCR”) terrorism events, as defined by Terrorism Risk Insurance
Program Reauthorization Act of 2015, which expires in

December 2020

.

Penn
Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated
subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of all risk property
and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage,
and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism including NBCR acts.
Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by
third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to
PPIC. For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $

1,622

,000 ($

1,976

,000 for 2017) and


% (


% for 2017) of the balance
of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining
portion of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred
by PPIC.

We
continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs
of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage
will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future.

Our
debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which
are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements
contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we
believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these
agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at
reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage
than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our
properties and expand our portfolio.

20.  Commitments and Contingencies - continued

Other Commitments and Contingencies

We
are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course
of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome
of such matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Each
of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental
assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any
material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that
the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or
known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in
cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

Our
mortgage loans are non-recourse to us.  However, in certain cases we have
provided guarantees or master leased tenant space.  These guarantees and master
leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or
repayment of the underlying loans.  As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate
dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $

737,000

,000.

As of
December 31, 2016, $

19,847

,000 of letters of credit
was outstanding under one of our unsecured revolving credit facilities.  Our
unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require
us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market
capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a
decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities
also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including
representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default
that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure
to pay interest or principal.

As of
December 31, 2016, w

e expect to fu

nd
additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating
approximately $

173,000

,000, which includes our
share of the commitments of the Farley Post Office redevelopment joint venture.

As of December 31, 2016, we have construction commitments
aggregating $

653,940

,000.

Information – continued

Notes to preceding tabular
  information:

(1)

We
  calculate EBITDA on an Operating Partnership basis which is before allocation
  to the noncontrolling interest of the Operating Partnership. We consider
  EBITDA a non-GAAP financial measure for making decisions and assessing the
  unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on
  assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought
  and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to make
  investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to
  that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net
  income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by
  other companies.

Our
  7.5% interest in Fashion Centre Mall/Washington Tower will not be included in
  the spin-off of our Washington, DC segment and have been reclassified to
  Other. The prior year's presentation has been conformed to the current year.

24.  Subsequent Events

2017 Out-Performance Plan

On
January 13, 2017, the Committee approved the 2017 Outperformance Plan, a
multi-year, performance-based equity compensation plan (the “2017 OPP”).  Awards
under the 2017 OPP constitute awards under Vornado’s shareholder approved 2010
Omnibus Share Plan.  Under the 2017 OPP, participants have the opportunity to
earn compensation payable in the form of equity awards if, and only if, Vornado
outperforms a predetermined total shareholder return (“TSR”) and/or outperform
the market with respect to relative total TSR during a three-year performance
period.  Specifically, awards under our 2017 OPP may potentially be earned if
Vornado (i) achieves a TSR level greater than 7% per annum, or 21% over the
three-year performance period (the “Absolute Component”) and/or (ii) achieves a
TSR above that of the SNL US REIT Index (the “Index”) over a three-year
performance period (the “Relative Component”).  To the extent awards would be
earned under the Absolute Component but Vornado underperforms the Index, such
awards earned under the Absolute Component would be reduced (and potentially
fully negated) based on the degree to which Vornado underperforms the Index. 
In certain circumstances, in the event Vornado outperforms the Index but awards
would not otherwise be earned under the Absolute Component, awards may still be
earned under the Relative Component.  Moreover, to the extent awards would
otherwise be earned under the Relative Component but Vornado fails to achieve
at least a 3% per annum absolute TSR level, such awards earned under the
Relative Component would be reduced based on Vornado’s absolute TSR
performance, with no awards being earned in the event Vornado’s TSR during the
applicable measurement period is 0% or negative, irrespective of the degree to
which it may outperform the Index.  If the designated performance objectives
are achieved, OPP Units are also subject to time-based vesting requirements;

33.33

% in each of years three,
four and five.  Dividend payments on awards issued accrue during the
performance period and are paid to participants if, and only if, awards are
ultimately earned based on the achievement of the designated performance objectives. 
In addition, all of Vornado’s senior executive officers are required to hold
any earned OPP awards (or related equity) for at least one year following
vesting.

Vornado

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures:  Our management, with the participation of Vornado’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is
defined in Rule 13a‑15 (e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, Vornado’s Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our
disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting:  There have not been any changes in our
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year to which this report relates that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management
of Vornado Realty Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the
“Company”), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed under the supervision of Vornado’s principal executive
and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial
statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As of
December 31, 2016, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
this assessment, management has determined that our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 was effective.

Our
internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable
assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our trustees; and
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a
material effect on our financial statements.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2016 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on the
following page, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.


REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board of Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We have audited the internal control over financial
reporting of Vornado Realty Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries
(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying

Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, and effected by the company’s board of trustees, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control
over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud
may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2016, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2016 of the Company and our report dated February 13, 2017
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial
statement schedules.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December

REPORT OF

Partners

Vornado Realty L.P.

New York, New York

We have audited the internal control over financial
reporting of Vornado Realty L.P. and consolidated subsidiaries (the
“Partnership”) as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management of Vornado Realty Trust,
sole general partner of the Partnership, is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, and effected by the company’s board of trustees, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and trustees of Vornado Realty Trust; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control
over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud
may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Partnership maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2016, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2016 of the Partnership and our report dated February 13,
