at December 31, 2012.  All references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and

Objectives
and Strategy

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value.
We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment
philosophy and executing our operating strategies through:

·

Maintaining
a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an
entrepreneurial spirit;

·

Investing
in properties in select markets, such as New York City and
Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital
appreciation;

·

Acquiring
quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a
significant potential for higher rents;

·

Investing
in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;

·

Developing
and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize
value; and

·

Investing in operating companies
that have a significant real estate component.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and
investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset
sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets.  We may also
offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in
exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these
securities in the future.

VorNADO CAPITAL
PARTNERS REAL ESTATE FUND (The “FUND”)

In February 2011, the Fund’s subscription
period closed with an aggregate of $800,000,000 of capital commitments, of
which we committed $200,000,000.  We are the general partner and investment
manager of the Fund, which has an eight-year term and a three-year investment
period.  During the investment period, which concludes in July 2013, the Fund
is our exclusive investment vehicle for all investments that fit within its
investment parameters, including debt, equity and other interests in real
estate, and excluding (i) investments in vacant land and ground-up development;
(ii) investments acquired by merger or primarily for our securities or
properties; (iii) properties which can be combined with or relate to our
existing properties; (iv) securities of commercial mortgage loan servicers and
investments derived from any such investments; (v) non-controlling interests in
equity and debt securities; and (vi) investments located outside of North
America.   The Fund’s investments are reported on its balance sheet at fair
value, with changes in value each period recognized in earnings.  We
consolidate the accounts of the Fund into our consolidated financial statements,
retaining the fair value basis of accounting.

During 2012, the
Fund made four investments (described below) aggregating $203,700,000.  As of
December 31, 2012, the Fund has nine investments with an aggregate fair value of
$600,786,000, or $67,642,000 in excess of cost, and has remaining unfunded
commitments of $217,676,000, of which our share was $54,419,000.

800 Corporate Pointe

On November 30,
2012, the Fund acquired 800 Corporate Pointe, a 243,000 square foot office
building and the accompanying six-level parking structure (1,964 spaces)
located in Culver City, Los Angeles, California, for $95,700,000 in cash.

501 Broadway

On August 20,
2012, the Fund acquired 501 Broadway, a 9,000 square foot retail property in
New York for $31,000,000.  The purchase price consisted of $11,000,000 in
cash and a $20,000,000 mortgage loan.  The three-year loan bears interest
at LIBOR plus 2.75%, with a floor of 3.50%, and has two one-year extension
options.

1100 Lincoln Road

On July 2, 2012,
the Fund acquired 1100 Lincoln Road, a 167,000 square foot retail property, the
western anchor of the Lincoln Road Shopping District in Miami Beach, Florida,
for $132,000,000.  The purchase price consisted of $66,000,000 in cash and
a $66,000,000 mortgage loan.  The three-year loan bears interest at LIBOR
plus 2.75% and has two one-year extension options.

520 Broadway

On April 26,
2012, the Fund acquired 520 Broadway, a 112,000 square foot office building in
Santa Monica, California for $61,000,000 in cash and subsequently placed a
$30,000,000 mortgage loan on the property.  The three-year loan bears
interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% and has two one-year extension options.


ACQUISITIONS and
investments

Independence Plaza

In 2011, we acquired a 51% interest in the
subordinated debt of Independence Plaza, a three-building 1,328 unit
residential complex in the Tribeca submarket of Manhattan which has 54,500
square feet of retail space and 550 parking spaces, for $45,000,000 and a
warrant to purchase 25% of the equity for $1,000,000.  On December 21, 2012, we
acquired a 58.75% interest in the property as follows: (i) buying one of the
equity partners’ 33.75% interest for $160,000,000, (ii) exercising our warrant
for 25% of the equity and (iii) contributing the appreciated value of our
interest in the subordinated debt as preferred equity.  In connection therewith,
we recognized income of $105,366,000, comprised of $60,396,000 from the
accelerated amortization of the discount on the subordinated debt immediately
preceding the conversion to preferred equity, and a $44,970,000 purchase price
fair value adjustment upon exercising the warrant.  The current transaction
values the property at $844,800,000.  The property is currently encumbered by a
$334,225,000 mortgage.  We expect to refinance the $334,225,000 mortgage
in 2013, substantially decreasing our cash investment.  We manage the
retail space at the property and Stellar Management, our partner, manages the
residential space.

Fifth Avenue - Retail

On December 6, 2012, we acquired a retail condominium
located at 666 Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street for $707,000,000 in cash. The
property has 126 feet of frontage on Fifth Avenue and contains 114,000 square
feet, 39,000 square feet in fee and 75,000 square feet by long-term lease from
the 666 Fifth Avenue office condominium, which is 49.5% owned by us.

Marriott
Marquis Times Square - Retail and Signage

On July 30, 2012, we entered into a lease with Host
Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE: HST) (“Host”), under which we will redevelop
the retail and signage components of the Marriott Marquis Times Square
Hotel.  The Marriott Marquis with over 1,900 rooms is one of the largest
hotels in Manhattan.  It is located in the heart of the bow-tie of Times
Square and spans the entire block front from 45th Street to 46th Street on
Broadway.  The Marriott Marquis is directly across from our
1540 Broadway iconic retail property leased to Forever 21 and Disney
flagship stores.  We plan to spend over $140,000,000 to redevelop and
substantially expand the existing retail space, including converting the below
grade parking garage into retail, and creating six-story, 300 foot wide block
front, dynamic LED signs.  During the term of the lease we will pay fixed
rent equal to the sum of $12,500,000, plus a portion of the property’s net cash
flow after we receive a 5.2% preferred return on our invested capital. 
The lease contains put/call options which, if exercised, would lead to our
ownership.  Host can exercise the put option during defined periods following
the conversion of the project to a condominium.  We can exercise our call
option under the same terms, at any time after the fifteenth year of the lease
term.

Cuyahoga County, Ohio (the “County”) to develop and operate the Cleveland
Medical Mart and Convention Center (the “Facility”), a 1,000,000 square foot
showroom, trade show and conference center in Cleveland’s central business
district.  The County is funding the development of the Facility, using the
proceeds it received from the issuance of general obligation bonds and other
sources, up to the development budget of $418,000,000 and maintains effective
control of the property.  During the 17-year development and operating period,
our subsidiaries will receive net settled payments of approximately $10,000,000
per year, which are net of a $36,000,000 annual obligation to the County.  Our subsidiaries’
obligation has been pledged by the County to the bondholders, but is payable by
our subsidiaries only to the extent that they first receive at least an equal
payment from the County.  Construction of the Facility is expected to be
completed in 2013.  As of December 31, 2012, $379,658,000 of the $418,000,000
development budget was expended.

There
can be no assurance that any of our development or redevelopment projects will
commence, or if commenced, be completed on schedule or within budget.

sTop & SHop settlement

On February 6, 2013, we received $124,000,000 pursuant
to a settlement agreement with Stop & Shop for our claim under a 1992
agreement which provided for additional annual rent of $6,000,000 for a period
potentially through 2031.  The settlement terminates our right to receive this
rent under the 1992 agreement and ends litigation between the parties, which
started ten years ago.  In prior years, we recognized $47,900,000 of rental
income under the agreement.  This settlement will result in $59,000,000 of net
income that will be recognized in the first quarter of 2013.


SEGMENT
DATA

We operate in the following business segments: New
York, Washington, DC, Retail Properties, Merchandise Mart and Toys “R” Us
(“Toys”).  Financial information related to these business segments for the
years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 is set forth in Note 26 – Segment
Information to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.  The Toys segment has 651 locations internationally.

SEASONALITY

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality
during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from
operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the current quarter to the
previous quarter. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys’
fourth quarter net income, which we record on a one-quarter lag basis in our
first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. The
New York and Washington, DC segments have historically experienced higher
utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year.  The Retail
Properties segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the
recognition of percentage and specialty rental income.

tenants ACCOUNTING
FOR over 10% of revenues

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of
total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Certain Activities

We do not base our acquisitions and investments on
specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our
properties for long‑term investment; however, it is possible that
properties in the portfolio may be sold as circumstances warrant. Further, we
have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which
could be invested in a specific property or property type. While we may seek
the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material
transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time
to time by our Board of Trustees without the vote of shareholders.

Employees

As of December 31, 2012, we have approximately 4,428
employees, of which 327 are corporate staff. The New York segment has 3,308
employees, including 2,641 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a
wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering
services primarily to our New York and Washington, DC properties and 516
employees at the Hotel Pennsylvania. The Washington, DC, Retail Properties and
Merchandise Mart segments have 456, 110 and 227 employees, respectively. The
foregoing does not include employees of partially owned entities, including
Toys or Alexander’s, of which we own 32.6% and 32.4%,

respectively.

principal executive offices

Our principal executive offices are located at 888
Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019; telephone (212) 894‑7000.

ITEM
1A.     RISK FACTORS

Material factors that may adversely affect our
business, operations and financial condition are summarized below.  The risks
and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones we face. 
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we
currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.  See
“Forward-Looking Statements” contained herein on page 3.

Real Estate
Investments’ Value and Income Fluctuate Due to Various Factors.

The value of real estate fluctuates depending on
conditions in the general economy and the real estate business. These
conditions may also adversely impact our revenues and cash flows.

The factors that affect the value of our real
estate investments include, among other things:

·

national,
regional and local economic conditions;

·

competition
from other available space;

·

local
conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real
estate in the area;

·

how
well we manage our properties;

·

the development and/or redevelopment of our properties;

·

changes
in market rental rates;

·

the
timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;

·

whether
we are able to pass all or portions of any increases in operating costs through
to tenants;

·

changes
in real estate taxes and other expenses;

·

whether
tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property
attractive;

·

the
financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies
or defaults;

·

availability
of financing on acceptable terms or at all;

·

fluctuations
in interest rates;

·

our
ability to obtain adequate insurance;

·

changes
in zoning laws and taxation;

·

government
regulation;

·

consequences
of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attacks against, the United
States;

·

potential
liability under environmental or other laws or regulations;

·

natural disasters;

·

general
competitive factors; and

·

climate changes.

The rents or sales proceeds we receive and the
occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes
in any of these factors. If rental revenues, sales proceeds and/or occupancy
levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available to pay
indebtedness and for distribution to shareholders. In addition, some of our
major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance
costs generally do not decline when the related rents decline.

Capital markets and
economic conditions can materially affect our financial condition and results
of operations and the value of our debt and equity securities.

There are many factors that can affect the value
of our debt and equity securities, including the state of the capital markets
and the economy, which over the past few years have negatively affected
substantially all businesses, including ours.  Demand for office and retail
space may decline nationwide as it did in 2008 and 2009, due to bankruptcies,
downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting.  Government action or inaction may
adversely affect the state of the capital markets.  The cost and availability
of credit may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit
spreads, which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and
the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants.  Our inability or the
inability of our tenants to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access
the capital markets to meet liquidity needs may materially affect our financial
condition and results of operations and the value of our debt and equity
securities.


Real
estate is a competitive business.

Our business segments – New York, Washington, DC,
Retail Properties, Merchandise Mart and Toys – operate in a highly competitive
environment. We have a large concentration of properties in the New York City
metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area. We
compete with a large number of property owners and developers, some of which
may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments than we are.
Principal factors of competition include rents charged, sales prices,
attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and
quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors,
trends of the national, regional and local economies, financial condition and operating
results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost
of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulation,
legislation and population trends.

We depend on leasing space
to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from tenants who
may not be able to pay.

Our financial results depend significantly on
leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms. In
addition, because a majority of our income comes from renting of real property,
our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and funds available for
distribution to shareholders will decrease if a significant number of our
tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain occupancy
levels on favorable terms. If a tenant does not pay its rent, we may not be
able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial
legal costs.  During periods of economic adversity, there may be an increase in
the number of tenants that cannot pay their rent and an increase in vacancy
rates.

Bankruptcy or insolvency of
tenants may decrease our revenue, net income and available cash.

From time to time, some of our tenants have
declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become
insolvent in the future. In the case of our shopping centers, the bankruptcy or
insolvency of a major tenant could cause us to suffer lower revenues and
operational difficulties, including leasing the remainder of the property. As a
result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could result in
decreased revenue, net income and funds available for the payment of
indebtedness or for distribution to shareholders.

We may incur costs to
comply with environmental laws.

Our operations and properties are subject to
various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection
of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic
substances and health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or
previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and
clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or
operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties
for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up
costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination. These laws often
impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the
release of the substances or caused the release. The presence of contamination
or the failure to remediate contamination may impair our ability to sell or
lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other laws
and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can
require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event
of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of
and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. The maintenance and removal of lead
paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) and underground storage tanks are also regulated by federal and state
laws. We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical
or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which,
above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other
health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. Our predecessor
companies may be subject to similar liabilities for activities of those companies
in the past.  We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held
liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated
substances or tanks or related claims arising out of environmental
contamination or human exposure to contamination at or from our properties.

Each of our properties has been subject to varying
degrees of environmental assessment. The environmental assessments did not, as
of this date, reveal any environmental condition material to our business.
However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of
contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, discovery
of additional sites, human exposure to the contamination or changes in clean-up
or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us.


Inflation or deflation may
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Although neither inflation nor deflation has
materially impacted our operations in the recent past, increased inflation
could have a pronounced negative impact on our mortgages and interest rates and
general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate
higher than our rents.  Inflation could also have an adverse effect on consumer
spending which could impact our tenants’ sales and, in turn, our percentage
rents, where applicable.  Conversely, deflation could lead to downward pressure
on rents and other sources of income.  In addition, we own residential
properties which are leased to tenants with one-year lease terms.  Because
these are short-term leases, declines in market rents will impact our
residential properties faster than if the leases were for longer terms.

Some of our potential
losses may not be covered by insurance.

We maintain general liability insurance with
limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all risk property and rental value
insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, including coverage for
terrorist acts, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods.  Our
California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $180,000,000
per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the
affected property, up to a $180,000,000 annual aggregate.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our
wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to all
risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake
insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism,
including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as
defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. Coverage
for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party
insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. 
Coverage for NBCR losses is up to $2.0 billion per occurrence, for which PPIC
is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and 15% of the balance of a
covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of
a covered loss.  We are ultimately responsible for any loss borne by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance
market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we
cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable
terms in future policy years.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage
loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured
notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us
to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance
coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an
equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if
lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could
adversely affect our ability to finance our properties and expand our
portfolio.

Because we operate a hotel, we face the risks associated
with the hospitality industry.

We own and operate the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City. The following factors, among others, are common to the hotel industry and
may reduce the revenues generated by the hotel, which would reduce cash
available for distribution to our shareholders:

·

our hotel competes for guests with other hotels, a number
of which have greater marketing and financial resources;

·

if there is an increase in operating costs resulting from
inflation and other factors, we may not be able to offset such increase by
increasing room rates;

·

our hotel is subject to the fluctuating and seasonal
demands of business travelers and tourism;

·

our hotel is subject to general and local economic and
social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, including war
and terrorism; and

·

physical condition, which may require
substantial additional capital.

Because
of the ownership structure of the Hotel Pennsylvania, we face potential adverse
effects from changes to the applicable tax laws.

Under the Internal Revenue Code, REITs like us are
not allowed to operate hotels directly or indirectly. Accordingly, we lease the
Hotel Pennsylvania to our taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”). While the TRS
structure allows the economic benefits of ownership to flow to us, the TRS is
subject to tax on its income from the operations of the hotel at the federal
and state level. In addition, the TRS is subject to detailed tax regulations
that affect how it may be capitalized and operated. If the tax laws applicable
to a TRS are modified, we may be forced to modify the structure for owning the
hotel, and such changes may adversely affect the cash flows from the hotel. In
addition, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department
and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, and we cannot
predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations,
interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any such actions may prospectively
or retroactively modify the tax treatment of the TRS and, therefore, may
adversely affect our after-tax returns from the hotel.


Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with
Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in
substantial costs.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”)
generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, meet
certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. 
Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government
or the award of damages to private litigants and/or legal fees to their
counsel.  From time to time persons have asserted claims against us with
respect to some of our properties under the ADA, but to date such claims have
not resulted in any material expense or liability.  If, under the ADA, we are
required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or
more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as
the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders.

Our properties are subject to various federal,
state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life
safety requirements.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could
incur fines or private damage awards.  We do not know whether existing
requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will
require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow
and results of operations.

We face risks associated with our tenants
being designated “Prohibited Persons” by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.

Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws,
the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the
Treasury (“OFAC”) maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who
are otherwise blocked or banned (“Prohibited Persons”) from conducting business
or engaging in transactions in the United States.  Our leases, loans and other
agreements may require us to comply with OFAC requirements.  If a tenant or
other party with whom we conduct business is placed on the OFAC list we may be
required to terminate the lease or other agreement.  Any such termination could
result in a loss of revenue or otherwise negatively affect our financial
results and cash flows.

Our business and operations would suffer in
the event of system failures.

Despite system redundancy, the implementation of
security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our
internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages
from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access,
energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication
failures.  Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our
operations could result in a material disruption to our business.  We may also
incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions.

The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a
deficiency in our cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by
causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our
confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships, all of which
could negatively impact our financial results.

A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse
event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our
information resources. More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack
or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to
systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or steal confidential information.
As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our
systems, both internal and those we have outsourced. Our three primary risks
that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include
operational interruption, damage to our relationship with our tenants, and
private data exposure.  We have implemented processes, procedures and controls to
help mitigate these risks, but these measures, as well as our increased
awareness of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that our financial
results will not be negatively impacted by such an incident.


Our
Investments Are Concentrated in the New York CITY METROPOLITAN AREA and
Washington, DC / NORTHERN VIRGINIA Area. Circumstances Affecting These Areas
Generally Could Adversely Affect Our Business.

A
significant portion of our properties are located in the New York City / New
Jersey metropolitan area and Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area and are
affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent to those areas.

In 2012, approximately 74% of our EBITDA,
excluding items that affect comparability, came from properties located in the
New York City metropolitan areas and the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia
area.  We may continue to concentrate a significant portion of our future
acquisitions in these areas or in other geographic real estate markets in the
United States or abroad.  Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns
and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact these markets in
either the short or long term. Declines in the economy or declines in real
estate markets in these areas could hurt our financial performance and the
value of our properties.  In addition to the factors affecting the national
economic condition generally, the factors affecting economic conditions in
these regions include:

·

financial
performance and productivity of the publishing, advertising, financial,
technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries;

·

space
needs of, and budgetary constraints affecting, the United States Government,
including the effect of a deficit reduction plan and/or base closures and
repositioning under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 2005, as
amended;

·

business
layoffs or downsizing;

·

industry
slowdowns;

·

relocations
of businesses;

·

changing
demographics;

·

increased
telecommuting and use of alternative work places;

·

infrastructure
quality; and

·

any
oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.

It is impossible for us to assess the future
effects of trends in the economic and investment climates of the geographic
areas in which we concentrate, and more generally of the United States, or the
real estate markets in these areas.  Local, national or global economic
downturns, would negatively affect our businesses and profitability.

Terrorist
attacks, such as those of September 11, 2001 in New York City and the Washington,   DC area, may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to
generate cash flow.

We have significant investments in large
metropolitan areas, including the New York, Washington, DC and San Francisco metropolitan areas. In the aftermath of a terrorist attack, tenants in these
areas may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile
areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of
future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize
businesses in these areas. This, in turn, would trigger a decrease in the
demand for space in these areas, which could increase vacancies in our
properties and force us to lease space on less favorable terms. As a result,
the value of our properties and the level of our revenues and cash flows could
decline materially.

Natural
Disasters could have a concentrated impact on the areas where we operate and
could adversely impact our results.

We have significant investments in large
metropolitan areas, including the New York, Washington, DC and San Francisco
metropolitan areas.  As much of our investments are concentrated along the
Eastern Seaboard, natural disasters, such as those resulting from Superstorm
Sandy, could impact several of our properties.  Additionally, natural
disasters, including earthquakes, could impact several of our properties in
other areas in which we operate.  Potentially adverse consequences of “global
warming” could similarly have an impact on our properties.  As a result, we
could become subject to significant losses and/or repair costs that may or may
not be fully covered by insurance and to the risk of business interruption. 
The incurrence of these losses, costs or business interruptions may adversely
affect our operating and financial results.


We
May Acquire or Sell Assets or Entities or Develop Properties. Our Failure
or Inability to Consummate These Transactions or Manage the Results of These
Transactions Could Adversely Affect Our Operations and Financial Results.

We have
grown substantially since 2002 through acquisitions. We may not be able to
maintain this growth and our failure to do so could adversely affect our stock
price.

We have grown substantially since 2002, increasing
our total assets from approximately $9.0 billion at December 31, 2002 to
approximately $22.0 billion at December 31, 2012. We may not be able to
maintain a similar rate of growth in the future or manage growth effectively.
Our failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations as well as the amount of cash available for
distributions to shareholders.

We may
acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies
and this may create risks.

We may acquire or develop properties or acquire
other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or
development is consistent with our business strategy. We may not, however,
succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on
time or within budget. In addition, we may face competition in pursuing
acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. When we
do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing or selling
newly-developed or acquired properties at rents or sales prices sufficient to
cover costs of acquisition or development and operations.  Difficulties in
integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert
management’s attention. Acquisitions or developments in new markets or
industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result
in weaker than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition or
development opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to
recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter
not consummated. Furthermore, acquisitions of new properties or companies will
expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we
may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. Development of our existing
properties presents similar risks.

From time to time we have
made, and in the future we may seek to make, one or more material
acquisitions.  The announcement of such a material acquisition may result in a
rapid and significant decline in the price of our common shares.

We are continuously looking at material
transactions that we believe will maximize shareholder value.  However, an
announcement by us of one or more significant acquisitions could result in a
quick and significant decline in the price of our common shares.

It may be difficult to buy
and sell real estate quickly, which may limit our flexibility.

Real estate investments are relatively difficult
to buy and sell quickly. Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary our
portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.

We may
not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the debt
associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so
without incurring additional costs.  In addition, when we dispose of or sell
assets, we may not be able to reinvest the sales proceeds and earn similar
returns.

As part of an acquisition of a property, or a
portfolio of properties, we may agree, and in the past have agreed, not to
dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness for a
long-term period, unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the
seller. These agreements could result in us holding on to properties that we
would otherwise sell and not pay down or refinance.  In addition, when we
dispose of or sell assets, we may not be able to reinvest the sales proceeds
and earn returns similar to those generated by the assets that were sold.

From
time to time we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole
control. Some of these companies operate in industries that differ from our
current operations, with different risks than investing in real estate.

From time to time we make debt or equity investments
in other companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole
control. These investments include but are not limited
to, Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”), Toys “R” Us (“Toys”),
Lexington Realty Trust (“Lexington”), J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (“J.C.
Penney”), and other equity and mezzanine investments. Although these businesses
generally have a significant real estate component, some of them operate in
businesses that are different from our primary lines of business including, without
limitation, operating or managing toy stores and department stores.
Consequently, investments in these businesses, among other risks, subjects us
to the operating and financial risks of industries other than real estate and
to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these
businesses. From time to time we may make additional investments in or acquire
other entities that may subject us to similar risks. Investments in entities
over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures, present
additional risks such as having differing objectives than our partners or the
entities in which we invest, or becoming involved in disputes, or competing
with those persons.  In addition, we rely on the internal controls and
financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain
effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may adversely affect us.


We are
subject to risks that affect the general retail environment.

A substantial portion of our properties are in the
retail shopping center real estate market and we have a significant investment
in retailers such as Toys and J.C. Penney. This means that we are subject to
factors that affect the retail environment generally, including the level of
consumer spending and consumer confidence, the threat of terrorism and
increasing competition from discount retailers, outlet malls, retail websites
and catalog companies. These factors could adversely affect the financial
condition of our retail tenants and the retailers in which we hold an
investment and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping
centers, and in turn, adversely affect us.

Our investment in Toys subjects us to risks that are
different from our other lines of business and may result in increased
seasonality and volatility in our reported earnings.

Because Toys is a retailer, its operations subject
us to the risks of a retail company that are different than those presented by
our other lines of business. The business of Toys is highly seasonal.
Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its
fiscal year net income. In addition, our fiscal year ends on December 31
whereas, as is common for retailers, Toys’ fiscal year ends on the Saturday
nearest to January 31. Therefore, we record our pro rata share of Toys’
net earnings on a one-quarter lag basis. For example, our financial results for
the year ended December 31, 2012 include Toys’ financial results for its first,
second and third quarters ended October 29, 2012, as well as Toys’ fourth
quarter results of 2011. Because of the seasonality of Toys, our reported
quarterly net income shows increased volatility. We may also, in the future and
from time to time, invest in other businesses that may report financial results
that are more volatile than our historical financial results.

We
depend upon our anchor tenants to attract shoppers.

We own several regional malls and other shopping
centers that are typically anchored by well-known department stores and other tenants
who generate shopping traffic at the mall or shopping center. The value of our
properties would be adversely affected if tenants or anchors failed to meet
their contractual obligations, sought concessions in order to continue
operations or ceased their operations, including as a result of bankruptcy. If
the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly
due to economic conditions, closing of anchors or for other reasons, tenants
may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the
event of a default by a tenant or anchor, we may experience delays and costs in
enforcing our rights as landlord.

Our decision to dispose of real estate
assets would change the holding period assumption in our valuation analyses,
which could result in material impairment losses and adversely affect our
financial results.

We evaluate
real estate assets for impairment based on the projected cash flow of the asset
over our anticipated holding period.  If we change our intended holding period,
due to our intention to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset, then under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we
must reevaluate whether that asset is impaired.  Depending on the carrying
value of the property at the time we change our intention and the amount that
we estimate we would receive on disposal, we may record an impairment loss that
would adversely affect our financial results. This loss could be material to
our results of operations in the period that it is recognized.

We
invest in mortgage loans and subordinated or mezzanine debt of certain entities
that have significant real estate assets.

We invest, and may in the future invest, in
mortgage loans and subordinated or mezzanine debt of certain entities that have
significant real estate assets.  These investments are either secured by the
real property or by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the
underlying real estate.  If a borrower defaults on debt to us or on debt senior
to us, or declares bankruptcy, we may not be able to recover some or all of our
investment.  In addition, there may be significant delays and costs associated
with the process of foreclosing on collateral securing or supporting these
investments.  The value of the assets securing or supporting our investments
could deteriorate over time due to factors beyond our control, including acts
or omissions by owners, changes in business, economic or market conditions, or
foreclosure.  Such deteriorations in value may result in the recognition of
impairment losses and/or valuation allowances on our statements of income.  As
of December 31, 2012, our investments in mortgage and mezzanine debt securities
have an aggregate carrying amount of $225,359,000.


We evaluate the
collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate such amounts may not be
recoverable.  A loan is impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to
collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a
loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the
carrying amount of the investment to the present value of expected future cash
flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or as a practical
expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. 
There can be no assurance that our estimates of collectible amounts will not
change over time or that they will be representative of the amounts we will
actually collect, including amounts we would collect if we chose to sell these
investments before their maturity.  If we collect less than our estimates, we
will record impairment losses which could be material.

We
invest in marketable equity securities.  The value of these investments may
decline as a result of operating performance or economic or market conditions.

We invest in marketable equity securities of
publicly-traded companies, such as J.C. Penney.  As of December 31, 2012, our
marketable securities have an aggregate carrying amount of $398,188,000, at
market.  Significant declines in the value of these investments due to, among
other reasons, operating performance or economic or market conditions, may
result in the recognition of impairment losses which could be material.

Our Organizational and
Financial Structure Gives Rise to Operational and Financial Risks.

We may not be able to
obtain capital to make investments.

We depend primarily on external financing to fund
the growth of our business. This is because one of the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for a REIT is that it distributes
90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its shareholders.
There is a separate requirement to distribute net capital gains or pay a
corporate level tax in lieu thereof. Our access to debt or equity financing
depends on the willingness of third parties to lend or make equity investments
and on conditions in the capital markets generally. Although we believe that we
will be able to finance any investments we may wish to make in the foreseeable
future, there can be no assurance that new financing will be available or
available on acceptable terms.  For information about our available sources of
funds, see

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources”

and the notes to
the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Vornado
Realty Trust (“Vornado”) depends on dividends and distributions from its direct
and indirect subsidiaries. The creditors and preferred security holders of
these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries
before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to Vornado.

Substantially all of Vornado’s assets are held
through its Operating Partnership that holds substantially all of its
properties and assets through subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership’s cash
flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by its subsidiaries, and in turn,
substantially all of Vornado’s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to
it by the Operating Partnership. The creditors of each of Vornado’s direct and
indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations
to them, when due and payable, before distributions may be made by that
subsidiary to its equity holders. Thus, the Operating Partnership’s ability to
make distributions to holders of its units depends on its subsidiaries’ ability
first to satisfy their obligations to their creditors and then to make
distributions to the Operating Partnership. Likewise, Vornado’s ability to pay
dividends to holders of common and preferred shares depends on the Operating
Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and
make distributions payable to holders of preferred units and then to make
distributions to Vornado.

Furthermore, the holders of preferred units of the
Operating Partnership are entitled to receive preferred distributions before
payment of distributions to holders of Class A units of the Operating
Partnership, including Vornado. Thus, Vornado’s ability to pay cash dividends
to its shareholders and satisfy its debt obligations depends on the Operating Partnership’s
ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make
distributions to holders of its preferred units and then to holders of its
Class A units, including Vornado.  As of December 31, 2012, there were four
series of preferred units of the Operating Partnership not held by Vornado with
a total liquidation value of $101,095,000.

In addition, Vornado’s participation in any
distribution of the assets of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries upon
the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency, is only after the claims of the
creditors, including trade creditors and preferred security holders, are
satisfied.


We have
outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may increase and refinancing
may not be available on acceptable terms.

As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $14.7
billion of total debt outstanding, including our pro rata share of debt of
partially owned entities, and excluding $25.4 billion for our pro rata share of
LNR’s liabilities related to its consolidated CMBS and CDO trusts, which are
non-recourse to LNR and its equity holders, including us.  Our ratio of total
debt to total enterprise value was approximately 46%. When we say “enterprise
value” in the preceding sentence, we mean market equity value of our common and
preferred securities plus total debt outstanding, including our pro rata share
of debt of partially owned entities, and excluding LNR’s liabilities related to
its consolidated CMBS and CDO trusts.  In the future, we may incur additional debt
to finance acquisitions or property developments and thus increase our ratio of
total debt to total enterprise value. If our level of indebtedness increases,
there may be an increased risk of a credit rating downgrade or a default on our
obligations that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations. In addition, in a rising interest rate environment, the cost of
existing variable rate debt and any new debt or other market rate security or
instrument may increase.  Furthermore, we may not be able to refinance existing
indebtedness in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms.

Covenants
in our debt instruments could adversely affect our financial condition and our
acquisitions and development activities.

The mortgages on our properties contain customary
covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of
the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue
insurance coverage. Our unsecured credit facilities, unsecured debt securities
and other loans that we may obtain in the future contain, or may contain,
customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to
incur indebtedness, including covenants that limit our ability to incur debt
based upon the level of our ratio of total debt to total assets, our ratio of
secured debt to total assets, our ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, and
fixed charges, and that require us to maintain a certain level of unencumbered
assets to unsecured debt. Our ability to borrow is subject to compliance with
these and other covenants. In addition, failure to comply with our covenants
could cause a default under the applicable debt instrument, and we may then be
required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those
circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or may be
available only on unattractive terms.

We rely on debt financing, including borrowings
under our unsecured credit facilities, issuances of unsecured debt securities
and debt secured by individual properties, to finance acquisitions and
development activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt
financing from these or other sources, or refinance existing indebtedness upon
maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be
adversely affected. If we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders
can declare a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of the
property securing the defaulted loan.

Vornado may fail to qualify
or remain qualified as a REIT and may be required to pay income taxes at
corporate rates.

Although we believe that we will remain organized
and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes, we may fail to remain qualified in this way. Qualification as a REIT
for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and complex
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited
judicial or administrative interpretations. Our qualification as a REIT also
depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our
control. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative
interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with
respect to the requirements for qualification as a REIT or the federal income
tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT.

If, with respect to any taxable year, we fail to
maintain our qualification as a REIT and do not qualify under statutory relief
provisions, we could not deduct distributions to shareholders in computing our
taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on our taxable income
at regular corporate rates. The federal income tax payable would include any
applicable alternative minimum tax. If we had to pay federal income tax, the
amount of money available to distribute to shareholders and pay our
indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved, and we would no
longer be required to make distributions to shareholders. In addition, we would
also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years
following the year during which qualification was lost, unless we were entitled
to relief under the relevant statutory provisions. Although we currently intend
to operate in a manner designed to allow us to qualify as a REIT, future
economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause us to revoke the
REIT election or fail to qualify as a REIT.


We face possible adverse changes in tax laws, which may
result in an increase in our tax liability.

From time to time changes in state and local tax
laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax
liability. The shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in
recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes.
If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets
or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for
payment of dividends.

Loss of
our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of
our common shares.

We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth,
the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Vornado, and Michael D. Fascitelli,
the President and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado. While we believe that we
could find replacements for these and other key personnel, the loss of their
services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common
shares.

Vornado’s
charter documents and applicable law may hinder any attempt to acquire us.

Our Amended and Restated
Declaration of Trust sets limits on the ownership of our shares.

Generally, for Vornado to maintain its
qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% in
value of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of Vornado may be owned,
directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the
last half of Vornado’s taxable year. The Internal Revenue Code defines
“individuals” for purposes of the requirement described in the preceding
sentence to include some types of entities. Under Vornado’s Amended and
Restated Declaration of Trust, as amended, no person may own more than 6.7% of
the outstanding common shares of any class, or 9.9% of the outstanding
preferred shares of any class, with some exceptions for persons who held common
shares in excess of the 6.7% limit before Vornado adopted the limit and other
persons approved by Vornado’s Board of Trustees. These restrictions on
transferability and ownership may delay, deter or prevent a change in control
of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise
be in the best interest of the shareholders. We refer to Vornado’s Amended and
Restated Declaration of Trust, as amended, as the “declaration of trust.”

Vornado has a classified Board of Trustees and that may
reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Vornado’s Board of Trustees is divided into three
classes of trustees. Trustees of each class are chosen for three-year staggered
terms. Staggered terms of trustees may reduce the possibility of a tender offer
or an attempt to change control of Vornado, even though a tender offer or
change in control might be in the best interest of Vornado’s shareholders.

We may issue additional
shares in a manner that could adversely affect the likelihood of certain
takeover transactions.

Vornado’s declaration of trust authorizes the
Board of Trustees to:

·

cause
Vornado to issue additional authorized but unissued common shares or preferred
shares;

·

classify
or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred shares;

·

set
the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified
shares that Vornado issues; and

·

increase,
without shareholder approval, the number of shares of beneficial interest that
Vornado may issue.

The Board of Trustees could establish a series of
preferred shares whose terms could delay, deter or prevent a change in control
of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise
be in the best interest of Vornado’s shareholders, although the Board of
Trustees does not now intend to establish a series of preferred shares of this
kind. Vornado’s declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that
may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado or other transaction
that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our
shareholders.


The Maryland
General Corporation Law contains provisions that may reduce the likelihood of
certain takeover transactions.

Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, as
amended, which we refer to as the “MGCL,” as applicable to REITs, certain
“business combinations,” including certain mergers, consolidations, share
exchanges and asset transfers and certain issuances and reclassifications of
equity securities, between a Maryland REIT and any person who beneficially owns
ten percent or more of the voting power of the trust’s shares or an affiliate
or an associate, as defined in the MGCL, of the trust who, at any time within
the two-year period before the date in question, was the beneficial owner of
ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting shares
of beneficial interest of the trust, which we refer to as an “interested
shareholder,” or an affiliate of the interested shareholder, are prohibited for
five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder
becomes an interested shareholder. After that five-year period, any business
combination of these kinds must be recommended by the board of trustees of the
trust and approved by the affirmative vote of at least (a) 80% of the
votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares of beneficial
interest of the trust and (b) two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast
by holders of voting shares of beneficial interest of the trust other than
shares held by the interested shareholder with whom, or with whose affiliate,
the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate
of the interested shareholder.  These supermajority voting requirements do not
apply if the trust’s common shareholders receive a minimum price, as defined in
the MGCL, for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the
same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common
shares.

The provisions of the MGCL do not apply, however,
to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of trustees
of the applicable trust before the interested shareholder becomes an interested
shareholder, and a person is not an interested shareholder if the board of
trustees approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise
would have become an interested shareholder.

In approving a transaction, the Board may provide
that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval,
with any terms and conditions determined by the Board.  Vornado’s Board has
adopted a resolution exempting any business combination between Vornado and any
trustee or officer of Vornado or its affiliates.  As a result, any trustee or
officer of Vornado or its affiliates may be able to enter into business
combinations with Vornado that may not be in the best interest of Vornado’s
shareholders. With respect to business combinations with other persons, the
business combination provisions of the MGCL may have the effect of delaying,
deferring or preventing a change in control of Vornado or other transaction
that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the
shareholders. The business combination statute may discourage others from
trying to acquire control of Vornado and increase the difficulty of
consummating any offer.

We may change our policies
without obtaining the approval of our shareholders.

Our operating and financial policies, including
our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other companies,
growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively
determined by our Board of Trustees. Accordingly, our shareholders do not
control these policies.

Our Ownership
Structure and Related-Party Transactions May Give Rise to Conflicts of
Interest.

Steven Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some
of our other trustees and officers have interests or positions in other
entities that may compete with us.

As of December 31, 2012, Interstate Properties, a
New Jersey general partnership, and its partners owned an aggregate of
approximately 6.5% of the common shares of Vornado and 26.3% of the common
stock of Alexander’s, which is described below.  Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum
and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the three partners of Interstate Properties.
Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board of Vornado, the managing general
partner of Interstate Properties and the Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer of Alexander’s. Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are
trustees of Vornado and also directors of Alexander’s.

Because of these overlapping interests,
Mr. Roth and Interstate Properties and its partners may have substantial
influence over Vornado and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Vornado’s
shareholders for approval. In addition, certain decisions concerning our
operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among
Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate Properties and our other
equity or debt holders. In addition, Mr. Roth, Interstate Properties and
its partners, and Alexander’s currently and may in the future engage in a wide
variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts
of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as which of these
entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business
opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties
and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential
competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, competition
for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as
acquisitions and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these
entities.


We currently manage and
lease the real estate assets of Interstate Properties under a management
agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of base rent and
percentage rent. The management agreement has a one-year term and is
automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’
notice at the end of the term. Because of the relationship among Vornado,
Interstate Properties and Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight, as described
above, the terms of the management agreement and any future agreements between
us and Interstate Properties may not be comparable to those we could have
negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.

There may be conflicts of
interest between Alexander’s and us.

As of December 31, 2012, we owned 32.4% of the
outstanding common stock of Alexander’s. Alexander’s is a REIT that has six
properties, which are located in the greater New York metropolitan area.  In
addition to the 2.1% that they indirectly own through Vornado, Interstate
Properties, which is described above, and its partners owned 26.3% of the
outstanding common stock of Alexander’s as of December 31, 2012. Mr. Roth
is the Chairman of the Board of Vornado, the managing general partner of
Interstate Properties, and the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer of Alexander’s.  Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are trustees of
Vornado and also directors of Alexander’s and general partners of Interstate
Properties.  Michael D. Fascitelli is the President and Chief Executive Officer
of Vornado and the President of Alexander’s and Dr. Richard West is a trustee
of Vornado and a director of Alexander’s.  In addition, Joseph Macnow, our
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, holds the same position
with Alexander’s.  Alexander’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol “ALX.”

We manage, develop and lease Alexander’s
properties under management and development agreements and leasing agreements
under which we receive annual fees from Alexander’s. These agreements have a
one-year term expiring in March of each year and are all automatically
renewable. Because Vornado and Alexander’s share common senior management and
because certain of the trustees of Vornado constitute a majority of the
directors of Alexander’s, the terms of the foregoing agreements and any future
agreements between us and Alexander’s may not be comparable to those we could
have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.

For a description of Interstate Properties’
ownership of Vornado and Alexander’s, see

“Steven Roth and Interstate
Properties may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of our
other trustees and officers have interests or positions in other entities that
may compete with us”

above.


The
Number of Shares of Vornado Realty Trust and the Market for Those Shares Give
Rise to Various Risks.

The trading price of our
common shares has been volatile and may fluctuate.

The trading price of our common shares has been
volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of a number of
factors, many of which are outside our control.  In addition, the stock market
is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect
the market prices of the shares of many companies.  These broad market
fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market
price of our common shares.  Among the factors that could affect the price of
our common shares are:

·

our financial condition and performance;

·

the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of
tenant bankruptcies or defaults;

·

actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating
results and financial condition;

·

our dividend policy;

·

the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and
the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in comparison to other equity
securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and
fixed income securities;

·

uncertainty and volatility in the equity and credit markets;

·

changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of
research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by
rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs;

·

failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;

·

speculation in the press or investment community;

·

strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions
or restructurings;

·

the extent of institutional investor interest in us;

·

the extent of short-selling of our common shares and the shares
of our competitors;

·

fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our
competitors;

·

general financial and economic market conditions and, in
particular, developments related to market conditions for REITs and other real
estate related companies;

·

domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our
performance; and

·

all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report
on the Form 10-K.

A significant
decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for shareholders.

Vornado
has many shares available for future sale, which could hurt the market price of
its shares.

The interests of our current shareholders could be
diluted if we issue additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2012, we
had authorized but unissued, 63,265,289 common shares of beneficial interest,
$.04 par value and 58,766,023 preferred shares of beneficial interest, no par
value; of which 20,705,537 common shares are reserved for issuance upon
redemption of Class A Operating Partnership units, convertible securities and
employee stock options and 11,200,000 preferred shares are reserved for issuance
upon redemption of preferred Operating Partnership units.  Any shares not
reserved may be issued from time to time in public or private offerings or in
connection with acquisitions.  In addition, common and preferred shares
reserved may be sold upon issuance in the public market after registration
under the Securities Act or under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or
other available exemptions from registration.  We cannot predict the effect
that future sales of our common and preferred shares or Operating Partnership
Class A and preferred units will have on the market prices of our outstanding
shares.

Increased interest rates
may hurt the value of our common and preferred shares.

We believe that investors consider the
distribution rate on REIT shares, expressed as a percentage of the price of the
shares, relative to interest rates as an important factor in deciding whether
to buy or sell the shares. If interest rates go up, prospective purchasers of
REIT shares may expect a higher distribution rate. Higher interest rates would
likely increase our borrowing costs and might decrease funds available for
distribution. Thus, higher interest rates could cause the market price of our
common and preferred shares to decline.

New York

As of December 31, 2012, our New York segment consisted of 65 properties aggregating 27.1 million square feet, of which we own 21.9 million square feet.  The 21.9 million square feet is comprised of 16.8 million square feet of office space in 31 properties, 2.1 million square feet of retail space in 49 properties, four residential properties containing 1,655 units, the 1.4 million square foot Hotel Pennsylvania, and our interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”).  The New York segment also includes 11 garages totaling 1.7 million square feet (5,159 spaces) which are managed by, or leased to, third parties.

New York lease terms generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 20 years for major tenants, and may provide for extension options at market rates.  Leases typically provide for periodic step‑ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants their share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year.  Electricity is provided to tenants on a sub-metered basis or included in rent based on surveys and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases.  Leases also typically provide for free rent and tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.

As of December 31, 2012, the occupancy rate for our New York segment was 96.2%.  The statistics provided in the following sections include information on the office and retail space.

Washington,
DC

As of December 31, 2012, our Washington, DC
segment consisted of 73 properties aggregating 19.1 million square feet, of
which we own 16.5 million square feet.  The 16.5 million square feet is
comprised of 13.6 million square feet of office space in 59 properties, seven
residential properties containing 2,414 units, a hotel property, and 20.8 acres
of undeveloped land.  The Washington, DC segment also includes 56 garages
totaling approximately 8.9 million square feet (29,611 spaces) which are
managed by or leased to third parties.

Washington, DC office lease terms generally range
from five to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 15 years for major
tenants, and may provide for extension options at either pre-negotiated or
market rates. Leases typically provide for periodic step-ups in rent over the
term of the lease and pass through to tenants, the tenants’ share of increases
in real estate taxes and certain property operating expenses over a base year.
Periodic step-ups in rent are usually based upon either fixed percentage
increases or the consumer price index. Leases also typically provide for free
rent and tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s
initial construction costs of its premises.

As of December 31, 2012, the occupancy rate for
our Washington DC segment was 84.1% and 33.0% of the occupied space was leased
to various agencies of the U.S. Government.  The statistics provided in the

Base Realignment and Closure (“BRAC”)

Our
Washington, DC segment was and continues to be impacted by the BRAC statute,
which requires the Department of Defense (“DOD”) to relocate from 2,395,000
square feet in our buildings in the Northern Virginia area to government owned
military bases.  The table below summarizes the effects of BRAC on our
Washington, DC segment for square feet leased by the DOD.  See page 80 for the
impact on 2012 EBITDA and the estimated impact on 2013 EBITDA.

In the first quarter of 2012, we notified the lender that
due to scheduled lease expirations resulting primarily from the effects of the
BRAC statute, the Skyline properties

had a 26% vacancy

rate and rising (49.8% as of December 31, 2012) and,
accordingly, cash flows are expected to decrease.  As a result, our subsidiary
that owns these properties does not have and is not expected to have for some
time sufficient funds to pay all of its current obligations, including interest
payments to the lender.  Based on the projected vacancy and the significant
amount of capital required to re-tenant these properties, at our request, the
mortgage loan was transferred to the special servicer.  In the second quarter
of 2012, we entered into a forbearance agreement with the special servicer to
apply cash flows of the property, before interest on the loan, towards the

repayment
of $4,000,000 of tenant

improvements and leasing
commissions we funded in connection with a new lease at these properties, which
was repaid in the third quarter.  The forbearance agreement was amended January
31, 2013, to extend its maturity through April 1, 2013 and provides for
interest shortfalls to be deferred and added to the principal balance of the
loan and not give rise to a loan default. As of December 31, 2012, the deferred
interest

amounted to $26,957,000.  We continue to negotiate with the special
servicer to restructure the terms of the loan.


RETAIL
PROPERTIES

As of December 31, 2012, our Retail Properties
segment consisted of 120 retail properties, of which 114 are strip shopping
centers and single tenant retail assets located primarily in the Northeast,
Mid-Atlantic and California and six are regional malls located in New York, New
Jersey, Virginia and San Juan, Puerto Rico.  Our strip shopping centers and
malls are generally located on major highways in mature, densely populated
areas, and therefore attract consumers from a regional, rather than a
neighborhood market place.

Retail
Properties’ lease terms generally range from five years or less in some
instances for smaller tenants to as long as 25 years for major tenants. 
Leases generally provide for reimbursements of real estate taxes, insurance and
common area maintenance charges (including roof and structure in strip shopping
centers, unless it is the tenant’s direct responsibility), and percentage rents
based on tenant sales volume.  Percentage rents accounted for less than 1% of
the Retail Properties total revenues during 2012.

Strip Shopping Centers

Our strip shopping centers contain an aggregate of
15.6 million square feet, of which we own 15.0 million square feet.  These
properties are substantially (approximately 70%) leased to large stores (over
20,000 square feet). Tenants include destination retailers such as
discount department stores, supermarkets, home improvement stores, discount
apparel stores and membership warehouse clubs. Tenants typically offer basic
consumer necessities such as food, health and beauty aids, moderately priced
clothing, building materials and home improvement supplies, and compete
primarily on the basis of price and location.

Regional Malls

The Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, New Jersey,
in which we own a 50% interest, contains 1.5 million square feet and is
anchored by Macy’s, Lord & Taylor, JC Penney and Boscov’s, three of which
own their stores aggregating 612,000 square feet.

The Springfield Mall in Springfield, Virginia,
contains 1.4 million square feet and is anchored by Macy’s, JC Penney and
Target, two of which own their stores aggregating 390,000 square feet.  We have
commenced the renovation of the mall, which is expected to be substantially
completed in 2014.

The Broadway Mall in Hicksville, Long Island, New
York contains 1.1 million square feet and is anchored by Macy’s, Ikea, National
Amusement and Target, two of which owns its store aggregating 376,000 square
feet.

The Bergen Town Center in Paramus, New Jersey
contains 948,000 square feet and is anchored by Century 21, Whole Foods Market
and Target.

The Montehiedra Mall in San Juan,
Puerto Rico contains 540,000 square feet and is anchored by The
Home Depot, Kmart and Marshalls.

The Las Catalinas Mall in San Juan, Puerto
Rico, contains 494,000 square feet and is anchored by Kmart and Sears,
which owns its 139,000 square foot store.

MERCHANDISE MART

As of December 31, 2012, our Merchandise Mart segment consisted of the 3.5 million square foot Merchandise Mart in Chicago, 7 West 34th Street in New York City and 4 garages in Chicago totaling 558,000 square feet (1,681 spaces).

In 2012, we sold four properties and the Canadian Trade Shows for an aggregate of $456,400,000, which resulted in a net gain aggregating $79,820,000.

In July 2012, we leased 572,000 square feet at the Merchandise Mart to Motorola Mobility, owned by Google, as their Corporate headquarters for a 15-year term.  In the first quarter of 2013, Motorola Mobility took possession of three floors aggregating 495,000 square feet and will take possession of the remaining space in the second quarter.  As a result of this lease, the office component of the building was increased to approximately 50%.

In 2014, 7 West 34th Street (currently a showroom building), will be converted to an office building and will be transferred to our New York segment.

As a result of certain recent organizational changes and asset sales in 2012, the Merchandise Mart segment no longer meets the criteria for it to be a separate reportable segment; accordingly, effective January 1, 2013, it will be reclassified to our Other segment.

In 2010, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into agreements with Cuyahoga County, Ohio (the “County”) to develop and operate the Cleveland Medical Mart and Convention Center (the “Facility”), a 1,000,000 square foot showroom, trade show and conference center in Cleveland’s central business district.  The County is funding the development of the Facility, using the proceeds it received from the issuance of general obligation bonds and other sources, up to the development budget of $418,000,000 and maintains effective control of the property.  During the 17-year development and operating period, our subsidiaries will receive net settled payments of approximately $10,000,000 per year, which are net of a $36,000,000 annual obligation to the County.  Our subsidiaries’ obligation has been pledged by the County to the bondholders, but is payable by our subsidiaries only to the extent that they first receive at least an equal payment from the County.  Construction of the Facility is expected to be completed in 2013.  As of December 31, 2012, $379,658,000 of the $418,000,000 development budget was expended.

As of December 31, 2012, the occupancy rate for the Merchandise Mart segment was 92.6%.  The statistics provided in the following sections include information on the office and showroom spaces.

Merchandise Mart lease terms generally range from three to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 15 years for major tenants. Leases typically provide for periodic step-ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants their share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year. Electricity is provided to tenants on a sub-metered basis or included in rent and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases. Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction of its premises.

The showrooms provide manufacturers and wholesalers with permanent and temporary space in which to display products for buyers, specifiers and end users. The showrooms are also used for participating in trade shows for the contract furniture, casual furniture, gift, carpet, crafts, apparel and design industries.

Toys, a worldwide specialty retailer of toys and baby products, which has a
significant real estate component. Toys had $5.7 billion of outstanding debt at
October 27, 2012, of which our pro rata share was $1.9 billion, none of which

OTHER INVESTMENTS

555 California Street

As of December
31, 2012, we own a 70% controlling interest in a three-building office complex
containing 1.8 million square feet, known as the Bank of America Center,
located at California and Montgomery Streets in San Francisco’s financial
district (“555 California Street”).  555 California Street is encumbered by a
$600,000,000 mortgage loan that bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.10% and
matures in September 2021.

555 California
Street lease terms generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenants
to as long as 15 years for major tenants, and may provide for extension options
at market rates. Leases typically provide for periodic step‑ups in rent
over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants their share of increases
in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year.  Leases also
typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the
tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.

ITEM
3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are from time to
time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In
our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such
matters, including the matter referred to below, is not expected to have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

In 2003, Stop &
Shop filed an action against us in the New York Supreme Court, claiming that we
had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect $5,000,000
($6,000,000 beginning February 1, 2012) of annual rent from Stop &
Shop pursuant to a Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of
the leases to which the annual rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop
asserted that an order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New
York, as modified on appeal by the District Court, froze our right to
reallocate and effectively terminated our right to collect the annual rent from
Stop & Shop.  We asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all of the
unpaid annual rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration
that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the annual rent as long as
any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in
effect.  A trial was held in November 2010.  On November 7, 2011, the Court
determined that we had a continuing right to allocate the annual rent to
unexpired leases covered by the Master Agreement and Guaranty, and directed
entry of a judgment in our favor ordering Stop & Shop to pay us the unpaid
annual rent accrued through February 28, 2011 in the amount of $37,422,000, a
portion of the annual rent due from March 1, 2011 through the date of judgment,
interest, and attorneys’ fees.  On December 16, 2011, a money judgment based on
the Court’s decision was entered in our favor in the amount of $56,597,000
(including interest and costs).  Stop & Shop appealed the Court’s decision
and the judgment and posted a bond to secure payment of the judgment. On
January 12, 2012, we commenced a new action against Stop & Shop seeking
recovery of $2,500,000 of annual rent not included in the money judgment, plus
additional annual rent as it accrues.  At December 31, 2012, we had a
$47,900,000 receivable from Stop & Shop, which is included as a component
of “tenant and other receivables” on our consolidated balance sheet.  On
February 6, 2013, we received $124,000,000 pursuant to a settlement agreement
with Stop & Shop.  The settlement terminates our right to receive
$6,000,000 of additional annual rent under the 1992 agreement, for a period
potentially through 2031.  As a result of this settlement, we collected the
aforementioned $47,900,000 receivable and will recognize approximately
$59,000,000 of net income in the first quarter of 2013.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities

During the fourth quarter of 2012, we issued 46,047
common shares upon the redemption of Class A units of the Operating
Partnership held by persons who received units, in private placements in
earlier periods, in exchange for their interests in limited partnerships that
owned real estate. The common shares were issued without registration under the
Securities Act of 1933 in reliance on Section 4 (2) of that Act.

Information relating to compensation plans under
which our equity securities are authorized for issuance is set forth under Part
III, Item 12 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and such information is

________________________________

(1)   FFO
is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors
of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). 
NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gain from
sales of depreciated real estate assets, real estate impairment losses,
depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, extraordinary
items and other specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such
adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are
used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons
of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it
excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains
on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the
value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating
based on existing market conditions.  FFO does not represent cash generated
from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available
to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net
income as a performance measure or cash flows as a liquidity measure.  FFO may
not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Overview

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated
real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and
substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). 
Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its
shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and
the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their
obligations to creditors.  Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately
94.0% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership
at December 31, 2012.  All references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and
“Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries,
including the Operating Partnership.

We own and operate office and retail properties
(our “core” operations) with large concentrations in the New York City
metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area. In
addition, we have a 32.6% interest in Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”) which has a
significant real estate component, a 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE:
ALX) (“Alexander’s”), which has six properties in the greater New York
metropolitan area, as well as interests in other real estate and related
investments.

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder
value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. Below
is a table comparing our performance to the Morgan Stanley REIT Index (“RMS”)
and the SNL REIT Index (“SNL”) for the following periods ended December 31, 2012:

continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating
strategies through:

·

Maintaining a
superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial
spirit;

·

Investing in
properties in select markets, such as New York City and
Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital
appreciation;

·

Acquiring
quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a
significant potential for higher rents;

·

Investing in
retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;

·

Developing and
redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and

·

Investing in
operating companies that have a significant real estate component.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and
investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset
sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets.  We may also
offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in
exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these
securities in the future.

We compete with a large number of property owners
and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their
investments than we are. Principal factors of competition include rents
charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property
and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon,
among other factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies, the
financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants
and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation
costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.  See
“Risk Factors” in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.

VorNADO CAPITAL
PARTNERS REAL ESTATE FUND (The “FUND”)

In February 2011, the Fund’s subscription
period closed with an aggregate of $800,000,000 of capital commitments, of
which we committed $200,000,000.  We are the general partner and investment
manager of the Fund, which has an eight-year term and a three-year investment
period.  During the investment period, which concludes in July 2013, the Fund
is our exclusive investment vehicle for all investments that fit within its
investment parameters, including debt, equity and other interests in real
estate, and excluding (i) investments in vacant land and ground-up development;
(ii) investments acquired by merger or primarily for our securities or
properties; (iii) properties which can be combined with or relate to our
existing properties; (iv) securities of commercial mortgage loan servicers and
investments derived from any such investments; (v) non-controlling interests in
equity and debt securities; and (vi) investments located outside of North
America.   The Fund’s investments are reported on its balance sheet at fair
value, with changes in value each period recognized in earnings.  We
consolidate the accounts of the Fund into our consolidated financial
statements, retaining the fair value basis of accounting.

During 2012, the
Fund made four investments (described below) aggregating $203,700,000.  As of
December 31, 2012, the Fund has nine investments with an aggregate fair value
of $600,786,000, or $67,642,000 in excess of cost, and has remaining unfunded
commitments of $217,676,000, of which our share was $54,419,000.

800 Corporate Pointe

On November 30,
2012, the Fund acquired 800 Corporate Pointe, a 243,000 square foot office
building and the accompanying six-level parking structure (1,964 spaces)
located in Culver City, Los Angeles, California, for $95,700,000 in cash.

501 Broadway

On August 20,
2012, the Fund acquired 501 Broadway, a 9,000 square foot retail property in
New York for $31,000,000.  The purchase price consisted of $11,000,000 in
cash and a $20,000,000 mortgage loan.  The three-year loan bears interest
at LIBOR plus 2.75%, with a floor of 3.50%, and has two one-year extension
options.

1100 Lincoln Road

On July 2, 2012,
the Fund acquired 1100 Lincoln Road, a 167,000 square foot retail property, the
western anchor of the Lincoln Road Shopping District in Miami Beach, Florida,
for $132,000,000.  The purchase price consisted of $66,000,000 in cash and

Acquisitions and Investments

Independence
Plaza

In 2011, we acquired a 51% interest in
the subordinated debt of Independence Plaza, a three-building 1,328 unit
residential complex in the Tribeca submarket of Manhattan which has 54,500
square feet of retail space and 550 parking spaces, for $45,000,000 and a
warrant to purchase 25% of the equity for $1,000,000.  On December 21, 2012, we
acquired a 58.75% interest in the property as follows: (i) buying one of the
equity partners’ 33.75% interest for $160,000,000, (ii) exercising our warrant
for 25% of the equity and (iii) contributing the appreciated value of our
interest in the subordinated debt as preferred equity.  In connection
therewith, we recognized income of $105,366,000, comprised of $60,396,000 from
the accelerated amortization of the discount on the subordinated debt
immediately preceding the conversion to preferred equity, and a $44,970,000
purchase price fair value adjustment upon exercising the warrant.  The current
transaction values the property at $844,800,000.  The property is currently encumbered
by a $334,225,000 mortgage.  We expect to refinance the $334,225,000
mortgage in 2013, substantially decreasing our cash investment.  We manage
the retail space at the property and Stellar Management, our partner, manages
the residential space.

666 Fifth Avenue - Retail

On December 6, 2012, we
acquired a retail condominium located at 666 Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street for

contains 114,000 square feet, 39,000 square feet in fee and 75,000 square feet
by long-term lease from the 666 Fifth Avenue office condominium, which is 49.5%
owned by us.

Marriott Marquis Times Square -
Retail and Signage

On July 30, 2012, we entered
into a lease with Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE: HST) (“Host”), under
which we will redevelop the retail and signage components of the Marriott
Marquis Times Square Hotel.  The Marriott Marquis with over 1,900 rooms is
one of the largest hotels in Manhattan.  It is located in the heart of the
bow-tie of Times Square and spans the entire block front from 45th Street to
46th Street on Broadway.  The Marriott Marquis is directly across from our
1540 Broadway iconic retail property leased to Forever 21 and Disney
flagship stores.  We plan to spend over $140,000,000 to redevelop and
substantially expand the existing retail space, including converting the below
grade parking garage into retail, and creating six-story, 300 foot wide block
front, dynamic LED signs.  During the term of the lease we will pay fixed
rent equal to the sum of $12,500,000, plus a portion of the property’s net cash
flow after we receive a 5.2% preferred return on our invested capital. 
The lease contains put/call options which, if exercised, would lead to our ownership. 
Host can exercise the put option during defined periods following the
conversion of the project to a condominium.  We can exercise our call
option under the same terms, at any time after the fifteenth year of the lease
term.

The leasing activity presented below is based on
leases signed during the period and is not intended to coincide with the
commencement of rental revenue in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).  Tenant
improvements and leasing commissions presented below are based on square feet
leased during the period.  Second generation relet space represents square
footage that has not been vacant for more than nine months.  The leasing
activity for the New York segment excludes Alexander’s, the Hotel Pennsylvania
and residential.

Washington, DC Segment

As a result of the Base Realignment and Closure
(“BRAC”) statute, we estimated that occupancy would decrease from 90% at
December 31, 2011, to between 82% and 84% at December 31, 2012 and that 2012
EBITDA before discontinued operations and gains on sale of real estate would be
lower than 2011 by approximately $55,000,000 to $65,000,000 (revised to
$50,000,000 to $60,000,000 in the third quarter of 2012).  At December 31,
2012, occupancy was 84.1% and 2012 EBITDA before discontinued operations and
gains on sale of real estate was lower than 2011 by $54,900,000.

We estimate that 2013 EBITDA will be between
$5,000,000 and $15,000,000 lower than 2012 EBITDA.

Of the 2,395,000 square feet subject to BRAC,
348,000 square feet has been taken out of service for redevelopment and 545,000
square feet has been leased or is pending.  The table below summarizes the
status of the BRAC space as of December 31, 2012.

In the first quarter of 2012, we notified the lender that
due to scheduled lease expirations resulting primarily from the effects of the
BRAC statute, the Skyline properties

had a 26% vacancy

rate and rising (49.8% as of December 31, 2012) and,
accordingly, cash flows are expected to decrease.  As a result, our subsidiary
that owns these properties does not have and is not expected to have for some
time sufficient funds to pay all of its current obligations, including interest
payments to the lender.  Based on the projected vacancy and the significant
amount of capital required to re-tenant these properties, at our request, the
mortgage loan was transferred to the special servicer.  In the second quarter
of 2012, we entered into a forbearance agreement with the special servicer to
apply cash flows of the property, before interest on the loan, towards the

repayment
of $4,000,000 of tenant

improvements and leasing
commissions we funded in connection with a new lease at these properties, which
was repaid in the third quarter.  The forbearance agreement was amended January
31, 2013, to extend its maturity through April 1, 2013 and provides for
interest shortfalls to be deferred and added to the principal balance of the
loan and not give rise to a loan default. As of December 31, 2012, the deferred
interest

amounted to $26,957,000.  We continue to negotiate with the
special servicer to restructure the terms of the loan.


Recently Issued
Accounting Literature

In
May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Update No.
2011-04,

Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common
Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS

(“ASU No. 2011-04”).  ASU No. 2011-04 provides a uniform framework for
fair value measurements and related disclosures between GAAP and International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and requires additional disclosures,
including: (i) quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, a
description of the valuation processes used, and a qualitative discussion about
the sensitivity of the measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs, for
Level 3 fair value measurements; (ii) fair value of financial instruments not
measured at fair value but for which disclosure of fair value is required,
based on their levels in the fair value hierarchy; and (iii) transfers
between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  The adoption of this
update on January 1, 2012 did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements, but resulted in additional fair value measurement
disclosures (See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K).

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial
statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary
of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of
our consolidated financial statements.  The summary should be read in
conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies
included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Real Estate

Real estate is carried at cost, net of
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Maintenance and repairs are expensed
as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life
of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs
associated with a property to its various components. If we do not allocate
these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real
estate, depreciation expense may be misstated.  As real estate is undergoing
development activities, all property operating expenses directly associated
with and attributable to, the development and construction of a project,
including interest expense, are capitalized to the cost of real property to the
extent we believe such costs are recoverable through the value of the
property.  The capitalization period begins when development activities are
underway and ends when the project is substantially complete.  General and
administrative costs are expensed as incurred.

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess
the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements,
identified intangibles such as acquired above and below-market leases and
acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and
we allocate purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value
based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and
capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future
cash flows are based on a number of factors, including historical operating
results, known trends and market/economic conditions. Identified intangibles
are recorded at their estimated fair value, separate and apart from goodwill.
Identified intangibles that are determined to have finite lives are amortized
over the period in which they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly
to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired.

As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the carrying
amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $15.4 billion and
$13.8 billion, respectively.  As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the carrying
amounts of identified intangible assets (including acquired above-market
leases, tenant relationships and acquired in-place leases) were $370,602,000
and $287,844,000, respectively, and the carrying amounts of identified intangible
liabilities, a component of “deferred revenue” on our consolidated balance
sheets, were $463,432,000 and $466,743,000, respectively.

Our properties, including any related intangible
assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An
impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate
projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an
undiscounted basis.  An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the
property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses
are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market
information at the time the analyses are prepared.  If our estimates of the
projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions
change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such
differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.  The
evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on
assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements
that could differ materially from actual results.  Plans to hold properties
over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.


Critical
Accounting Policies – continued

Partially Owned Entities

We consolidate entities in which we have a
controlling financial interest.  In determining whether we have a controlling financial
interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the
accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board
representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and
contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as
well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and we are the
primary beneficiary.  We are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE when
we have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly
impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or
receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. When the
requirements for consolidation are not met, we account for investments under
the equity method of accounting if we have the ability to exercise significant
influence over the entity.  Equity method investments are initially recorded at
cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash
contributions and distributions each period. Investments that do not qualify
for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost
method.

Investments in partially owned entities are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is
measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its
estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended
holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are
prepared.  The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned
entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each
investment and market conditions.  If our estimates of the projected future
cash flows, the nature of development activities for properties for which such
activities are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change
based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses
may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated
financial statements.  The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective
and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates
and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.

As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the carrying
amounts of investments in partially owned entities, including Toys “R” Us, was
$1.704 billion and $1.740 billion, respectively.

Mortgage and Mezzanine Loans Receivable

We invest in mortgage and mezzanine loans of
entities that have significant real estate assets.  These investments are either
secured by the real property or by pledges of the equity interests of the
entities owning the underlying real estate.  We record these investments at the
stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium.  We accrete
or amortize any discount or premium over the life of the related receivable
utilizing the effective interest method or straight-line method, if the result
is not materially different. We evaluate the collectability of both interest
and principal of each of our loans whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate such amounts may not be recoverable. A loan is impaired when it is
probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the
existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss
accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the
present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective
interest rate, or as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if
the loan is collateral dependent. If our estimates of the collectability of
both interest and principal or the fair value of our loans change based on
market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be
different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial
statements. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the carrying amounts of mortgage
and mezzanine loans receivable were $225,359,000 and $133,948,000, respectively.


Critical
Accounting Policies – continued

Allowance For Doubtful Accounts

We periodically evaluate the collectability of
amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts ($37,674,000
and $43,241,000 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011) for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the
lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from
the straight-lining of rents ($3,165,000 and $3,290,000 as of December 31, 2012
and 2011, respectively). This receivable arises from earnings recognized in
excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management
exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment
history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These
estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our
consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

We have the following revenue sources and revenue
recognition policies:

·

Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized
over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis
which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases. 
We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the
leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. 
In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance
for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a
reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease.

·

Percentage
Rent — income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon tenant sales
exceeding defined thresholds. These rents are recognized only after the
contingency has been removed (i.e., when tenant sales thresholds have been
achieved).

·

Hotel
Revenue — income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which
consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue.
Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue
are recognized when the services have been rendered.

·

Trade
Shows Revenue — income arising from the operation of trade shows, including
rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have
occurred.

·

Expense
Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the
recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of
the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the
expenses are incurred.

·

Management,
Leasing and Other Fees — income arising from contractual agreements with third
parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the
related services are performed under the respective agreements.

·

Cleveland Medical Mart — revenue arising from the development of
the Cleveland Medical Mart.  This revenue is recognized as the related services
are performed under the respective agreements using the criteria set forth in
ASC 605-25,

Multiple Element Arrangements

, as we are providing
development, marketing, leasing, and other property management services.

Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among
other things, its collectibility. If our assessment of the collectibility of
revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be
material.

Income Taxes

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to
continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) under Sections
856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections,
a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend
to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not
be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its
shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income.
Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If we fail to
distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, or fail to meet
other REIT requirements, we may fail to qualify as a REIT which may result in
substantial adverse tax consequences.


Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Years Ended December
31, 2012, 2011 and 2010

Effective
January 1, 2012, as a result of certain organizational and operational changes,
we redefined the New York business segment to encompass all of our Manhattan
assets by including the 1.0 million square feet in 21 freestanding Manhattan
street retail assets (formerly in our Retail segment), and the Hotel
Pennsylvania and our interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (formerly in our Other
segment).  Accordingly, we have reclassified the prior period segment financial
results to conform to the current year presentation.  See note (3) on page 87
for the elements of the New York segment’s EBITDA.  Below is a summary of net income and a reconciliation
of net income to EBITDA

Notes to preceding tabular
  information:

(1)

EBITDA represents
  "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization."
  We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing
  the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return
  on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are
  bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to
  make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets
  to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net
  income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by
  other companies.

(2)

Interest and debt expense,
  depreciation and amortization and income tax expense (benefit) in the
  reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these
  items from partially owned entities.

Income
Applicable to Toys

In the year ended December 31, 2012, we
recognized net income of $14,859,000 from our investment in Toys, comprised of $45,267,000
for our 32.6% share of Toys’ net income and $9,592,000 of management fees,
partially offset by a $40,000,000 non-cash impairment loss (see below).

In the year ended December 31, 2011, we
recognized net income of $48,540,000 from our investment in Toys, comprised of
$39,592,000 for our 32.7% share of Toys’ net income and $8,948,000 of
management fees.

We account for Toys on the equity method, which
means our investment is increased for our pro rata share of Toys undistributed
net income.  Since our acquisition in July 2005, the carrying amount of our
investment has grown from $396,000,000 to $518,041,000 after we recognized our
share of Toys third quarter net loss in our fourth quarter.  We estimate that
the fair value of our investment is approximately $478,000,000 at December 31,
2012.  We have concluded that the $40,000,000 decline in the value of our
investment is “other-than-temporary” based on, among other factors, compression
of earnings multiples of comparable retailers and our inability to forecast a
recovery in the near term.  Accordingly, we recognized a non-cash impairment
loss of $40,000,000 in the fourth quarter.

We will continue to assess the recoverability of
our investment each quarter.  To the extent that the current facts don’t
change, we would recognize a non-cash impairment loss equal to our share of
Toys fourth quarter net income in our 2013 first quarter.  In the first quarter
of 2012, our share of Toys fourth quarter net income was approximately
$114,000,000.

year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $21,786,000 in the prior year, an
increase of $10,232,000.  This increase resulted primarily from a $25,734,000

of $5,732,000.  This decrease resulted primarily from lower net income subject
to allocation to unitholders.

Preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership
were $9,936,000 in the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $14,853,000 in
the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $4,917,000.  This decrease
resulted primarily from the redemption of the 7.0% Series D-10 and 6.75% Series
D-14 cumulative redeemable preferred units in July 2012.

Preferred
Share Dividends

Preferred share dividends were $76,937,000 in the
year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $65,531,000 in the prior year, an
increase of $11,406,000.  This increase resulted from the issuance of
$246,000,000 of 6.875% Series J cumulative redeemable preferred shares in April
2011 and $300,000,000 of 5.70% Series K cumulative redeemable preferred shares
in July 2012, partially offset by the redemption of $75,000,000 of 7.0% Series
E cumulative redeemable preferred shares in August 2012.

Discount on
Preferred Share and Unit Redemptions

Discount on
preferred share and unit redemptions were $8,948,000 in the year ended December
31, 2012 and resulted primarily from the redemption of all of the 7.0% Series
D-10 and 6.75% Series D-14 cumulative redeemable preferred units, compared to a
$5,000,000 discount in the prior year, which resulted from the redemption of the
Series D-11 cumulative redeemable preferred units.

Same Store EBITDA

Same store EBITDA represents EBITDA from property
level operations which are owned by us in both the current and prior year
reporting periods.  Same store EBITDA excludes segment-level overhead expenses,
which are expenses that we do not consider to be property-level expenses, as
well as other non-operating items.  We present same store EBITDA on both a GAAP
basis and a cash basis, which excludes income from the straight-lining of
rents, amortization of below-market leases, net of above-market leases and
other non-cash adjustments. We present these non-GAAP measures because we use
them to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of
our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or
refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and
segments to those of our peers.  Same store EBITDA should not be considered as
an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Below are the same store EBITDA results on a GAAP
and cash basis for each of our segments for the year ended December 31, 2012,
compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.

Supplemental Information

Net
Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2012 and

Effective January 1, 2012, as a result of certain
organizational and operational changes, we redefined the New York business
segment to encompass all of our Manhattan assets by including the 1.0 million
square feet in 21 freestanding Manhattan street retail assets (formerly in our
Retail segment), and the Hotel Pennsylvania and our interest in Alexander’s,
Inc. (formerly in our Other segment).  Accordingly, we have reclassified the
prior period segment financial results to conform to the current year
presentation.  See note (3) on page 105 for the elements of the New York
segment’s EBITDA.  Below is a summary of net income and a reconciliation of net
income to EBITDA

Net Income and EBITDA by
Segment for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 - continued

Notes to preceding tabular
  information:

(1)

EBITDA represents
  "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization."
  We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing
  the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return
  on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are
  bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to
  make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets
  to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net
  income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by
  other companies.

(2)

Interest and debt expense,
  depreciation and amortization and income tax (benefit) expense in the
  reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these
  items from partially owned entities.

Same Store EBITDA

Same store EBITDA represents EBITDA from property
level operations which are owned by us in both the current and prior year
reporting periods.  Same store EBITDA excludes segment-level overhead expenses,
which are expenses that we do not consider to be property-level expenses, as
well as other non-operating items.  We present same store EBITDA on both a GAAP
basis and a cash basis, which excludes income from the straight-lining of
rents, amortization of below-market leases, net of above-market leases and
other non-cash adjustments. We present these non-GAAP measures because we use
them to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of
our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or
refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and
segments to those of our peers.  Same store EBITDA should not be considered as
an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Below are the same store EBITDA results on a GAAP
and cash basis for each of our segments for the three months ended December 31,
2012, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2011.

Related Party Transactions

Alexander’s

We own 32.4% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, the
Chairman of our Board, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President and Chief
Executive Officer, are officers and directors of Alexander’s.  We provide
various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and
leasing agreements.  These agreements are described in Note 6 - Investments in
Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Interstate Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr.
Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B.
Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s, are
Interstate’s two other partners. As of December 31, 2012, Interstate
and its partners beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 6.5% of the
common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 26.3% of Alexander’s common
stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of
Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual
fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management
agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless
terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term.
We believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies,
that the management agreement terms are fair to us.

Other

On March 8, 2012, Mr. Roth repaid his $13,122,500
outstanding loan from the Company.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Property rental income is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, debt service, leasing commissions, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, as well as acquisition and development costs.    Other sources of liquidity to fund cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, and our revolving credit facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity; and asset sales.

We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures.  Capital requirements for development expenditures and acquisitions (excluding Fund acquisitions) may require funding from borrowings and/or equity offerings.  Our Real Estate Fund has aggregate unfunded equity commitments of $217,676,000 for acquisitions, including $54,419,000 from us.

We may from time to time purchase or retire outstanding debt securities.  Such purchases, if any will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors.  The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Dividends

On January 17, 2013, we increased our quarterly common dividend to $0.73 per share (a new indicated annual rate of $2.92 per share).  This dividend, if continued for all of 2013, would require us to pay out approximately $545,000,000 of cash for common share dividends.  In addition, during 2013, we expect to pay approximately $81,500,000 of cash dividends on outstanding preferred shares and approximately $36,000,000 of cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations

We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a “well-known seasoned issuer.”  Our revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB.  Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.  As of December 31, 2012, we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants required by our revolving credit facilities.

As of December 31, 2012, we had $960,319,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $1,307,193,000 of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, net of outstanding borrowings of $1,170,000,000 and letters of credit of $22,807,000.  A summary of our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 is presented below.

We may also refinance or prepay other outstanding debt depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors.  The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Interest on variable rate debt is computed using rates in effect
  at December 31, 2012.

Details of 2012 financing activities are provided
in the “Overview” of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Conditions and Results of Operations.  Details of 2011 financing activities are
discussed below.

Senior Unsecured Debt

On November 30, 2011, we completed a
public offering of $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.0%, ten-year
senior unsecured notes and retained net proceeds of approximately $395,584,000.
The notes were sold at 99.546% of their face amount to yield 5.057%.

In 2011, we renewed both of our unsecured
revolving credit facilities aggregating $2,500,000,000. The first facility,
which was renewed in June 2011, bears interest on drawn amounts at LIBOR plus
1.35% and has a 0.30% facility fee (drawn or undrawn). The second facility,
which was renewed in November 2011, bears interest on drawn amounts at LIBOR
plus 1.25% and has a 0.25% facility fee (drawn or undrawn). The LIBOR spread
and facility fee on both facilities are based on our credit ratings. Both facilities
mature in four years and have one-year extension options.

Secured Debt

On December 28, 2011, we completed a
$330,000,000 refinancing of Eleven Penn Plaza, a 1.1 million square foot
Manhattan office building. The seven-year loan bears interest at LIBOR plus
2.35% and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the fourth year.
We retained net proceeds of approximately $126,000,000, after repaying the
existing loan and closing costs.

On September 1, 2011, we completed a
$600,000,000 refinancing of 555 California Street, a three-building office
complex aggregating 1.8 million square feet in San Francisco’s financial
district, known as the Bank of America Center, in which we own a 70%
controlling interest. The 10-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 5.10% and
amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the fourth year. The
proceeds of the new loan and $45,000,000 of existing cash were used to repay
the existing loan and closing costs.

On May 11, 2011, we repaid the outstanding
balance of the construction loan on West End 25, and closed on a $101,671,000
mortgage at a fixed rate of 4.88%. The loan has a 10-year term and amortizes
based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the sixth year.

On February 11, 2011, we completed a
$425,000,000 refinancing of Two Penn Plaza, a 1.6 million square foot Manhattan
office building. The seven-year loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%, which
was swapped for the term of the loan to a fixed rate of 5.13%. The loan
amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the fourth year. We retained
net proceeds of approximately $139,000,000, after repaying the existing loan
and closing costs.

On February 10, 2011, we completed a
$150,000,000 financing of 2121 Crystal Drive, a 506,000 square foot office
building located in Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia. The 12-year fixed rate
loan bears interest at 5.51% and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule
beginning in the third year. This property was previously unencumbered.

On January 18, 2011, we repaid the
outstanding balance of the construction loan on 220 20th Street and closed on a
$76,100,000 mortgage at a fixed rate of 4.61%. The loan has a seven-year term
and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule.

On January 10, 2011, we completed a
$75,000,000 financing of North Bergen (Tonnelle Avenue), a 410,000 square foot
strip shopping center. The seven-year fixed rate loan bears interest rate at
4.59% and amortizes based on a 25-year schedule beginning in the sixth year.
This property was previously unencumbered.

On January 6, 2011, we completed a
$60,000,000 financing of land under a portion of the Borgata Hotel and Casino
complex. The 10-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 5.14% and amortizes
based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the third year.

Preferred Securities

On April 20, 2011, we sold 7,000,000
6.875% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at a price of $25.00 per
share, in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration
statement. On April 21, 2011, the underwriters exercised their option to
purchase an additional 1,050,000 shares to cover over-allotments. On May 5,
2011 and August 5, 2011 we sold an additional 800,000 and 1,000,000 shares,
respectively, at a price of $25.00 per share. We retained aggregate net
proceeds of $238,842,000, after underwriters’ discounts and issuance costs and
contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for
9,850,000 Series J Preferred Units (with economic terms that mirror those of
the Series J Preferred Shares).

Acquisitions and Investments

Details of 2012
acquisitions and investments are provided in the “Overview” of Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.  Details
of 2011 acquisitions and investments are discussed below.

1399 New York Avenue (the
“Executive Tower”)

On December 23,
2011, we acquired the 97.5% interest that we did not already own in the
Executive Tower, an 11-story, 128,000 square foot Class A office building
located in the Washington, CBD East End submarket close to the White House, for
$104,000,000 in cash.

666 Fifth Avenue Office

On December 16,
2011, we formed a joint venture with an affiliate of the Kushner Companies to
recapitalize the office portion of 666 Fifth Avenue, a 39-story, 1.4 million
square foot Class A office building in Manhattan, located on the full block
front of Fifth Avenue between 52nd and 53rd Street. We acquired a 49.5%
interest in the property from the Kushner Companies, the current owner. In
connection therewith, the existing $1,215,000,000 mortgage loan was modified by
LNR, the special servicer, into a $1,100,000,000 A-Note and a $115,000,000
B-Note and extended to February 2019; and a portion of the current pay interest
was deferred to the B-Note. We and the Kushner Companies have committed to lend
the joint venture an aggregate of $110,000,000 (of which our share is
$80,000,000) for tenant improvements and working capital for the property,
which is senior to the $115,000,000 B-Note. In addition, we have provided the
A-Note holders a limited recourse and cooperation guarantee of up to
$75,000,000 if an event of default occurs and is ongoing.

Independence Plaza

On June 17,
2011, a joint venture in which we are a 51% partner invested $55,000,000 in
cash (of which we contributed $35,000,000) to acquire a face amount of
$150,000,000 of mezzanine loans and a $35,000,000 participation in a senior
loan on Independence Plaza, a three-building 1,328 unit residential complex in
the Tribeca submarket of Manhattan.

280 Park Avenue Joint Venture

On March 16,
2011, we formed a 50/50 joint venture with SL Green Realty Corp to own the
mezzanine debt of 280 Park Avenue, a 1.2 million square foot office building
located between 48th and 49th Streets in Manhattan (the “Property”). We
contributed our mezzanine loan with a face amount of $73,750,000 and they
contributed their mezzanine loans with a face amount of $326,250,000 to the
joint venture. We equalized our interest in the joint venture by paying our
partner $111,250,000 in cash and assuming $15,000,000 of their debt. On May 17,
2011, as part of the recapitalization of the Property, the joint venture
contributed its debt position for 99% of the common equity of a new joint
venture which owns the Property. The new joint venture’s investment is
subordinate to $710,000,000 of third party debt.

The table above excludes anticipated capital

Development
and Redevelopment Expenditures

In 2012, we commenced the re-tenanting and
repositioning of 280 Park Avenue (50% owned), and the renovation of
the 1.4 million square foot Springfield Mall, both of which are expected
to be substantially completed in 2014.  We budgeted approximately $285,000,000
for these projects, of which $31,000,000 was expended in 2012 and $132,000,000
is expected to be expended in 2013 and the balance is expected to be expended
in 2014.

During 2012, we completed the demolition of the
existing residential building down to the second-level, at 220 Central
Park South.

In addition, we continued lobby renovations at several
of our office buildings in New York and Washington, as well as the re-tenanting
and repositioning of a number of our strip shopping centers.

We are also evaluating other development and
redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in Manhattan,
including the Hotel Pennsylvania and in Washington, including 1900 Crystal
Drive, Rosslyn and Pentagon City.

There can be no
assurance that any of our development or redevelopment projects will commence,
or if commenced, be completed on schedule or within budget.


Liquidity and Capital Resources – continued

Insurance

We maintain general liability insurance with
limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all risk property and rental value
insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, including coverage for
terrorist acts, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods.  Our
California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $180,000,000
per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the
affected property, up to a $180,000,000 annual aggregate.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our
wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to all
risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake
insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism,
including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as
defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. Coverage
for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party
insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. 
Coverage for NBCR losses is up to $2.0 billion per occurrence, for which PPIC
is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and 15% of the balance of a
covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of
a covered loss.  We are ultimately responsible for any loss borne by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the
insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism. 
However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially
reasonable terms in future policy years.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage
loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured
notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us
to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance
coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an
equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if
lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could
adversely affect our ability to finance our properties and expand our
portfolio.

Other Commitments and
Contingencies

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us. 
However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant
space.  These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the
satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans. 
As of December 31, 2012, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and
master leases is approximately $310,249,000.

At December 31, 2012, $22,807,000 of letters of
credit were outstanding under one of our revolving credit facilities.  Our
credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain
minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and
provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings
below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions
precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also
contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated
repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

Each of our properties has been subjected to
varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental
assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However,
there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of
contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the
discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not
result in significant costs to us.

Two of our wholly owned subsidiaries that are
contracted to develop and operate the Cleveland Medical Mart and Convention
Center, in Cleveland, Ohio, are required to fund $11,500,000, primarily for
tenant improvements, and they are responsible for operating expenses and are
entitled to the net operating income, if any, upon the completion of
development and the commencement of operations.  As of December 31, 2012, our
subsidiaries have funded $1,100,000 of the commitment.

As of December 31, 2012, we expect to fund
additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating
approximately $163,130,000.

Litigation

We are from time to
time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In
our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such
matters, including the matter referred to below, is not expected to have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

In 2003, Stop &
Shop filed an action against us in the New York Supreme Court, claiming that we
had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect $5,000,000
($6,000,000 beginning February 1, 2012) of annual rent from Stop &
Shop pursuant to a Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of
the leases to which the annual rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop
asserted that an order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New
York, as modified on appeal by the District Court, froze our right to
reallocate and effectively terminated our right to collect the annual rent from
Stop & Shop.  We asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all of the
unpaid annual rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration
that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the annual rent as long as
any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in
effect.  A trial was held in November 2010.  On November 7, 2011, the Court
determined that we had a continuing right to allocate the annual rent to unexpired
leases covered by the Master Agreement and Guaranty, and directed entry of a
judgment in our favor ordering Stop & Shop to pay us the unpaid annual rent
accrued through February 28, 2011 in the amount of $37,422,000, a portion of
the annual rent due from March 1, 2011 through the date of judgment, interest,
and attorneys’ fees.  On December 16, 2011, a money judgment based on the
Court’s decision was entered in our favor in the amount of $56,597,000
(including interest and costs).  Stop & Shop appealed the Court’s decision
and the judgment and posted a bond to secure payment of the judgment. On
January 12, 2012, we commenced a new action against Stop & Shop seeking
recovery of $2,500,000 of annual rent not included in the money judgment, plus
additional annual rent as it accrues.  At December 31, 2012, we had a
$47,900,000 receivable from Stop & Shop, which is included as a component
of “tenant and other receivables” on our consolidated balance sheet.  On
February 6, 2013, we received $124,000,000 pursuant to a settlement agreement
with Stop & Shop.  The settlement terminates our right to receive
$6,000,000 of additional annual rent under the 1992 agreement, for a period
potentially through 2031.  As a result of this settlement, we collected the aforementioned
$47,900,000 receivable and will recognize approximately $59,000,000 of net
income in the first quarter of 2013.

Funds From Operations (“FFO”)

FFO is computed in
accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”).  NAREIT
defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales
of depreciated real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation
and amortization expense from real estate assets, extraordinary items and other
specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of
unconsolidated subsidiaries.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by
management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of
operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes
the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales,
which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of
real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on
existing market conditions.  FFO does not represent cash generated from
operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to
fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net
income as a performance measure or cash flows as a liquidity measure.  FFO may
not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

FFO attributable to common shareholders plus
assumed conversions was $818,565,000, or $4.39 per diluted share for the year
ended December 31, 2012, compared to $1,230,973,000, or $6.42 per diluted share
for the year ended December 31, 2011. FFO attributable to common shareholders
plus assumed conversions was $55,890,000, or $0.30 per diluted share for the
three months ended December 31, 2012, compared to $280,369,000, or $1.46 per
diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2011.  Details of certain
items that affect comparability are discussed in the financial results summary
of our “Overview.”

We have exposure to fluctuations in market
interest rates. Market interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are
beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest rates on our

We may utilize various financial instruments to
mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and
earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the
interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. As of December
31, 2012, we have one interest rate cap with a principal amount of $60,000,000
and a weighted average interest rate of 2.36%.  This cap is based on a notional
amount of $60,000,000 and caps LIBOR at a rate of 7.00%.  In addition, we have
one interest rate swap on a $425,000,000 mortgage loan that swapped the rate
from LIBOR plus 2.00% (2.21% at December 31, 2012) to a fixed rate of 5.13% for
the remaining six-year term of the loan.

Fair Value of Debt

The estimated fair value of our consolidated debt
is calculated based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at the
current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar
credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt.  As of December 31, 2012,
the estimated fair value of our consolidated debt was $11,433,000,000.

Derivative Instruments

We have, and may in the future enter into,
derivative positions that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment,
including our economic interest in J.C. Penney common shares.  Because these
derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses
resulting from their mark-to-market at the end of each reporting period are
recognized as an increase or decrease in “interest and other investment income
(loss), net” on our consolidated statements of income. In addition, we are, and
may in the future be, subject to additional expense based on the notional
amount of the derivative positions and a specified spread over LIBOR. Because
the market value of these instruments can vary significantly between periods,
we may experience significant fluctuations in the amount of our investment
income or expense in any given period.  In the years ended December 31, 2012
and 2011, we recognized a loss of $75,815,000 and income of $12,984,000,
respectively, from derivative instruments.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board of Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vornado Realty Trust (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Vornado Realty Trust at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Accounting Policies

Basis of
Presentation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vornado
and the Operating Partnership. All inter-company amounts have been eliminated.
We account for unconsolidated partially owned entities under the equity method
of accounting, when we have the ability to exercise significant influence over
the entity.  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting
Literature

In May 2011, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Update No. 2011-04,

Fair Value
Measurements (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement
and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS

(“ASU No. 2011-04”).  ASU
No. 2011-04 provides a uniform framework for fair value measurements and
related disclosures between GAAP and International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”) and requires additional disclosures, including:
(i) quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, a description
of the valuation processes used, and a qualitative discussion about the
sensitivity of the measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs, for
Level 3 fair value measurements; (ii) fair value of financial instruments not
measured at fair value but for which disclosure of fair value is required,
based on their levels in the fair value hierarchy; and (iii) transfers
between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  The adoption of this
update on January 1, 2012 did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements, but resulted in additional fair value measurement
disclosures (See Note 13 - Fair Value Measurements).

Significant
Accounting Policies

Real
Estate:

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly
related to the improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized. Maintenance
and repairs are expensed as incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating
properties, the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment
plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with
the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the
property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property
when complete. If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the
undepreciated net book value of the property carried forward, exceeds the
estimated fair value of redeveloped property, the excess is charged to expense.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives
which range from 7 to 40 years. Tenant allowances are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximate the
useful lives of the assets. Additions to real estate include interest expense
capitalized during construction of $16,801,000 and $1,197,000 for the years
ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess
the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements,
identified intangibles, such as acquired above and below-market leases and
acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and
we allocate the purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value
based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and
capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future
cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating
results, known trends, and market/economic conditions.  We record acquired
intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases, tenant relationships
and acquired in-place leases) and acquired intangible liabilities (including
below–market leases) at their estimated fair value separate and apart from
goodwill. We amortize identified intangibles that have finite lives over the
period they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future
cash flows of the property or business acquired.

Our properties, including any related intangible
assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists
when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future
cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis.  An
impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying
amount over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on our
current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the
time the analyses are prepared.  If our estimates of the projected future cash
flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change, our evaluation
of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to
our consolidated financial statements.  The evaluation of anticipated cash
flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future
occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially
from actual results.  Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the
likelihood of recording impairment losses.  The table below summarizes the
impairment losses, acquisition related costs and tenant buy-outs in the years
ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Partially Owned Entities:

We
consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest.  In
determining whether we have a controlling financial interest in a partially
owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we
consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management
representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive
participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a
variable interest entity (“VIE”) and we are the primary beneficiary.  We are
deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct the
activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic
performance and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could
potentially be significant to the VIE. We generally do not control a partially
owned entity if the entity is not considered a VIE and the approval of all of
the partners/members is contractually required with respect to major decisions,
such as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange or other disposition
of real property, the hiring of a chief executive officer, the commencement,
compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or arbitration or the
placement of new or additional financing secured by assets of the venture.  We
account for investments under the equity method when the requirements for
consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the
operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at
cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash
contributions and distributions each period. Investments that do not qualify
for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost
method.

Investments in partially owned entities are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured
based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated
fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding
periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared.  In
the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recognized non-cash
impairment losses on investments in partially owned entities, excluding Toys,
aggregating $4,936,000, $13,794,000 and $11,481,000, respectively.

Mortgage and Mezzanine Loans Receivable:

We invest in mortgage and mezzanine loans of entities that have significant
real estate assets.  These investments are either secured by the real property
or by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying
real estate.  We record these investments at the stated principal amount net of
any unamortized discount or premium. We accrete or amortize any discount or
premium over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective
interest method or straight-line method, if the result is not materially
different.  We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of
each of our loans whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such
amounts may not be recoverable. A loan is impaired when it is probable that we
will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual
terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by
comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or
as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is
collateral dependent.  Interest on impaired loans is recognized when received
in cash.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash
equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due
to their short-term maturities.  The majority of our cash and cash equivalents consists
of (i) deposits at major commercial banks, which may at times exceed the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit, (ii) United States Treasury Bills,
and (iii) Certificate of Deposits placed through an Account Registry Service
(“CDARS”).  To date, we have not experienced any losses on our invested cash.

Restricted
Cash:

Restricted cash consists of
security deposits, cash restricted in connection with our deferred compensation
plan and cash escrowed under loan agreements for debt service, real estate
taxes, property insurance and capital improvements.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts:

We
periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and
maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from
the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements.
We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining
of rents. This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts
currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in
establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit
status in developing these estimates.  As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had
$37,674,000 and $43,241,000, respectively, in allowances for doubtful
accounts.  In addition, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had $3,165,000 and
$3,290,000, respectively, in allowances for receivables arising from the
straight-lining of rents.

Deferred
Charges:

Direct financing costs are
deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements as a component
of interest expense. Direct costs related to successful leasing activities are
capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the lives of the
related leases. All other deferred charges are amortized on a straight line
basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, in accordance
with the terms of the agreements to which they relate.

Stock-Based Compensation:

Stock-based
compensation consists of awards to certain employees and officers and consists
of stock options, restricted stock, restricted Operating Partnership units and
out-performance plan awards.  We account for all stock-based compensation in
accordance with ASC 718,

Compensation – Stock Compensation

Revenue Recognition:

We have the following revenue sources and revenue
recognition policies:

•      Base Rent — income
arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable
term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects
of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.  We commence rental revenue
recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased
space is substantially ready for its intended use.  In addition, in circumstances
where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned
by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

•      Percentage Rent —
income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon tenant sales
exceeding defined thresholds. These rents are recognized only after the
contingency has been removed (i.e., when tenant sales thresholds have been
achieved).

•      Hotel Revenue —
income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of
rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is
recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue is
recognized when the services have been rendered.

•      Trade Shows Revenue —
income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths.
This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred.

•      Expense
Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the
recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of
the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the
expenses are incurred.

•      Management, Leasing
and Other Fees — income arising from contractual agreements with third parties
or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related
services are performed under the respective agreements.

•      Cleveland Medical
Mart — revenue arising from the development of the Cleveland Medical Mart.  This
revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the
respective agreements using the criteria set forth in ASC 605-25,

Multiple
Element Arrangements

, as we are providing development, marketing, leasing,
and other property management services.

Condominium Units Held For Sale:

Condominium
units held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs
to sell and are included in “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheet. 
As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the carrying amount of these units were
$53,737,000 and $60,785,000, respectively, and consist of substantially
completed units at Granite Park in Pasadena and The Bryant in Boston.  Revenue
from condominium unit sales is recognized upon closing of the sale (the
“completed contract method”), as all conditions for full profit recognition
have been met at that time.  We use the relative sales value method to allocate
costs to individual condominium units.  Net gains on sales of condominiums
units are included in “net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially
owned assets” on our consolidated statements of income and were $1,274,000,
$5,884,000 and $3,149,000 in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.  Impairment losses on condominium units are included in
“impairment losses, acquisition related costs and tenant buy-outs” on our
consolidated statements of income and were $2,538,000, $0 and $30,013,000 in
the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities:

ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, our derivative instruments consisted primarily of a portion of our investment in J.C. Penney common shares (see Note 5 – Marketable Securities and Derivative Instruments), an interest rate cap and an interest rate swap.  We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings. We assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction. For derivatives not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.

Income Per Share:

Basic income per share is computed based on weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted income per share considers the effect of all potentially dilutive share equivalents, including outstanding employee stock options, restricted shares and convertible or redeemable securities.

Income Taxes:

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856‑860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to shareholders 100% of taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.  Dividends distributed for the year ended December 31, 2012, were characterized, for federal income tax income tax purposes, as 62.7% ordinary income and 37.3% long term capital gain.  Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2011, were characterized, for Federal income tax purposes, as 93.2% ordinary income and 6.8% long-term capital gain.  Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2010 were characterized, for Federal income tax purposes, as 95.9% ordinary income, 2.8% long-term capital gain and 1.3% return of capital.

We have elected to treat certain consolidated subsidiaries, and may in the future elect to treat newly formed subsidiaries, as taxable REIT subsidiaries pursuant to an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code that became effective January 1, 2001.  Taxable REIT subsidiaries may participate in non-real estate related activities and/or perform non-customary services for tenants and are subject to Federal and State income tax at regular corporate tax rates. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries had a combined current income tax expense of approximately $20,336,000 and $26,645,000 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and have immaterial differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities.

3.     Acquisitions

Independence
Plaza

In
2011, we acquired a 51% interest in the subordinated debt of Independence
Plaza, a three-building 1,328 unit residential complex in the Tribeca submarket
of Manhattan which has 54,500 square feet of retail space and 550 parking
spaces, for $45,000,000 and a warrant to purchase 25% of the equity for
$1,000,000.  On December 21, 2012, we acquired a 58.75% interest in the
property as follows: (i) buying one of the equity partners’ 33.75% interest for
$160,000,000, (ii) exercising our warrant for 25% of the equity and (iii)
contributing the appreciated value of our interest in the subordinated debt as
preferred equity.  In connection therewith, we recognized income of
$105,366,000, comprised of $60,396,000 from the accelerated amortization of the
discount on the subordinated debt immediately preceding the conversion to
preferred equity, and a $44,970,000 purchase price fair value adjustment upon
exercising the warrant.  The current transaction values the property at
$844,800,000.  The property is currently encumbered by a $334,225,000
mortgage.  We expect to refinance the $334,225,000 mortgage in 2013,
substantially decreasing our cash investment.  We manage the retail space
at the property and Stellar Management, our partner, manages the residential
space.  We consolidate the accounts of this entity from the date of acquisition
as it is a VIE, and we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary.  We are
currently in the process of analyzing the fair value of the acquired leases; accordingly,
our purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to change.

666 Fifth Avenue - Retail

On December 6, 2012, we
acquired a retail condominium located at 666 Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street for
$707,000,000. The property has 126 feet of frontage on Fifth Avenue and
contains 114,000 square feet, 39,000 square feet in fee and 75,000 square feet
by long-term lease from the 666 Fifth
Avenue office condominium, which is 49.5% owned by us.  We consolidate the accounts
of the property into our consolidated financial statements from the date of
acquisition.  We are currently in the process of analyzing the fair value of
the acquired leases; accordingly, our purchase price allocation is preliminary
and subject to change.

Disclosure of the Company’s
unaudited proforma information for the current and prior reporting periods as
though the above acquisitions of Independence Plaza and 666 Fifth Avenue –
Retail had occurred at the beginning of the prior annual reporting period is
not considered practicable, as the Company does not have, and is unable to
obtain, certain information required for such disclosure.

Marriott Marquis Times
Square – Retail and Signage

On July 30, 2012, we entered
into a lease with Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE: HST) (“Host”), under
which we will redevelop the retail and signage components of the Marriott
Marquis Times Square Hotel.  The Marriott Marquis with over 1,900 rooms is
one of the largest hotels in Manhattan.  It is located in the heart of the
bow-tie of Times Square and spans the entire block front from 45th Street to
46th Street on Broadway.  The Marriott Marquis is directly across from our
1540 Broadway iconic retail property leased to Forever 21 and Disney
flagship stores.  We plan to spend over $140,000,000 to redevelop and
substantially expand the existing retail space, including converting the below
grade parking garage into retail, and creating six-story, 300 foot wide block
front, dynamic LED signs.  During the term of the lease we will pay fixed
rent equal to the sum of $12,500,000, plus a portion of the property’s net cash
flow after we receive a 5.2% preferred return on our invested capital. 
The lease contains put/call options which, if exercised, would lead to our ownership. 
Host can exercise the put option during defined periods following the
conversion of the project to a condominium.  We can exercise our call
option under the same terms, at any time after the fifteenth year of the lease
term.  We are accounting for this lease as a “capital lease” and have
recorded a $240,000,000 capital lease asset and liability, which are included
as a component of “development costs and construction in progress” and “other
liabilities,” respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet.  Although
we have commenced paying the annual rent, there will be no income statement
activity until the redevelopment is substantially complete.

5.    Marketable Securities and Derivative Instruments

Our portfolio of marketable securities is
comprised of equity securities that are classified as available-for-sale. 
Available-for-sale securities are presented on our consolidated balance sheets
at fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses resulting from the mark-to-market
of these securities are included in “other comprehensive (loss) income.” 
Realized gains and losses are recognized in earnings only upon the sale of the
securities and are recorded based on the weighted average cost of such
securities.

During 2012, 2011 and 2010 we sold certain marketable
securities for aggregate proceeds of $58,718,000, $69,559,000, and
$281,486,000, respectively resulting in net gains of $3,582,000, $5,020,000,
and $22,604,000, respectively, which are included as a component of “net gain
on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets” on our consolidated
statements of income.

We evaluate our portfolio of marketable
securities for impairment each reporting period.  For each of the securities in
our portfolio with unrealized losses, we review the underlying cause of the
decline in value and the estimated recovery period, as well as the severity and
duration of the decline.  In our evaluation, we consider our ability and intent
to hold these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for us to
recover our cost basis.  We also evaluate the near-term prospects for each of
these investments in relation to the severity and duration of the decline.  In
the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized a $224,937,000 impairment loss
on our investment in J.C. Penney (see below).  No impairment losses were
recognized in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.

Investment in J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (“J.C. Penney”)
(NYSE: JCP)

We own 23,400,000 J.C. Penney common
shares, or 10.7% of its outstanding common shares.  Below are the details of
our investment.

We own 18,584,010 common shares at an
average economic cost of $25.76 per share, or $478,691,000 in the aggregate.  Of
these shares, 15,500,000 were acquired through the exercise of a call option in
November 2010.  Upon the exercise of the call option, we recognized
$112,537,000 of income, which increased the GAAP cost of these shares to
$591,228,000.  As of December 31, 2012, based on J.C. Penney’s December 31,
2012 closing share price of $19.71 per share, these shares have an aggregate
fair value of $366,291,000, or $224,937,000 below our GAAP basis.  We have
concluded that our investment in J.C. Penney is “other-than-temporarily”
impaired and have recorded a $224,937,000 impairment loss in the fourth
quarter.  Our conclusion was based on the severity of the decline in the stock
price and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near term.

We also own an economic interest in
4,815,990 J.C. Penney common shares through a forward contract at a weighted
average strike price of $29.10 per share, or $140,138,000 in the aggregate. 
The forward contract was amended on October 8, 2012, such that, among other
things, the contract may be settled, at our election, in cash or common shares,
in whole or in part, at any time prior to October 9, 2014, or any anniversary
thereof, or in the event we were to receive a credit downgrade.  The forward
contract strike price increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 95 basis points
during the first two years of the contract and LIBOR plus 80 basis points
thereafter.  The contract is a derivative instrument that does not qualify for
hedge accounting treatment.  Gains and losses from the mark-to-market of the
underlying common shares are recognized in “interest and other investment (loss)
income, net” on our consolidated statements of income.  In the year ended
December 31, 2012, we recognized a loss of $75,815,000 from the mark-to-market
of the underlying common shares. In the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010,
we recognized gains of $12,984,000 and $17,616,000, respectively, from the
mark-to-market of the underlying common shares.

We review our investment in J.C. Penney on
a continuing basis.  Depending on various factors, including, without
limitation, J.C. Penney’s financial position and strategic direction, actions
taken by its board, price levels of its common shares, other investment
opportunities available to us, market conditions and general economic and
industry conditions, we may take such actions with respect to J.C. Penney as we
deem appropriate, including (i) purchasing additional common shares or other
financial instruments related to J.C. Penney, (ii) selling some or all of our
beneficial or economic holdings, or (iii) engaging in hedging or similar
transactions.

Toys “R” Us (“Toys”)

As of December 31, 2012, we own 32.6% of Toys. 
The business of Toys is highly seasonal.  Historically, Toys’ fourth quarter
net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income.  We
account for our investment in Toys under the equity method and record our 32.6%
share of Toys net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because Toys’
fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, and our fiscal year ends
on December 31.

Since our acquisition in July 2005, the carrying
amount of our investment has grown from $396,000,000 to $518,041,000 after we
recognized our share of Toys third quarter net loss in our fourth quarter.  We
estimate that the fair value of our investment is approximately $478,000,000 at
December 31, 2012.  We have concluded that the $40,000,000 decline in the value
of our investment is “other-than-temporary” based on, among other factors,
compression of earnings multiples of comparable retailers and our inability to
forecast a recovery in the near term.  Accordingly, we recognized a non-cash
impairment loss of $40,000,000 in the fourth quarter.

We will continue to assess the recoverability of
our investment each quarter.  To the extent that the current facts don’t
change, we would recognize a non-cash impairment loss equal to our share of
Toys fourth quarter net income in our 2013 first quarter.

Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”)
(NYSE: ALX)

As of December 31, 2012, we own 1,654,068
Alexander’s commons shares, or approximately 32.4% of Alexander’s common
equity.  We manage, lease and develop Alexander’s properties pursuant to the
agreements described below which expire in March of each year and are
automatically renewable.  As of December 31, 2012, Alexander’s owed us an
aggregate of $46,445,000 pursuant to such agreements.

On November 28, 2012, Alexander’s completed the
sale of its Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center located in Brooklyn, New York,
for $751,000,000.  Upon completion of the sale, we recognized our share of the
financial statement gain of $179,934,000.  Alexander’s distributed the taxable
gain to its stockholders in December 2012 as a special long-term capital gain
dividend, of which our share was $201,796,000, and we in turn paid a $1.00 per
Vornado share special long-term capital gain dividend to our common
shareholders in December 2012.

As of December 31, 2012 the market value (“fair
value” pursuant to ASC 820) of our investment in Alexander’s, based on
Alexander’s December 31, 2012 closing share price of $330.80, was $547,166,000,
or $376,153,000 in excess of the carrying amount on our consolidated balance
sheet.  As of December 31, 2012, the carrying amount of our investment in
Alexander’s, excluding amounts owed to us, exceeds our share of the equity in
the net assets of Alexander’s by approximately $43,383,000.  The majority of
this basis difference resulted from the excess of our purchase price for the
Alexander’s common stock acquired over the book value of Alexander’s net
assets.  Substantially all of this basis difference was allocated, based on our
estimates of the fair values of Alexander’s assets and liabilities, to real
estate (land and buildings).  We are amortizing the basis difference related to
the buildings into earnings as additional depreciation expense over their
estimated useful lives.  This depreciation is not material to our share of
equity in Alexander’s net income.  The basis difference related to the land
will be recognized upon disposition of our investment.

Management and Development Agreements

Effective December 1, 2012, as a result of the
sale of the Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center, the management and
development agreement with Alexander’s was amended.  Pursuant to the amended
agreement, we receive an annual fee for managing Alexander’s and all of its
properties equal to the sum of (i) $2,800,000, (ii) 2% of the gross income
from the Rego Park II Shopping Center, (iii) $0.50 per square foot of the
tenant-occupied office and retail space at 731 Lexington Avenue, and (iv)
$264,000, escalating at 3% per annum, for managing the common area of 731
Lexington Avenue.

In addition, we are entitled to a development fee
of 6% of development costs, as defined.

Leasing Agreements

We provide Alexander’s with leasing services for
a fee of 3% of rent for the first ten years of a lease term, 2% of rent for the
eleventh through twentieth year of a lease term and 1% of rent for the
twenty-first through thirtieth year of a lease term, subject to the payment of
rents by Alexander’s tenants.  In the event third-party real estate brokers are
used, our fee increases by 1% and we are responsible for the fees to the
third-parties.  We are also entitled to a commission upon the sale of any of
Alexander’s assets equal to 3% of gross proceeds, as defined, for asset sales
less than $50,000,000, or 1% of gross proceeds, as defined, for asset sales of
$50,000,000 or more.  The total of these amounts is payable to us in annual
installments in an amount not to exceed $4,000,000 with interest on the unpaid
balance at one-year LIBOR plus 1.0% (2.13% at December 31, 2012).  As a result
of the sale of Kings Plaza, we earned a $6,423,000 sales commission, which is
net of a third party broker fee.

Other Agreements

Building Maintenance Services (“BMS”), our
wholly-owned subsidiary, supervises the cleaning, engineering and security
services at Alexander’s 731 Lexington Avenue property for an annual fee of the
costs for such services plus 6%.  During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011
and 2010, we recognized $2,934,000, $2,970,000 and $2,775,000 of income,
respectively, under these agreements.

Lexington
Realty Trust (“Lexington”) (NYSE: LXP)

As
of December 31,

2012, we own 18,468,969
Lexington common shares, or approximately 10.5% of Lexington’s common equity. 
We account for our investment in Lexington on the equity method because we
believe we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Lexington’s operating and financial policies, based on, among other factors, our

representation
on Lexington’s Board of Trustees and the level of our ownership in Lexington as compared to other shareholders.  We record our pro rata share of Lexington’s
net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because we file our consolidated
financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that Lexington
files its financial statements.

Based
on Lexington’s December 31, 2012

closing share
price of $10.45, the market value (“fair value” pursuant to ASC 820) of our
investment in Lexington was $193,001,000, or $117,459,000 in excess of the
December 31, 2012 carrying amount on our consolidated balance

sheet.  As
of December 31, 2012, the carrying amount of our investment in Lexington was
less than our share of the equity in the net assets of Lexington by

approximately $31,427,000.

This basis
difference resulted primarily from $107,882,000 of non-cash impairment charges
recognized during 2008, partially offset by purchase accounting for our
acquisition of an additional 8,000,000 common shares of Lexington in October
2008, of which the majority relates to our estimate of the fair values of
Lexington’s real estate (land and buildings) as compared to the carrying
amounts in Lexington’s consolidated financial statements.  The basis difference
related to the buildings is being amortized over their estimated useful lives
as an adjustment to our equity in net income or loss of Lexington.  This
amortization is not material to our share of equity in Lexington’s net income
or loss.  The basis difference attributable to the land will be recognized upon
disposition of our investment.

LNR Property Corporation (“LNR”)

On January 24, 2013, LNR entered into a definitive agreement
to be sold.  We own 26.2% of LNR and expect to receive net proceeds of
$241,000,000.  The sale, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is
expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2013.

As of December 31, 2012, we own a 26.2% equity interest in
LNR.  We account for our investment in LNR under the equity method and record
our 26.2% share of LNR’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because
we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to
receiving LNR’s consolidated financial statements.

LNR consolidates certain commercial mortgage-backed
securities (“CMBS”) and Collateralized Debt Obligation (“CDO”) trusts for which
it is the primary beneficiary.  The assets of these trusts (primarily
commercial mortgage loans), which aggregate approximately $97 billion as of
September 30, 2012, are the sole source of repayment of the related
liabilities, which are non-recourse to LNR and its equity holders, including
us.  Changes in the fair value of these assets each period are offset by
changes in the fair value of the related liabilities through LNR’s consolidated
income statement.  As of December 31, 2012, the carrying amount of our
investment in LNR does not materially differ from our share of LNR’s equity.

(1)

Represents the extended maturity for certain loans in which we have the unilateral right, ability and intent to extend.

(2)

On November 8, 2012, we completed a $950,000 refinancing of this property. The 10-year fixed rate interest-only loan bears interest at 3.34%. The partnership retained net proceeds of approximately $522,000, after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.

(3)

On January 9, 2012, we completed a $300,000 refinancing of this property. The five-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 3.75% and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the third year. The proceeds of the new loan and $132,000 of existing cash were used to repay the existing loan and closing costs.

(4)

In the first quarter of 2012, we notified the lender that due to scheduled lease expirations resulting primarily from the effects of the Base Realignment and Closure statute, the Skyline properties had a 26% vacancy rate and rising (49.8% as of December 31, 2012) and, accordingly, cash flows are expected to decrease. As a result, our subsidiary that owns these properties does not have and is not expected to have for some time sufficient funds to pay all of its current obligations, including interest payments to the lender. Based on the projected vacancy and the significant amount of capital required to re-tenant these properties, at our request, the mortgage loan was transferred to the special servicer. In the second quarter of 2012, we entered into a forbearance agreement with the special servicer to apply cash flows of the property, before interest on the loan, towards the repayment of $4,000 of tenant improvements and leasing commissions we funded in connection with a new lease at these properties, which was repaid in the third quarter. The forbearance agreement was amended January 31, 2013, to extend its maturity through April 1, 2013 and provides for interest shortfalls to be deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan and not give rise to a loan default. As of December 31, 2012, the deferred interest amounted to $26,957. We continue to negotiate with the special servicer to restructure the terms of the loan.

(5)

On July 26, 2012, we completed a $150,000 refinancing of this property. The 12-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 3.97% and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the third year.

(6)

On March 5, 2012, we completed a $325,000 refinancing of this property. The three-year loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% and has two one-year extension options. We retained net proceeds of approximately $87,000, after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.

(7)

On November 16, 2012, we completed a $120,000 refinancing of this property. The seven-year loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.15% and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the third year. We retained net proceeds of approximately $42,000, after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.

(8)

On August 17, 2012, we completed a $98,000 refinancing of this property. The seven-year loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.25%. We retained net proceeds of approximately $44,000, after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.

Noncontrolling Interests

Redeemable noncontrolling interests on our
consolidated balance sheets represent Operating Partnership units held by third
parties and are comprised of Class A units and Series D-15 and D-16 cumulative
redeemable preferred units.  Class A units may be tendered for redemption to
the Operating Partnership for cash; we, at our option, may assume that
obligation and pay the holder either cash or Vornado common shares on a
one-for-one basis.  Because the number of Vornado common shares outstanding at
all times equals the number of Class A units owned by Vornado, the redemption
value of each Class A unit is equivalent to the market value of one Vornado
common share, and the quarterly distribution to a Class A unitholder is equal
to the quarterly dividend paid to a Vornado common shareholder.  Below are the
details of Operating Partnership units held by third-parties that are included
in “redeemable noncontrolling interests” as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.

underwriters’ discounts and issuance costs and contributed the net proceeds to
the Operating Partnership in exchange for 12,000,000 Series K Preferred Units
(with economic terms that mirror those of the Series K Preferred Shares). 
Dividends on the Series K Preferred Shares are cumulative and payable quarterly
in arrears.  The Series K Preferred Shares are not convertible into, or
exchangeable for, any of our properties or securities.  On or after five years
from the date of issuance (or sooner under limited circumstances), we may
redeem the Series K Preferred Shares at a redemption price of $25.00 per share,
plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the date of redemption. The Series K
Preferred Shares have no maturity date and will remain outstanding indefinitely
unless redeemed by us.

On August 16, 2012, we redeemed all of the

13.  Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurement and
Disclosures

defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring
fair value.  The objective of fair value is to determine the price that would
be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the
exit price).

ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into
three levels: Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are
accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities; Level 2 – observable
prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated
by market data; and Level 3 – unobservable inputs that are used when little or
no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest
priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In
determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use
of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent
possible, as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of
fair value.  Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret Level 2 and 3
inputs in determining the fair value of our financial and non-financial assets
and liabilities.  Accordingly, our fair value estimates, which are made at the
end of each reporting period, may be different than the amounts that may
ultimately be realized upon sale or disposition of these assets.

Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at
Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Financial assets and liabilities that are
measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets consist of (i)
marketable securities, (ii) Real Estate Fund investments, (iii) the assets in
our deferred compensation plan (for which there is a corresponding liability on
our consolidated balance sheet), (iv) derivative positions in marketable equity
securities, (v) interest rate swaps and (vi) mandatorily redeemable instruments
(Series G-1 through G-4 convertible preferred units and Series D-13 cumulative
redeemable preferred units).  The tables below aggregate the fair values of
these financial assets and liabilities by their levels in the fair value
hierarchy at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

reviewed by senior management at each reporting period.  The discounted cash
flow valuation technique requires us to estimate cash flows for each investment
over the anticipated holding period, which currently ranges from 1.6 to 6.2
years.  Cash flows are derived from property rental revenue (base rents plus
reimbursements) less operating expenses, real estate taxes and capital and
other costs, plus projected sales proceeds in the year of exit.  Property
rental revenue is based on leases currently in place and our estimates for
future leasing activity, which are based on current market rents for similar
space plus a projected growth factor.  Similarly, estimated operating expenses
and real estate taxes are based on amounts incurred in the current period plus
a projected growth factor for future periods.  Anticipated sales proceeds at
the end of an investment’s expected holding period are determined based on the
net cash flow of the investment in the year of exit, divided by a terminal
capitalization rate, less estimated selling costs.

The fair value
of each property is calculated by discounting the future cash flows (including
the projected sales proceeds), using an appropriate discount rate and then
reduced by the property’s outstanding debt, if any, to determine the fair value
of the equity in each investment. Significant unobservable quantitative inputs
used in determining the fair value of each investment include capitalization
rates and discount rates.  These rates are based on the location, type and
nature of each property, and current and anticipated market conditions, which
are derived from original underwriting assumptions, industry publications and
from the experience of our Acquisitions and Capital Markets departments. 
Significant unobservable quantitative inputs in the table below were utilized
in determining the fair value of these Fund investments at December 31,
2012.

The above inputs are subject to change based on
changes in economic and market conditions and/or changes in use or timing of
exit.  Changes in discount rates and terminal capitalization rates result in
increases or decreases in the fair values of these investments.  The discount
rates encompass, among other things, uncertainties in the valuation models with
respect to terminal capitalization rates and the amount and timing of cash
flows.  Therefore, a change in the fair value of these investments resulting from
a change in the terminal capitalization rate, may be partially offset by a
change in the discount rate.  It is not possible for us to predict the effect
of future economic or market conditions on our estimated fair values.

Deferred Compensation Plan Assets

Deferred compensation plan assets that are classified as Level 3 consist of investments in limited partnerships and investment funds, which are managed by third parties.  We receive quarterly financial reports from a third-party administrator, which are compiled from the quarterly reports provided to them from each limited partnership and investment fund.  The quarterly reports provide net asset values on a fair value basis which are audited by independent public accounting firms on an annual basis.  The third-party administrator does not adjust these values in determining our share of the net assets and we do not adjust these values when reported in our consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Measurements on a Nonrecurring Basis

Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on our consolidated balance sheets consist primarily of our investment in Toys "R" Us and real estate assets that have been written-down to estimated fair value during 2012 and 2011.  See Note 2 –

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

for details of impairment losses recognized during 2012 and 2011.  The fair values of these assets are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including (i) discounted cash flow analysis, which considers, among other things, leasing assumptions, growth rates, discount rates and terminal capitalization rates, (ii) income capitalization approach, which considers prevailing market capitalization rates, and (iii) comparable sales activity.  Generally, we consider multiple valuation techniques when measuring fair values but in certain circumstances, a single valuation technique may be appropriate.  The tables below aggregate the fair values of these assets by their levels in the fair value hierarchy.

Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value

Financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets include cash equivalents (primarily U.S. Treasury Bills), mortgage and mezzanine loans receivable and our secured and unsecured debt.  Estimates of the fair value of these instruments are determined by the standard practice of modeling the contractual cash flows required under the instrument and discounting them back to their present value at the appropriate current risk adjusted interest rate, which is provided by a third-party specialist.  For floating rate debt, we use forward rates derived from observable market yield curves to project the expected cash flows we would be required to make under the instrument.  The fair value of cash equivalents is classified as Level 1 and the fair value of our mortgage and mezzanine loans receivable is classified as Level 3.  The fair value of our secured and unsecured debt are classified as Level 2.

).  We are required to consolidate our interests in this entity because we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly affect economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses and right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity.

We are not required to consolidate our interest in this entity because we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary and the nature of our involvement in the activities of the entity does not give us power over decisions that significantly affect the entity’s economic performance.  We account for our interest in the entity under the equity method of accounting (see Note 6 –

Investments in Partially Owned Entities

).  As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the carrying amount of our investment in this entity was $8,775,000 and $2,715,000, respectively, and our maximum exposure to loss is limited to our investment in the entity.

15.    Stock-based Compensation

Our
Omnibus Share Plan (the “Plan”), which was approved in May 2010, provides the
Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Committee”) the ability to grant
incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted
Operating Partnership units and out-performance plan rewards to certain of our
employees and officers.  Under the Plan, awards may be granted up to a maximum
of 6,000,000 shares, if all awards granted are Full Value Awards, as defined,
and up to 12,000,000 shares, if all of the awards granted are Not Full Value
Awards, as defined, plus shares in respect of awards forfeited after May 2010
that were issued pursuant to our 2002 Omnibus Share Plan.  Full Value Awards
are awards of securities, such as restricted shares, that, if all vesting
requirements are met, do not require the payment of an exercise price or strike
price to acquire the securities.  Not Full Value Awards are awards of
securities, such as options, that do require the payment of an exercise price
or strike price.  This means, for example, if the Committee were to award only
restricted shares, it could award up to 6,000,000 restricted shares.  On the
other hand, if the Committee were to award only stock options, it could award
options to purchase up to 12,000,000 shares (at the applicable exercise
price).  The Committee may also issue any combination of awards under the Plan,
with reductions in availability of future awards made in accordance with the
above limitations.  As of December 31, 2012, we have approximately

5,136,000

shares available for future grants under
the Plan, if all awards granted are Full Value Awards, as defined.

On March 30, 2012, the
Committee approved the 2012 formulaic annual incentive program for our senior
executive management team.  Under the program, our senior executive
management team, including our Chairman and our President and Chief Executive
Officer, will have the ability to earn annual incentive payments (cash or
equity) if and only if we achieve comparable funds from operations (“Comparable
FFO”) of at least 80% or more of the prior year Comparable FFO.  Moreover,
even if we achieve the stipulated Comparable FFO performance requirement, the
Committee retains the right, consistent with best practices, to elect to make
no payments under the program.  Comparable FFO excludes the impact of
certain non-recurring items such as income or loss from discontinued
operations, the sale or mark-to-market of marketable securities or derivatives
and early extinguishment of debt, restructuring costs and non-cash impairment
losses, among others, and thus the Committee believes provides a better metric
than total FFO for assessing management’s performance for the year.  Aggregate
incentive awards earned under the program are subject to a cap of 1.25% of
Comparable FFO for the year, with individual award allocations determined by
the Committee based on an assessment of individual and overall performance.

In
the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recognized an aggregate of
$30,588,000, $28,853,000 and $34,614,000, respectively, of stock-based
compensation expense, which is included as a component of “general and
administrative” expenses on our consolidated statements of income.  The details
of the various components of our stock-based compensation are discussed below.

Out-Performance Plans (“OPP Units”)

On March 30, 2012, the
Committee also approved the 2012 Out-Performance Plan, a multi-year,
performance-based equity compensation plan (the “2012 OPP”).  The
aggregate notional amount of the 2012 OPP is $40,000,000.  Under the 2012 OPP,
participants, including our Chairman and our President and Chief Executive
Officer, have the opportunity to earn compensation payable in the form of
equity awards if and only if we outperform a predetermined total shareholder
return (“TSR”) and/or outperform the market with respect to a relative TSR in
any year during a three-year performance period.   Specifically,
awards under our 2012 OPP may be earned if we (i) achieve a TSR above that
of the SNL US REIT Index (the “Index”) over a one-year, two-year or three-year
performance period (the “Relative Component”), and/or (ii) achieve a TSR
level greater than 7% per annum, or 21% over the three-year performance period
(the “Absolute Component”).  To the extent awards would be earned under
the Absolute Component of the 2012 OPP but we underperform the Index, such
awards would be reduced (and potentially fully negated) based on the degree to
which we underperform the Index.  In certain circumstances, in the event
we outperform the Index but awards would not otherwise be earned under the
Absolute Component, awards may still be earned under the Relative Component. 
To the extent awards would otherwise be earned under the Relative Component but
we fail to achieve at least a 6% per annum absolute TSR level, such awards
would be reduced based on our absolute TSR performance, with no awards being
earned in the event our TSR during the applicable measurement period is 0% or
negative, irrespective of the degree to which we may outperform the
Index.  If the designated performance objectives are achieved, OPP Units
are also subject to time-based vesting requirements. Dividends on awards issued
accrue during the performance period and are paid to participants if and only
if awards are ultimately earned based on the achievement of the designated performance
objectives.  Awards earned under the 2012 OPP vest 33% in year three, 33% in
year four and 34% in year five.  The fair value of the 2012 OPP on the date of
grant, as adjusted for estimated forfeitures, was $12,250,000, and is being
amortized into expense over a five-year period from the date of grant, using a
graded vesting attribution model.

In
the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recognized $2,826,000,
$740,000 and $5,062,000, respectively, of compensation expense related to OPP
Units.  As of December 31, 2012, there was $9,435,000 of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to OPP Units, which will be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 2.2 years.  Distributions paid on unvested OPP Units
are charged to “net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the
Operating Partnership” on our consolidated statements of income and amounted to
$8,000, $32,000 and $815,000 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

20.  Leases

As lessor:

We lease space to tenants under operating leases.
Most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base rentals payable
monthly in advance. Office building leases generally require the tenants to
reimburse us for operating costs and real estate taxes above their base year
costs. Shopping center leases provide for pass-through to tenants the tenant’s
share of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance. Shopping center leases
also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rent based on a
percentage of the tenants’ sales. As of December 31, 2012, future base rental
revenue under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding rents for leases with
an original term of less than one year and rents resulting from the exercise of
renewal options, are as follows:

These

percentage rents approximated $8,466,000, $7,995,000 and $7,339,000, for the
years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

None
of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the
years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Former
Bradlees Locations

Pursuant
to a Master Agreement and Guaranty, dated May 1, 1992, we were due $5,000,000 of
annual rent from Stop & Shop which was allocated to certain Bradlees former
locations.  On December 31, 2002, prior to the expiration of the leases to
which the additional rent was allocated, we reallocated this rent to other
former Bradlees leases also guaranteed by Stop & Shop.  Stop & Shop contested
our right to reallocate the rent.  On November 7, 2011, the Court determined
that we had a continuing right to allocate the annual rent to unexpired leases
covered by the Master Agreement and Guaranty and directed entry of a judgment
in our favor ordering Stop & Shop to pay us the unpaid annual rent.  At
December 31, 2012, we had a $47,900,000 receivable from Stop and Shop, which is
included as a component of “tenant and other receivables” on our consolidated
balance sheet.  On February 6, 2013, we received $124,000,000 pursuant to a
settlement agreement with Stop & Shop (see Note 22 –

property.  Capitalized leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
estimated life of the asset or life of the related lease.  Depreciation expense
on capital leases is included in “depreciation and amortization” on our

21.  Multiemployer
Benefit Plans

Our
subsidiaries make contributions to certain multiemployer defined benefit plans
(“Multiemployer Pension Plans”) and health plans (“Multiemployer Health Plans”)
for our union represented employees, pursuant to the respective collective
bargaining agreements.

Multiemployer
Pension Plans

Multiemployer
Pension Plans differ from single-employer pension plans in that (i)
contributions to multiemployer plans may be used to provide benefits to
employees of other participating employers and (ii) if other participating
employers fail to make their contributions, each of our participating
subsidiaries may be required to bear its then pro rata share of unfunded
obligations.  If a participating subsidiary withdraws from a plan in which it
participates, it may be subject to a withdrawal liability.  As of December 31, 2012,
our subsidiaries’ participation in these plans were not significant to our
consolidated financial statements.

In
the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, our subsidiaries contributed
$10,683,000, $10,168,000 and $9,629,000, respectively, towards Multiemployer
Pension Plans, which is included as a component of “operating” expenses on our
consolidated statements of income.  Our subsidiaries’ contributions did not
represent more than 5% of total employer contributions in any of these plans
for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Multiemployer
Health Plans

Multiemployer
Health Plans in which our subsidiaries participate provide health benefits to
eligible active and retired employees.  In the years ended December 31, 2012,
2011 and 2010, our subsidiaries contributed $26,759,000, $23,847,000 and
$21,664,000, respectively, towards these plans, which is included as a
component of “operating” expenses on our consolidated statements of income.

22.  Commitments and Contingencies

Insurance

We maintain general
liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all risk
property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence,
including coverage for terrorist acts, with sub-limits for certain perils such
as floods.  Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage
of $180,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of
the value of the affected property, up to a $180,000,000 annual aggregate.

Penn Plaza Insurance
Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a
re-insurer with respect to all risk property and rental value insurance and a
portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for
coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and
radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by Terrorism Risk Insurance Program
Reauthorization Act.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is
fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government
with no exposure to PPIC.  Coverage for NBCR losses is up to $2.0 billion per
occurrence, for which PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and
15% of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible
for the remaining 85% of a covered loss.  We are ultimately responsible for any
loss borne by PPIC.

We continue to monitor
the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts
of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on
commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.

Our debt instruments,
consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse
to us, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary
covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have
adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be
able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the
future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to
obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our properties and
expand our portfolio.

22.  Commitments and
Contingencies – continued

Other Commitments and
Contingencies

Our mortgage loans are
non-recourse to us.  However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or
master leased tenant space.  These guarantees and master leases terminate
either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the
underlying loans.  As of December 31, 2012, the aggregate dollar amount of
these guarantees and master leases is approximately $310,249,000.

At December 31, 2012,
$22,807,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our revolving
credit facilities.  Our credit facilities contain financial covenants that
require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market
capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a
decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain
customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and
warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise
to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or
principal.

Each of our properties
has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various
times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental
contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of
new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of
contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup
requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

Two of our wholly owned
subsidiaries that are contracted to develop and operate the Cleveland Medical
Mart and Convention Center, in Cleveland, Ohio, are required to fund $11,500,000,
primarily for tenant improvements, and they are responsible for operating
expenses and are entitled to the net operating income, if any, upon the
completion of development and the commencement of operations.  As of December
31, 2012, our subsidiaries have funded $1,100,000 of the commitment.

As of December 31,
2012, w

e expect to fund additional capital to certain
of our partially owned entities aggregating

approximately $163,130,000.

Litigation

We are from time to
time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In
our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such
matters, including the matter referred to below, is not expected to have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

In 2003, Stop &
Shop filed an action against us in the New York Supreme Court, claiming that we
had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect $5,000,000
($6,000,000 beginning February 1, 2012) of annual rent from Stop &
Shop pursuant to a Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of
the leases to which the annual rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop
asserted that an order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New
York, as modified on appeal by the District Court, froze our right to
reallocate and effectively terminated our right to collect the annual rent from
Stop & Shop.  We asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all of the
unpaid annual rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration
that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the annual rent as long as
any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in
effect.  A trial was held in November 2010.  On November 7, 2011, the Court
determined that we had a continuing right to allocate the annual rent to
unexpired leases covered by the Master Agreement and Guaranty, and directed
entry of a judgment in our favor ordering Stop & Shop to pay us the unpaid
annual rent accrued through February 28, 2011 in the amount of $37,422,000, a
portion of the annual rent due from March 1, 2011 through the date of judgment,
interest, and attorneys’ fees.  On December 16, 2011, a money judgment based on
the Court’s decision was entered in our favor in the amount of $56,597,000
(including interest and costs).  Stop & Shop appealed the Court’s decision
and the judgment and posted a bond to secure payment of the judgment. On
January 12, 2012, we commenced a new action against Stop & Shop seeking
recovery of $2,500,000 of annual rent not included in the money judgment, plus
additional annual rent as it accrues.  At December 31, 2012, we had a
$47,900,000 receivable from Stop & Shop, which is included as a component
of “tenant and other receivables” on our consolidated balance sheet.  On
February 6, 2013, we received $124,000,000 pursuant to a settlement agreement
with Stop & Shop.  The settlement terminates our right to receive
$6,000,000 of additional annual rent under the 1992 agreement, for a period
potentially through 2031.  As a result of this settlement, we collected the
aforementioned $47,900,000 receivable and will recognize approximately
$59,000,000 of net income in the first quarter of 2013.

Alexander’s

We own 32.4% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President and Chief
Executive Officer, are officers and directors of Alexander’s.  We provide
various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and
leasing agreements.  These agreements are described in Note 6 -

Investments
in Partially Owned Entities

.

Interstate Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr.
Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B.
Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s, are
Interstate’s two other partners. As of December 31, 2012, Interstate and its
partners beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 6.5% of the common
shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 26.3% of Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of
Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual
fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management
agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless
terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term. We
believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies,
that the management agreement terms are fair to us. We earned $794,000, $787,000,
and $815,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December
31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

26.    Segment Information
  - continued

Notes to preceding tabular
  information:

(1)

EBITDA represents
  "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization."
  We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing
  the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return
  on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are
  bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to
  make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets
  to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net
  income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by
  other companies.

(2)

Interest and debt expense,
  depreciation and amortization and income tax expense (benefit) in the
  reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these
  items from partially owned entities.

ITEM
9.        changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and
financial disclosure

None.

ITEM 9A.     Controls
and procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures:  Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a‑15 (e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered
by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the
end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: 
There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended) during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to which
this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Management of Vornado Realty Trust, together
with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”), is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial
officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external
reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

As of December 31, 2012, management conducted an
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework established in

Internal Control –
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined
that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 was
effective.

Our internal control over financial reporting
includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and
dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States,
and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and our trustees; and provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial
statements.

The effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report appearing on page 183, which expresses an unqualified opinion on
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2012.


REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board
of Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We have audited the
internal control over financial reporting of Vornado Realty Trust, together
with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2012,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the
company’s board of trustees, management, and other personnel to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of the inherent
limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the
internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the
risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 of the Company and our
report dated February 26, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements and financial statement schedules.
