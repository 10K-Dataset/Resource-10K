PART I

ITEM 1.          BUSINESS

The Company

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 92.5% of the common limited partnership interest in, the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2009. All references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership.

On May 14, 2009, our Board of Trustees executed its long-planned management succession strategy and elected Michael D. Fascitelli, as our Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Steven Roth, who continues to serve as Chairman of the Board.

As of December 31, 2009, we own directly or indirectly:

Office Properties

:

(i)

all or portions of 28  properties aggregating 16.2 million square feet in the New York City metropolitan area (primarily Manhattan);

(ii)         all or portions of 84 properties aggregating 18.6 million square feet in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia areas;

(iii)        a 70% controlling interest in 555 California Street, a three-building complex aggregating 1.8 million square feet in San Francisco’s financial district;

Retail Properties

:

(iv)        162 properties aggregating 22.6 million square feet, including 3.9 million square feet owned by tenants on land leased from us, primarily in Manhattan, the northeast states, California and Puerto Rico;

Merchandise Mart Properties

:

(v)         8 properties aggregating 8.9 million square feet of showroom and office space, including the 3.5 million square foot Merchandise Mart in Chicago;

Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”):

(vi)        a 32.7% interest in Toys which owns and/or operates 1,567 stores worldwide, including 851 stores in the United States and 716 stores internationally;

Other Real Estate Investments

:

(vii)       32.4% of the common stock of Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX), which has seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area;

(viii)      the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City;

(ix)         mezzanine loans on real estate; and

(x)          other real estate and investments, including marketable securities.


Objectives and Strategy

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through:

·

Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

·

Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;

·

Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

·

Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;

·

Investing in fully-integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate component; and

·

Developing and redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets.  We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities in the future.

We may also determine to raise capital for future real estate acquisitions through an institutional investment fund.  We would serve as the general partner of the fund and would also expect to be a limited partner of the fund and have the potential to earn certain incentives based on the fund’s performance.  The fund may serve as our exclusive investment vehicle for a limited period of time for all investments that fit within the fund’s investment parameters.  If we determine to raise capital through a fund, the partnership interests offered would not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and could not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under that act or an applicable exemption from those registration requirements.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

The economic recession and illiquidity and volatility in the financial and capital markets have negatively affected substantially all businesses, including ours.  Demand for office and retail space has declined nationwide due to bankruptcies, downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting.  Real estate transactions and development opportunities have significantly curtailed and capitalization rates have risen.  These trends have negatively impacted our 2008 and 2009 financial results, which include losses associated with abandoned development projects, valuation allowances on investments in mezzanine loans and impairments on other real estate investments.  The details of these non-cash charges are described in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K.  It is
 not possible for us to quantify the impact of the above trends, which may continue in 2010 and beyond, on our future financial results.

ACQUISITIONS and DISPOSITIONS

We did not make any significant investments in real estate during 2009.

On September 1, 2009, we sold 1999 K Street, a newly developed 250,000 square foot office building, in Washington’s Central Business District, for $207,800,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $41,211,000.  We also sold 15 retail properties during 2009 in separate transactions for an aggregate of $55,000,000 in cash, which resulted in net gains aggregating $4,073,000.


Financing Activities

In April 2009, we sold 17,250,000 common shares, including underwriters’ over-allotment, in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement at an initial public offering price of $43.00 per share.  We received net proceeds of $710,226,000, after underwriters’ discount and offering expenses and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 17,250,000 Class A units of the Operating Partnership.

On September 30, 2009, we completed a public offering of $460,000,000 principal amount of 7.875% callable senior unsecured 30-year notes (NYSE: VNOD) due October 1, 2039.  The notes were sold to the public at par and may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, beginning in October 2014 at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

We received net proceeds of approximately $446,000,000 from the offering which were used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes.

During 2009, we purchased $1,912,724,000 (aggregate face amount) of our convertible senior debentures and $352,740,000 (aggregate face amount) of our senior unsecured notes for $1,877,510,000 and $343,694,000 in cash, respectively.  This debt was acquired through tender offers and in the open market and has been retired.   We also repaid $650,285,000 of existing property level debt and completed $277,000,000 of property level financings.

Development and Redevelopment Projects

We are currently engaged in certain development/redevelopment projects for which we have budgeted approximately $200,000,000.  Of this amount, $78,118,000 was expended prior to 2009 and $50,513,000 was expended during 2009.  Substantially all of the estimated costs to complete these projects, aggregating approximately $71,000,000, are anticipated to be expended during 2010, of which approximately $18,000,000 will be funded by existing construction loans.  We are also evaluating other development opportunities for which final plans, budgeted costs and financing have yet to be determined.  There can be no assurance that any of our development projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed on schedule or within budget.

Segment Data

We operate in the following business segments: New York Office Properties, Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties, Merchandise Mart Properties and Toys. Financial information related to these business segments for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are set forth in Note 22 – Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The Merchandise Mart Properties segment has trade show operations in Canada and Switzerland. The Toys segment has 716 locations internationally. In addition, we have five partially owned nonconsolidated investments in real estate partnerships located in India, which are included in the Other segment.

SEASONALITY

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore comparisons of the current quarter to the previous quarter. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys’ fourth quarter net income, which we record on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. The New York and Washington, DC Office Properties and Merchandise Mart Properties segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. The Merchandise Mart Properties segment has also experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail Properties segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to 
the recognition of percentage rental income.


tenants ACCOUNTING FOR over 10% of revenues

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Certain Activities

We are not required to base our acquisitions and investments on specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for long‑term investment; however, it is possible that properties in the portfolio may be sold as circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property or property type. While we may seek the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by our Board of Trustees without the vote of shareholders.

Employees

As of December 31, 2009, we have approximately 4,597 employees, of which 308 are corporate staff. The New York Office Properties segment has 128 employees and an additional 2,512 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering services primarily to our New York Office and Washington, DC Office properties. The Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties and Merchandise Mart Properties segments have 396, 176 and 582 employees, respectively, and the Hotel Pennsylvania has 495 employees. The foregoing does not include employees of partially owned entities, including Toys or Alexander’s, in which we own 32.7% and 32.4%, respectively.

principal executive offices

Our principal executive offices are located at 888 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019; telephone (212) 894‑7000.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Material factors that may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition are summarized below.

Real Estate Investments’ Value and Income Fluctuate Due to Various Factors.

The value of real estate fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business. These conditions may also limit our revenues and available cash.

The factors that affect the value of our real estate investments include, among other things:

·

national, regional and local economic conditions;

·

competition from other available space;

·

local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area;

·

how well we manage our properties;

·

changes in market rental rates;

·

the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;

·

whether we are able to pass some or all of any increases in operating costs through to tenants;

·

changes in real estate taxes and other expenses;

·

whether tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property attractive;

·

the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;

·

availability of financing on acceptable terms or at all;

·

fluctuations in interest rates;

·

our ability to secure adequate insurance;

·

changes in taxation;

·

changes in zoning laws;

·

government regulation;

·

consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the United States;

·

natural disasters;

·

potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations; and

·

general competitive factors.

The rents we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors. If rental revenues and/or occupancy levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available to pay indebtedness and for distribution to shareholders. In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, generally do not decline when the related rents decline.

Capital markets and economic conditions can materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the value of our debt and equity securities.

There are many factors that can affect the value of our debt and equity securities, including the state of the capital markets and the economy, which have recently negatively affected substantially all businesses, including ours.  Demand for office and retail space has declined nationwide due to bankruptcies, downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting.  Real estate transactions and development opportunities have significantly curtailed and capitalization rates have risen. As a result, the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads.  Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide funding to borrowers, and this may adversely affe
ct our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants.  If these market conditions continue, they may limit our ability and the ability of our tenants, to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs which may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the value of our debt and equity securities.


Real estate is a competitive business.

Our business segments – New York Office Properties, Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties, Merchandise Mart Properties, Toys and Other – operate in highly competitive environments. We have a large concentration of properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia areas. We compete with a large number of property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and re
novation costs, taxes, governmental regulation, legislation and population trends.

We depend on leasing space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from tenants who may not be able to pay.

Our financial results depend significantly on leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms. In addition, because a substantial majority of our income comes from renting of real property, our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and funds available for distribution to shareholders will decrease if a significant number of our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain occupancy levels on favorable terms. If a tenant does not pay its rent, we may not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs.  During periods of economic adversity such as we are currently experiencing, there may be an increase in the number of tenants that cannot pay their rent and an increase in vacancy rates.

Bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenues and available cash.

From time to time, some of our tenants have declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the future. In the case of our shopping centers, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could cause us to suffer lower revenues and operational difficulties, including leasing the remainder of the property. As a result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could result in a lower level of net income and funds available for the payment of indebtedness or for distribution to shareholders.  The current economic environment and market conditions may result in tenant bankruptcies and write-offs, which could, in the aggregate, be material to our results of operations in a particular period.

We may incur costs to comply with environmental laws.

Our operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may impair our ability to s
ell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and underground storage tanks are also regulated by federal and state laws. We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or tanks or related claims ar
ising out of environmental contamination or human exposure to contamination at or from our properties.

Each of our properties has been subject to varying degrees of environmental assessment. The environmental assessments did not, as of this date, reveal any environmental condition material to our business. However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, discovery of additional sites, human exposure to the contamination or changes in clean-up or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us.


Inflation or deflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Although neither inflation nor deflation has materially impacted our operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a pronounced negative impact on our mortgages and interest rates and general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents.  Inflation could also have an adverse effect on consumer spending which could impact our tenants’ sales and, in turn, our percentage rents, where applicable.  Conversely, deflation could lead to downward pressure on rents and other sources of income.  In addition, we own 9 residential properties which are leased to tenants with one-year lease terms.  Because these are short-term leases, declines in market rents will impact our residential properties faster than if the leases were for longer terms.

Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.

We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, including coverage for terrorist acts, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods.  Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $150,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, and a $150,000,000 annual aggregate.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by TRIPRA.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC.  Our coverage for NBCR losses is up to $2 billion per occurrence, for which PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and 15% of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of a covered loss.  We are ultimately responsible for any loss borne by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements, contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance and/or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Because we operate a hotel, we face the risks associated with the hospitality industry.

We own and operate the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City. The following factors, among others, are common to the hotel industry and may reduce the revenues generated by the hotel, which would reduce cash available for distribution to our shareholders:

·

our hotel competes for guests with other hotels, a number of which have greater marketing and financial resources;

·

if there is an increase in operating costs resulting from inflation and other factors, we may not be able to offset such increase by increasing room rates;

·

our hotel is subject to the fluctuating and seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism;

·

our hotel is subject to general and local economic and social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, including war and terrorism; and

·

physical condition, which may require substantial additional capital.

Because of the ownership structure of the Hotel Pennsylvania, we face potential adverse effects from changes to the applicable tax laws.

Under the Internal Revenue Code, REITs like us are not allowed to operate hotels directly or indirectly. Accordingly, we lease the Hotel Pennsylvania to our taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”). While the TRS structure allows the economic benefits of ownership to flow to us, the TRS is subject to tax on its income from the operations of the hotel at the federal and state level. In addition, the TRS is subject to detailed tax regulations that affect how it may be capitalized and operated. If the tax laws applicable to a TRS are modified, we may be forced to modify the structure for owning the hotel, and such changes may adversely affect the cash flows from the hotel. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, and we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new fede
ral tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any of such actions may prospectively or retroactively modify the tax treatment of the TRS and, therefore, may adversely affect our after-tax returns from the hotel.


Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.

The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. From time to time persons have asserted claims against us with respect to some of our properties under this Act, but to date such claims have not resulted in any material expense or liability. If, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders.

Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.

Our Investments Are Concentrated in the New York CITY METROPOLITAN AREA and Washington, DC / NORTHERN VIRGINIA Areas. Circumstances Affecting These Areas Generally Could Adversely Affect Our Business.

A significant portion of our properties are in the New York City / New Jersey metropolitan areas and Washington, DC / Northern Virginia areas are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent to those areas.

During 2009, approximately 75% of our EBITDA, excluding items that affect comparability, came from properties located in the New York City / New Jersey metropolitan areas and the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia areas. We may continue to concentrate a significant portion of our future acquisitions in these areas or in other geographic real estate markets in the United States or abroad. Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns, as they are currently and have been in the past, and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact these markets in both the short and long term. Declines in the economy or a decline in the real estate markets in these areas could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties. The factors affecting economic conditions in these regions include:

·

financial performance and productivity of the publishing, advertising, financial, technology, retail, insurance and

real estate industries;

·

space needs of the United States Government, including the effect of base closures and repositioning under the

Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 2005, as amended;

·

business layoffs or downsizing;

·

industry slowdowns;

·

relocations of businesses;

·

changing demographics;

·

increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places;

·

infrastructure quality; and

any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.

It is impossible for us to assess with certainty, the future effects of the current adverse trends in the economic and investment climates of the geographic areas in which we concentrate, and more generally of the United States, or the real estate markets in these areas. If these conditions persist or if there is any further local, national or global economic downturn, our businesses and future profitability will be adversely affected.

Terrorist attacks, such as those of September 11, 2001 in New York City and the Washington, DC area, may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.

We have significant investments in large metropolitan areas, including the New York, Washington, DC, Chicago, Boston and San Francisco metropolitan areas. In the aftermath of a terrorist attack, tenants in these areas may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in these areas. This, in turn, would trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these areas, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease space on less favorable terms. As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues and cash flows could decline materially.


We May Acquire or Sell Additional Assets or Entities or Develop Additional Properties. Our Failure or Inability to Consummate These Transactions or Manage the Results of These Transactions Could Adversely Affect Our Operations and Financial Results.

We have grown rapidly since 1998 through acquisitions. We may not be able to maintain this rapid growth and our failure to do so could adversely affect our stock price.

We have experienced rapid growth since 1998, increasing our total assets from approximately $4.4 billion at December 31, 1998 to approximately $20.2 billion at December 31, 2009. We may not be able to maintain a similar rate of growth in the future or manage growth effectively. Our failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and ability to pay dividends to shareholders.

We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks.

We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies. We may not, however, succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. In addition, we may face competition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. When we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover our costs of acquisition and development or in operating the businesses we acquired.  Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management’s attention. Acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowl
edge may result in poorer than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated. Furthermore, acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware at the time of acquisition. In addition, development of our existing properties presents similar risks.

From time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, one or more material acquisitions.  The announcement of such a material acquisition may result in a rapid and significant decline in the price of our common shares.

We are continuously looking at material transactions that we will believe will maximize shareholder value.  However, an announcement by us of one or more significant acquisitions could result in a quick and significant decline in the price of our common shares and convertible and exchangeable securities.

It may be difficult to buy and sell real estate quickly.

Real estate investments are relatively difficult to buy and sell quickly. Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.

We may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the debt associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs.

As part of an acquisition of a property, including our January 1, 2002 acquisition of Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P.’s 13.0 million square foot portfolio, we may agree, and in the case of Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P. did agree, with the seller that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on them for a period of 12 years, unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the seller. These agreements could result in us holding on to properties that we would otherwise sell and not pay down or refinance indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance.

On January 1, 2002, we completed the acquisition of the 66% interest in Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P. that we did not previously own. The terms of the merger restrict our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of, or to finance or refinance, the properties formerly owned by Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P., which could result in our inability to sell these properties at an opportune time and increase costs to us.

As indicated above, subject to limited exceptions, we are restricted from selling or otherwise transferring or disposing of certain properties located in the Crystal City area of Arlington, Virginia for a period of 12 years. These restrictions, which currently cover approximately 13.0 million square feet of space, could result in our inability to sell these properties at an opportune time and increase costs to us.


From time to time we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control. Some of these companies operate in industries that differ from our current operations, with different risks than investing in real estate.

From time to time we make debt or equity investments in other companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control. These investments include but are not limited to,  Alexander’s, Inc., Toys “R” Us, Lexington Realty Trust, and equity and mezzanine investments in other entities that have significant real estate assets. Although these businesses generally have a significant real estate component, some of them operate in businesses that are different from our primary lines of business including, without limitation, operating or managing toy stores and department stores. Consequently, investments in these businesses, among other risks, subjects us to the operating and financial risks of industries other than real estate and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses. From time to time we 
may make additional investments in or acquire other entities that may subject us to additional similar risks. Investments in entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures, present additional risks such as having differing objectives than our partners or the entities in which we invest, or becoming involved in disputes, or competing with those persons. In addition, we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to comply with applicable standards may adversely affect us.

We are subject to risks that affect the general retail environment.

A substantial portion of our properties are in the retail shopping center real estate market and we have a significant investment in retailers such as Toys. See “

Our investment in Toys subjects us to risks different from our other lines of business and may result in increased seasonality and volatility in our reported earnings

” below. This means that we are subject to factors that affect the retail environment generally, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, the threat of terrorism and increasing competition from discount retailers, outlet malls, retail websites and catalog companies. These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants and the retailers in whi
ch we hold an investment and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers, and in turn, adversely affect us.

We depend upon our anchor tenants to attract shoppers.

We own several regional malls and other shopping centers that are typically anchored by well-known department stores and other tenants who generate shopping traffic at the mall or shopping center. The value of our properties would be adversely affected if tenants or anchors failed to meet their contractual obligations, sought concessions in order to continue operations or ceased their operations, including as a result of bankruptcy. If the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to economic conditions, closing of anchors or for other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the event of a default by a tenant or anchor, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord.

Our investment in Toys subjects us to risks that are different from our other lines of business and may result in increased seasonality and volatility in our reported earnings.

On July 21, 2005, a joint venture that we own equally with Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. acquired Toys. Because Toys is a retailer, its operations subject us to the risks of a retail company that are different than those presented by our other lines of business. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. In addition, our fiscal year ends on December 31 whereas, as is common for retailers, Toys’ fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. Therefore, we record our pro-rata share of Toys’ net earnings on a one-quarter lag basis. For example, our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2009 include Toys’ financial results for its first, second and third quarters ended October 31, 2009, as well as 
Toys’ fourth quarter results of 2008. Because of the seasonality of Toys, our reported net income shows increased volatility. We may also, in the future and from time to time, invest in other businesses that may report financial results that are more volatile than our historical financial results.

Our decision to dispose of real estate assets would change the holding period assumption in our valuation analyses, which could result in material impairment losses and adversely affect our financial results.

We evaluate real estate assets for impairment based on the projected cash flow of the asset over our anticipated holding period.  If we change our intended holding period, due to our intention to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset, then under generally accepted accounting principles we must reevaluate whether that asset is impaired.  Depending on the carrying value of the property at the time we change our intention and the amount that we estimate we would receive on disposal, we may record an impairment loss that would adversely affect our financial results. This loss could be material to our results of operations in the period that it is recognized.


We invest in subordinated or mezzanine debt of certain entities that have significant real estate assets.  These investments involve greater risk of loss than investments in senior mortgage loans.

We invest, and may in the future invest, in subordinated or mezzanine debt of certain entities that have significant real estate assets.  These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate.  These investments involve greater risk of loss than investments in senior mortgage loans which are secured by real property.  If a borrower defaults on debt to us or on debt senior to us, or declares bankruptcy, we may not be able to recover some or all of our investment.  In addition, there may be significant delays and costs associated with the process of foreclosing on collateral securing or supporting these investments.  The value of the assets securing or supporting our investments could deteriorate over time d
ue to factors beyond our control, including acts or omissions by owners, changes in business, economic or market conditions, or foreclosure.  Such deteriorations in value may result in the recognition of impairment losses and/or valuation allowances on our statements of income.  As of December 31, 2009, our mezzanine debt securities have an aggregate carrying amount of $203,286,000, net of a $190,738,000 valuation allowance.

We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans each quarter, if circumstances warrant, in determining whether they are impaired. A loan is impaired when based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the estimated fair value of the loan or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if repayment of the loan is collateral dependent.  There can be no assurance that our estimates of collectible amounts will not change over time or that they will be representative of the amounts we will actually collect, including amounts we would collect if we chose to sell these investments before their maturity.&n
bsp; If we collect less than our estimates, we will record impairment losses which could be material.

We invest in marketable equity securities of companies that have significant real estate assets.  The value of these investments may decline as a result of operating performance or economic or market conditions.

We invest, and may in the future invest, in marketable equity securities of publicly-traded real estate companies or companies that have significant real estate assets.  As of December 31, 2009, our marketable securities have an aggregate carrying amount of $380,652,000.  Significant declines in the value of these investments due to operating performance or economic or market conditions may result in the recognition of impairment losses which could be material.

Our Organizational and Financial Structure Gives Rise to Operational and Financial Risks.

We May Not Be Able to Obtain Capital to Make Investments.

We depend primarily on external financing to fund the growth of our business. This is because one of the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for a REIT is that it distributes 90% of its net taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its shareholders. There is a separate requirement to distribute net capital gains or pay a corporate level tax in lieu thereof. Our access to debt or equity financing depends on the willingness of third parties to lend or make equity investments and on conditions in the capital markets generally. As a result of the current capital markets and environmental conditions referred to above, we and other companies in the real estate industry are currently experiencing limited availability of financing and there can be no assurances as to when more financing will be available.  Although we believe that we will be ab
le to finance any investments we may wish to make in the foreseeable future, new financing may not be available on acceptable terms.

For information about our available sources of funds, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


Vornado Realty Trust depends on dividends and distributions from its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The creditors and preferred security holders of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to Vornado Realty Trust.

Substantially all of Vornado Realty Trust’s assets are held through its Operating Partnership that holds substantially all of its properties and assets through subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership’s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by its subsidiaries, and in turn, substantially all of Vornado Realty Trust’s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by the Operating Partnership. The creditors of each of Vornado Realty Trust’s direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations to them, when due and payable, before distributions may be made by that subsidiary to its equity holders. Thus, the Operating Partnership’s ability to make distributions to holders of its units depends on its subsidiaries’ ability first to satisfy their obligations to their creditors and then to make
 distributions to the Operating Partnership. Likewise, Vornado Realty Trust’s ability to pay dividends to holders of common and preferred shares depends on the Operating Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions payable to holders of preferred units and then to make distributions to Vornado Realty Trust.

Furthermore, the holders of preferred units of the Operating Partnership are entitled to receive preferred distributions before payment of distributions to holders of Class A units of the Operating Partnership, including Vornado Realty Trust. Thus, Vornado Realty Trust’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders and satisfy its debt obligations depends on the Operating Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions to holders of its preferred units and then to holders of its Class A units, including Vornado Realty Trust. As of December 31, 2009, there were seven series of preferred units of the Operating Partnership not held by Vornado Realty Trust with a total liquidation value of $340,078,000.

In addition, Vornado Realty Trust’s participation in any distribution of the assets of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency, is only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors and preferred security holders, are satisfied.

We have outstanding debt, and it and its cost may increase and refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $14.1 billion of total debt outstanding, including our pro rata share of debt of partially owned entities. Our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value was approximately 47%. When we say “enterprise value” in the preceding sentence, we mean market equity value of Vornado Realty Trust’s common and preferred shares plus total debt outstanding, including our pro rata share of debt of partially owned entities. In the future, we may incur additional debt to finance acquisitions or property developments and thus increase our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value. If our level of indebtedness increases, there may be an increased risk of a credit rating downgrade or a default on our obligations that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in a rising interest rat
e environment, the cost of existing variable rate debt and any new debt or other market rate security or instrument may increase.  Furthermore, we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms.

Covenants in our debt instruments could adversely affect our financial condition and our acquisitions and development activities.

The mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage. Our unsecured credit facilities, unsecured debt securities and other loans that we may obtain in the future contain, or may contain, customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including covenants that limit our ability to incur debt based upon the level of our ratio of total debt to total assets, our ratio of secured debt to total assets, our ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, and fixed charges, and that require us to maintain a certain level of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt. Our ability to borrow is subject to compliance with these and other covenants. In addition, failure to comply with our c
ovenants could cause a default under the applicable debt instrument, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or may be available only on unattractive terms.

We rely on debt financing, including borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities, issuances of unsecured debt securities and debt secured by individual properties, to finance acquisitions and development activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt financing from these or other sources, or refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected. If we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders can declare a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of the property securing the defaulted loan.


Vornado Realty Trust may fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT and may be required to pay income taxes at corporate rates.

Although we believe that we will remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may fail to remain qualified in this way. Qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. Our qualification as a REIT also depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to the requirements for qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT.

If, with respect to any taxable year, we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions, we could not deduct distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The federal income tax payable would include any applicable alternative minimum tax. If we had to pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute to shareholders and pay our indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved, and we would no longer be required to make distributions to shareholders. In addition, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost, unless we were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions. Although we curre
ntly intend to operate in a manner designed to allow us to qualify as a REIT, future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause us to revoke the REIT election or fail to qualify as a REIT.

We face possible adverse changes in tax laws, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.

From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. The shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for payment of dividends.

Loss of our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common shares.

We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Vornado Realty Trust, and Michael D. Fascitelli, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado Realty Trust. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common shares.

Vornado Realty Trust’s charter documents and applicable law may hinder any attempt to acquire us.

Our Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust sets limits on the ownership of our shares.

Generally, for Vornado Realty Trust to maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% in value of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of Vornado Realty Trust may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of Vornado Realty Trust’s taxable year. The Internal Revenue Code defines “individuals” for purposes of the requirement described in the preceding sentence to include some types of entities. Under Vornado Realty Trust’s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as amended, no person may own more than 6.7% of the outstanding common shares of any class, or 9.9% of the outstanding preferred shares of any class, with some exceptions for persons who held common shares in excess of the 6.7% limit before Vornado Realty Trust adopted the limit and other pers
ons approved by Vornado Realty Trust’s Board of Trustees. These restrictions on transferability and ownership may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado Realty Trust or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the shareholders. We refer to Vornado Realty Trust’s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as amended, as the “declaration of trust.”

We have a classified Board of Trustees and that may reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Vornado Realty Trust’s Board of Trustees is divided into three classes of trustees. Trustees of each class are chosen for three-year staggered terms. Staggered terms of trustees may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of Vornado Realty Trust, even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of Vornado Realty Trust’s shareholders.


We may issue additional shares in a manner that could adversely affect the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Vornado Realty Trust’s declaration of trust authorizes the Board of Trustees to:

·

cause Vornado Realty Trust to issue additional authorized but unissued common shares or preferred shares;

·

classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred shares;

·

set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified shares that Vornado Realty Trust issues; and

·

increase, without shareholder approval, the number of shares of beneficial interest that Vornado Realty Trust may issue.

The Board of Trustees could establish a series of preferred shares whose terms could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado Realty Trust or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of Vornado Realty Trust’s shareholders, although the Board of Trustees does not now intend to establish a series of preferred shares of this kind. Vornado Realty Trust’s declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado Realty Trust or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders.

The Maryland General Corporation Law contains provisions that may reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, as amended, which we refer to as the “MGCL,” as applicable to REITs, certain “business combinations,” including certain mergers, consolidations, share exchanges and asset transfers and certain issuances and reclassifications of equity securities, between a Maryland REIT and any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the trust’s shares or an affiliate or an associate, as defined in the MGCL, of the trust who, at any time within the two-year period before the date in question, was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting shares of beneficial interest of the trust, which we refer to as an “interested shareholder,” or an affiliate of the interested shareholder, are prohibited for five years after the most recent da
te on which the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder. After that five-year period, any business combination of these kinds must be recommended by the board of trustees of the trust and approved by the affirmative vote of at least (a) 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares of beneficial interest of the trust and (b) two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting shares of beneficial interest of the trust other than shares held by the interested shareholder with whom, or with whose affiliate, the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested shareholder.  These supermajority voting requirements do not apply if the trust’s common shareholders receive a minimum price, as defined in the MGCL, for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares.

The provisions of the MGCL do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of trustees of the applicable trust before the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, and a person is not an interested shareholder if the board of trustees approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested shareholder.

In approving a transaction, the Board may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the Board.  Vornado Realty Trust’s Board has adopted a resolution exempting any business combination between any trustee or officer of Vornado Realty Trust, or their affiliates, and Vornado Realty Trust. As a result, the trustees and officers of Vornado Realty Trust and their affiliates may be able to enter into business combinations with Vornado Realty Trust that may not be in the best interest of its shareholders. With respect to business combinations with other persons, the business combination provisions of the MGCL may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Vornado Realty Trust or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in th
e best interest of the shareholders. The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of Vornado Realty Trust and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.

We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our shareholders.

Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other companies, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Trustees. Accordingly, our shareholders do not control these policies.


Our Ownership Structure and Related-Party Transactions May Give Rise to Conflicts of Interest.

Steven Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of our other trustees and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.

As of December 31, 2009, Interstate Properties, a New Jersey general partnership, and its partners owned approximately 7.3% of the common shares of Vornado Realty Trust and approximately 27.2% of the common stock of Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”), which is described below.  Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the three partners of Interstate Properties. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board of Vornado Realty Trust, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties and the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s. Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are trustees of Vornado Realty Trust and also directors of Alexander’s.

Because of these overlapping interests, Mr. Roth and Interstate Properties and its partners may have substantial influence over Vornado Realty Trust and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Vornado Realty Trust shareholders for approval. In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate Properties and our other equity or debt holders. In addition, Mr. Roth, Interstate Properties and its partners, and Alexander’s currently and may in the future engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as which of these entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these entities,
 the types of properties and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these entities.

Vornado Realty Trust currently manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate Properties under a management agreement for which it receives an annual fee equal to 4% of base rent and percentage rent and certain other commissions. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term. Vornado Realty Trust earned $782,000, $803,000, and $800,000 of management fees under the management agreement for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Because of the relationship among Vornado Realty Trust, Interstate Properties and Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight, as described above, the terms of the management agreement and any future agreements between Vornado Realty Trust and Interstate Properties may not be comparable to those Vornado Realty Trus
t could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.

There may be conflicts of interest between Alexander’s and us.

As of December 31, 2009, the Operating Partnership owned 32.4% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s. Alexander’s is a REIT engaged in leasing, managing, developing and redeveloping properties, focusing primarily on the locations where its department stores operated before they ceased operations in 1992. Alexander’s has seven properties, which are located in the greater New York metropolitan area.  In addition to the 32.4% that they own indirectly through Vornado, Interstate Properties, which is described above, and its partners owned 27.2% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s as of December 31, 2009. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board of Vornado Realty Trust, the managing general partner of Interstate, and the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s.  Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum ar
e trustees of Vornado Realty Trust and also directors of Alexander’s and general partners of Interstate.  Michael D. Fascitelli is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado Realty Trust and the President of Alexander’s and Dr. Richard West is a trustee of Vornado and a director of Alexander’s.  In addition, Joseph Macnow, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, holds the same position with Alexander’s.  Alexander’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “ALX.”

The Operating Partnership manages, develops and leases the Alexander’s properties under management and development agreements and leasing agreements under which the Operating Partnership receives annual fees from Alexander’s. These agreements have a one-year term expiring in March of each year and are all automatically renewable. Because Vornado Realty Trust and Alexander’s share common senior management and because certain of the trustees of Vornado Realty Trust constitute a majority of the directors of Alexander’s, the terms of the foregoing agreements and any future agreements between us and Alexander’s may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.

For a description of Interstate Properties’ ownership of Vornado Realty Trust and Alexander’s, see “Steven Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of our other trustees and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us” above.


The Number of Shares of Vornado Realty Trust and the Market for Those Shares Give Rise to Various Risks.

The trading price of our common shares has recently been volatile and may fluctuate.

The trading price of our common shares has recently been volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control.  In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies.  These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common shares.  Among the factors that could affect the price of our common shares are:

·

actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;

·

the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in

comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and fixed

income securities;

·

continued uncertainty and volatility in the equity and credit markets;

·

changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial

analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other real estate investment

trusts;

·

failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;

·

speculation in the press or investment community;

·

strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;

·

the extent of institutional interest in us;

·

the extent of short-selling of our common shares and the shares of our competitors;

·

fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;

·

general financial and economic market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions

for real estate investment trusts and other real estate related companies; and

·

domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance.

A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for shareholders.

Vornado Realty Trust has many shares available for future sale, which could hurt the market price of its shares.

As of December 31, 2009, we had authorized but unissued, 68,785,839 common shares of beneficial interest, $.04 par value and 76,047,676 preferred shares of beneficial interest, no par value; of which 34,058,475 common shares are reserved for issuance upon redemption of Class A Operating Partnership units, convertible securities and employee stock options and 8,000,000 preferred shares are reserved for issuance upon redemption of preferred Operating Partnership units.  Any shares not reserved may be issued from time to time in public or private offerings or in connection with acquisitions.  In addition, common and preferred shares reserved may be sold upon issuance in the public market after registration under the Securities Act or under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or other available exemptions from registration.  We cannot predict the effect that f
uture sales of our common and preferred shares or Operating Partnership Class A and preferred units will have on the market prices of our outstanding shares.

Increased market interest rates may hurt the value of Vornado Realty Trust’s common and preferred shares.

We believe that investors consider the distribution rate on REIT shares, expressed as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates as an important factor in deciding whether to buy or sell the shares. If market interest rates go up, prospective purchasers of REIT shares may expect a higher distribution rate. Higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and might decrease funds available for distribution. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of Vornado Realty Trust’s common and preferred shares to decline.

New York Office Properties lease terms generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 15 years for major tenants, and may provide for extension options at market rates. Leases typically provide for periodic step‑ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants their share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year. Electricity is provided to tenants on a sub-metered basis or included in rent based on surveys and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases. Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.

Washington, DC Office Properties lease terms generally range from five to seven years, and may provide for extension options at either pre-negotiated or market rates. Leases typically provide for periodic step-ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants, the tenants’ share of increases in real estate taxes and certain property operating expenses over a base year. Periodic step-ups in rent are usually based upon either fixed percentage increases or the consumer price index. Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.

RETAIL PROPERTIES

As of December 31, 2009, we own 162 retail properties, of which 132 are strip shopping centers located primarily in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and California; 7 are regional malls located in New York, New Jersey, Virginia and San Juan, Puerto Rico; and 23 are retail properties located in Manhattan (“Manhattan Street Retail”).  Our strip shopping centers and malls are generally located on major highways in mature, densely populated areas, and therefore attract consumers from a regional, rather than a neighborhood market place.

Strip Shopping Centers

Our strip shopping centers contain an aggregate of 16.1 million square feet and are substantially (over 80%) leased to large stores (over 20,000 square feet). Tenants include destination retailers such as discount department stores, supermarkets, home improvement stores, discount apparel stores and membership warehouse clubs. Tenants typically offer basic consumer necessities such as food, health and beauty aids, moderately priced clothing, building materials and home improvement supplies, and compete primarily on the basis of price and location.

Regional Malls

The Green Acres Mall in Valley Stream, Long Island, New York contains 1.8 million square feet, and is anchored by Macy’s, Sears, Wal-Mart, J.C. Penney, Best Buy and a BJ’s Wholesale Club.

The Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, New Jersey, in which we own a 50% interest, contains 1.5 million square feet and is anchored by Macy’s, Lord & Taylor and J.C. Penney, two of which own their stores aggregating 457,000 square feet.

The Springfield Mall in Springfield, Virginia, contains 1.4 million square feet and is anchored by Macy’s, J.C. Penney and Target who own their stores aggregating 390,000 square feet.  We continue to evaluate plans to renovate and reposition the mall; given current economic conditions, that may require us to renegotiate the terms of the existing debt and, accordingly, we have requested that the debt be placed with the special servicer.

The Bergen Town Center in Paramus, New Jersey contains 950,000 square feet and is anchored by Century 21, Whole Foods and Target under leases aggregating 416,000 square feet.  We are currently developing 250,000 square feet of retail space adjacent to the mall which will be anchored by Lowe’s Home Improvement.  This development is expected to be completed in 2010.

The Broadway Mall in Hicksville, Long Island, New York contains 1.1 million square feet and is anchored by Macy’s, Ikea, Multiplex Cinema and Target, which owns its store containing 141,000 square feet.

The Montehiedra Mall in San Juan, Puerto Rico contains 540,000 square feet and is anchored by Home Depot, Kmart, and Marshalls.

The Las Catalinas Mall in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contains 495,000 square feet and is anchored by Kmart and Sears, which owns its 139,000 square foot store.

Manhattan Street Retail

Manhattan Street Retail is comprised of 23 properties containing 1,048,000 square feet.  These properties include (i) properties in the Penn Plaza district, such as the Manhattan Mall which contains 242,000 square feet, anchored by JC Penney; (ii) 4 Union Square which contains 203,000 square feet, anchored by Whole Foods Market, Filenes Basement and DSW; (iii) 1540 Broadway in Times Square which contains 161,000 square feet, anchored by Forever 21 and Disney, which will open their flagship stores in 2010, and Planet Hollywood; and (iv) properties on Madison Avenue and in So-Ho occupied by retailers including H&M, Top Shop, Madewell, the GAP, Gucci, Chloe and Cartier.  In addition, we own 817,000 square feet of retail space in certain of our New York office buildings, which is part of our New York Office Properties segment.

Retail Properties lease terms generally range from five years or less in some instances for smaller tenants to as long as 25 years for major tenants.  Leases generally provide for reimbursements of real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges (including roof and structure in strip shopping centers, unless it is the tenant’s direct responsibility), and percentage rents based on tenant sales volume.

Office lease terms generally range from three to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 15 years for major tenants. Leases typically provide for periodic step-ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants their share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year. Electricity is provided to tenants on a sub-metered basis or included in rent and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases. Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction of its premises.

Item 3.          Legal Proceedings

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including the matters referred to below, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (“USDC-NJ”) claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that a prior order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York dated February 6, 2001, as modified on appeal to the District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 13, 2001, froze our right to reallocate which effectively terminated our right to collect the additional rent from Stop & Shop. On March 3, 2003, 
after we moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Stop & Shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint. On March 26, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a new complaint in New York State Supreme Court, asserting substantially the same claims as in its USDC-NJ complaint. We removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In January 2005 that court remanded the action to the New York State Supreme Court. On February 14, 2005, we served an answer in which we asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the mo
tions for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Court’s decision and on December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Court’s decision.  On January 16, 2007, we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Court’s decision which was denied on March 13, 2007.  Discovery is now complete.  On October 19, 2009, Stop & Shop filed a motion for leave to amend its pleadings to assert new claims for relief, including a claim for damages in an unspecified amount, and an additional affirmative defense.  The motion was argued and submitted for decision on December 18, 2009.  The course of future proceedings will depend upon the outcome of Stop & Shop’s motion, but we anticipate that a trial date will be set for some time in 2010.  We intend to vigorously pursue our claims against Stop & Shop.  In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a
 material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

On May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas and the 555 California Street complex.  Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties.  The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump.  In August 2005, Mr. Trump brought a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court against, among others, the general partners of the partnerships referred to above relating to a dispute over the sale of properties located on the former Penn Central rail yards between West 59th and 72nd Streets in Manhattan which were formerly owned by the partnerships.  In decisions iss
ued in 2006, 2007 and 2009, the New York State Supreme Court dismissed all of Mr. Trump’s claims, and those decisions were affirmed by the Appellate Division.  Mr. Trump cannot further appeal those decisions.

In July 2005, we acquired H Street Building Corporation (“H Street”) which has a subsidiary that owns, among other things, a 50% tenancy in common interest in land located in Arlington County, Virginia, known as "Pentagon Row," leased to two tenants.  In April 2007, H Street acquired the remaining 50% interest in that fee.  In April 2007, we received letters from those tenants, Street Retail, Inc. and Post Apartment Homes, L.P., claiming they had a right of first offer triggered by each of those transactions. On September 25, 2008, both tenants filed suit against us and the former owners.  The claim alleges the right to purchase the fee interest, damages in excess of $75,000,000 and punitive damages.  We believe this claim is without merit and regardless of merit, in our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, this c
laim will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities

During the fourth quarter of 2009, we issued 35,719 common shares upon the redemption of Class A units of the Operating Partnership held by persons who received units, in private placements in earlier periods, in exchange for their interests in limited partnerships that owned real estate. The common shares were issued without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance on Section 4 (2) of that Act.

Information relating to compensation plans under which our equity securities are authorized for issuance is set forth under Part III, Item 12 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and such information is incorporated by reference herein.

Recent Purchases of Equity Securities

Performance Graph

The following graph is a comparison of the five-year cumulative return of our common shares, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (the “S&P 500 Index”) and the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts’ (“NAREIT”) All Equity Index (excluding health care real estate investment trusts), a peer group index.  The graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2004 in our common shares, the S&P 500 Index and the NAREIT All Equity Index and that all dividends were reinvested without the payment of any commissions.  There can be no assurance that the performance of our shares will continue in line with the same or similar trends depicted in the graph below.

________________________________

(1)     FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”).  NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets and GAAP extraordinary items, and to include depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains o
n sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions.  FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flows as a liquidity measure.  FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Overview

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 92.5% of the common limited partnership interest in, the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2009. All references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership.

We own and operate office, retail and showroom properties (our “core” operations) with large concentrations of office and retail properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia areas. In addition, we have a 32.7% interest in Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”) which has a significant real estate component, a 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc., which has seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, as well as interests in other real estate and related investments.

On May 14, 2009, our Board of Trustees executed its long-planned management succession strategy and elected Michael D. Fascitelli, as our Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Steven Roth, who continues to serve as Chairman of the Board.

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. Below is a table comparing our performance to that of the Morgan Stanley REIT Index (“RMS”) and the SNL REIT Index (“SNL”) for the following periods ending December 31, 2009 (past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance):

______________________

(1)

Past performance is not necessarily indicative of how we will perform in the future.

We intend to achieve our business objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through:

·

Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

·

Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there

is high likelihood of capital appreciation;

·

Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

·

Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;

·

Investing in fully-integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate component; and

·

Developing and redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets.

We may also determine to raise capital for future real estate acquisitions through an institutional investment fund.  We would serve as the general partner of the fund and would also expect to be a limited partner of the fund and have the potential to earn certain incentives based on the fund’s performance.  The fund may serve as our exclusive investment vehicle for a limited period of time for all investments that fit within the fund’s investment parameters.  If we determine to raise capital through a fund, the partnership interests offered would not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and could not be offered or sold in the United State s absent registration under that act or an applicable exemption from those registration requirements.


Overview - continued

We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.  See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.

The economic recession and illiquidity and volatility in the financial and capital markets have negatively affected substantially all businesses, including ours.  Demand for office and retail space has declined nationwide due to bankruptcies, downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting.  Real estate transactions and development opportunities have significantly curtailed and capitalization rates have risen.  These trends have negatively impacted our 2008 and 2009 financial results, which include losses associated with abandoned development projects, valuation allowances on investments in mezzanine loans and impairments on other real estate investments.  The details of these non-cash charges are described below. Impairment losses and valuation allowances are based on our estimates of the amounts we may ultimately realize upon disposition.  The estimation pro
cess is inherently uncertain and is based upon, among other factors, our expectations of future events, and accordingly, actual amounts received on these investments could differ materially from our estimates. It is not possible for us to quantify the impact of the above trends, which may continue in 2010 and beyond, on our future financial results.

Quarter Ended December 31, 2009 Financial Results Summary

Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 was $151,192,000, or $0.84 per diluted share, versus $226,951,000, or $1.47 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2008.  Net loss for the quarters ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 include $2,632,000 and $1,083,000, respectively, of net gains on sale of real estate.  In addition, net loss for the quarters ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 include certain other items that affect comparability which are listed in the table below.  The aggregate of net gains on sale of real estate and the items in the table below, net of amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, increased net loss attributable to common shareholders for the quarters ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 by $184,330,000 and $251,841,000, or $1.03 and $1.63 per diluted sh
are, respectively.

FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 was $20,000, or $0.00 per diluted share, compared to negative FFO of $88,154,000, or $0.57 per diluted share, for the prior year’s quarter.  FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 and negative FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 include certain items that affect comparability which are listed in the table below. The aggregate of these items, net of amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, decreased FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 by $189,455,000, or $1.04 per diluted share and increased negative FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 by $253,506,000, or $1.64 per diluted share.

Financings

In April 2009, we sold 17,250,000 common shares, including underwriters’ over-allotment, in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement at an initial public offering price of $43.00 per share.  We received net proceeds of $710,226,000, after underwriters’ discount and offering expenses and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 17,250,000 Class A units of the Operating Partnership.

On September 30, 2009, we completed a public offering of $460,000,000 principal amount of 7.875% callable senior unsecured 30-year notes (NYSE: VNOD) due October 1, 2039.  The notes were sold to the public at par and may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, beginning in October 2014 at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

These notes contain financial covenants, including limitations on outstanding debt and minimum interest and fixed charge coverage ratios.  We received net proceeds of approximately $446,000,000 from the offering which were used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes.

During 2009, we purchased $1,912,724,000 (aggregate face amount) of our convertible senior debentures and $352,740,000 (aggregate face amount) of our senior unsecured notes for $1,877,510,000 and $343,694,000 in cash, respectively.  This debt was acquired through tender offers and in the open market and has been retired.   We also repaid $650,285,000 of existing property level debt and completed $277,000,000 of property level financings.  In connection with the above, we recognized an aggregate net loss of $25,915,000 from the early extinguishment of debt on our consolidated statement of income.

Dispositions

On September 1, 2009, we sold 1999 K Street, a newly developed 250,000 square foot office building, in Washington’s Central Business District, for $207,800,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $41,211,000, which is included as a component of “income from discontinued operations,” on our consolidated statement of income.

During 2009, we sold 15 retail properties in separate transactions for an aggregate of $55,000,000 in cash, which resulted in net gains aggregating $4,073,000, which is included as a component of “income from discontinued operations,” on our consolidated statement of income.

Mezzanine Loans Receivable

On June 1, 2009, we were repaid the entire $41,758,000 balance of the Charles Square Hotel loan including accrued interest.  This loan was scheduled to mature in September 2009.

On January 28, 2010, we were repaid the entire $99,314,000 balance of the Equinox loan including accrued interest.  This loan, which we acquired in 2006 for $57,500,000, was scheduled to mature in February 2013.

Impact of Retrospective Application of New Accounting Pronouncements

During 2009, we paid quarterly dividends to our common shareholders in a combination of cash and stock and retrospectively adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding in the computations of income and FFO per share to include the additional common shares resulting from these dividends in the earliest periods presented in each of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2009, June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009 and our Current Report on Form 8-K, issued on October 13, 2009, in which we elected to recast our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A (Amendment No. 1) for the year ended December 31, 2008.  On December 2, 2009, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in EITF 09-E,

Accounting for Distribution to Shareholders with Componen
ts of Stock and Cash (“EITF 09-E”)

as codified through Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2010-1 to ASC 505,

Equity.

EITF 09-E requires an entity to include the additional common shares resulting from the stock portion of these distributions prospectively in the periods following their issuance in all computations of income per share rather than retrospectively as we had previously done.  As a result, we have adjusted all of our computations of income and FFO per share presented herein to exclude the additional shares resulting from these dividends in periods prior to their issuance.  Below is a reconciliation of previously reported income and FFO per share to the amounts presented herein.

Overview - continued

On January 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of ASC 470-20,

Debt with Conversion and Other Options

, which was required to be applied retrospectively.

The adoption affected the accounting for our convertible

and exchangeable senior debentures by requiring

the initial proceeds from their sale to be allocated between a debt component and an equity component

in a manner that results in interest expense on the debt component at our nonconvertible 
debt borrowing rate on the date of issue.  The initial debt components of our $1.4 billion Convertible Senior Debentures, $1 billion Convertible Senior Debentures and $500 million Exchangeable Senior Debentures were $1,241,286,000, $926,361,000 and $457,699,000, respectively, based on the fair value of similar nonconvertible instruments issued at that time.  The aggregate initial debt discount of $216,655,000 after original issuance costs allocated to the equity component was recorded in “additional capital” in our consolidated statement of changes in equity.  The discount is amortized using the effective interest method over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding (i.e., the earliest date the holders may require us to repurchase the debentures), which resulted in $39,546,000 and $30,418,000 of additional interest expense in the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

In December 2007, the FASB issued an update to ASC 810,

Consolidation,

which requires a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be identified in the consolidated financial statements.  It also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parent’s ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation.  The amended guidance became effective on January 1, 2009 and resulted in (i) the reclassification of minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiarie
s, a component of permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheets, (ii) the reclassification of minority interest expense to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, on our consolidated statements of income, and (iii) additional disclosures, including a consolidated statement of changes in equity in quarterly reporting periods.

In December 2007, the FASB issued an update to ASC 805,

Business Combinations

, which

applies to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses.  It also broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and interests transferred as a result of business combinations; and acquisition related costs will generally be expensed rather than included as part of the basis of the acquisition.  The amended guidance also expands required disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. The amended guidance b
ecame effective for all transactions entered into on or after January 1, 2009.

The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2009 did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements because there have been no acquisitions during 2009.

In March 2008, the FASB issued an update to ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging,

which requires enhanced disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities, including disclosures regarding how an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and the impact of derivative instruments and related hedged items on an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows.  It also provided a new two-step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer’s own stock.  The amended guidance became effective on January 1, 2009.  The adoption of this guidance on Januar
y 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2008, the FASB issued an update to ASC 260,

Earnings Per Share,

which requires companies to treat unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents as “participating securities” and include such securities in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method as described in ASC 260.  The amended guidance became effective on January 1, 2009 and required all prior period earnings per share data presented, to be adjusted retroactively.  The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on our computation of income per share.

In April 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the guidance for other than temporary impairments (“OTTI”) of investments in debt securities, which changes the presentation of OTTI in financial statements.  Under this guidance, if an OTTI debt security is intended to be sold or required to be sold prior to the recovery of its carrying amount, the full amount of the impairment loss is charged to earnings.  Otherwise, losses on debt securities must be separated into two categories, the portion which is considered credit loss, which is charged to earnings, and the portion due to other factors, which is charged to other comprehensive income (loss), a component of balance sheet equity.  When an unrealized loss on a fixed maturity security is not considered OTTI, the unrealized loss continues to be charged to other comprehensive income (loss) and not to earn
ings. The adoption of this guidance on April 1, 2009 did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued an update to ASC 810,

Consolidation

, which modifies the existing quantitative guidance used in determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”) by requiring entities to qualitatively assess whether an enterprise is a primary beneficiary, based on whether the entity has (i) power over the significant activities of the VIE, and (ii) an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE.  The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2010 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.


Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.  The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Real Estate

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $15.455 billion and $15.652 billion, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. If we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated.

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles such as acquired above and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including historical operating results, known trends and market/economic conditions.

Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment each quarter, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis.  An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared.  If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods or market conditions change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our
 consolidated financial statements.  The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.  Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.

Identified Intangibles

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases, tenant relationships and acquired in-place leases), a component of “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets, were $442,510,000 and $522,719,000, respectively. The carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of “deferred credit” on our consolidated balance sheets, were $633,492,000 and $719,822,000, respectively.  Identified intangibles are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date, separate and apart from goodwill. Identified intangibles that are determined to have finite lives are amortized over the period in which they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired.  Intangible assets that are subject to amortization
 are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset, including related real estate, if appropriate, is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value.  If intangible assets are impaired or estimated useful lives change, the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material.


Critical Accounting Policies – continued

Mezzanine Loans Receivable

We invest in mezzanine loans to entities that have significant real estate assets.  These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate.  We record investments in mezzanine loans at the stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying amounts of “mezzanine loans receivable, net” were $203,286,000 and $472,539,000, respectively. We accrete or amortize any discounts or premiums over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest method, or straight-line method if the result is not materially different. We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans each quarter, if circumstances warrant, in
 determining whether they are impaired. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the estimated fair value of the loan or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If our estimates of the collectibility of both interest and principal or the fair value of our loans change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Partially Owned Entities

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying amounts of investments and advances to partially owned entities, including Alexander’s and Toys “R” Us, were $1.209 billion and $1.083 billion, respectively. In determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we have the power over significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses, if they occur, or receive a majority of the expected residual returns, if they occur, or both. We account for 
investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method.

Our investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment each quarter, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other-than-temporary.  If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.  
;  The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.

Allowance For Doubtful Accounts

We periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts ($46,708,000 and $32,834,000 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents ($4,680,000 and $5,773,000 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively). This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.


Critical Accounting Policies – continued

Revenue Recognition

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:

·

Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.  We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use.  In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straigh
t-line basis over the term of the lease.

·

Percentage Rent — income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon sales of the tenants exceeding defined thresholds. These rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., sales thresholds have been achieved).

·

Hotel Revenue — income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered.

·

Trade Shows Revenue — income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred.

·

Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.

·

Management, Leasing and Other Fees — income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.

Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among other things, its collectibility. If our assessment of the collectibility of revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material.

Income Taxes

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, or fail to meet other REIT requirements, we may fail to qualify as a REIT which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences.

Net income and EBITDA

(1)

by Segment for the Years Ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 – continued

Notes to the preceding tabular information:

(1)

EBITDA represents “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.”  We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flows and may not be c
omparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)

Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax (benefit) expense in the reconciliation of net income to EBITDA include our share of these items from partially owned entities.

(3)

Other EBITDA is comprised of:

In December 2009, our agreement to sell an 8.6 acre parcel of land in the Pentagon City area of Arlington, Virginia, was terminated by the buyer.  Accordingly, we recognized $27,089 of income, representing the buyer’s forfeited non-refundable purchase deposit.  In connection therewith, we wrote down the carrying amount of the land to its fair value and recognized a $24,875 impairment loss which is included as a component of “impairment and other losses” on our consolidated statement of income

.

(1)

Results from a $7,025 increase in BMS operating expenses and a $6,333 increase in property level operating expenses, primarily due to higher real estate taxes.

(2)

Primarily due to a $8,190 decrease in bad debt expense partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes which are reimbursed by tenants.

(3)

Results primarily from an increase in the elimination of inter-company fees of our operating segments upon consolidation.

(4)

Primarily due to a lease modification that reduced the term of a portion of AXA’s space at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, which resulted in additional depreciation of approximately $16,000 in the prior year.

(5)

On March 31, 2009, our nine most senior executives voluntarily surrendered their 2007 and 2008 stock option awards and their 2008 out-performance plan awards.  Accordingly, we recognized $32,588 of expense in the first quarter of 2009, representing the unamortized portion of these awards.

(6)

This increase in expense is entirely offset by a corresponding increase in income from the mark-to-market of the deferred compensation plan assets, a component of “interest and other investment income” on our consolidated statement of income.

(7)

Primarily due to 2009 pension plan termination costs of $2,800.

(8)

Primarily due to lower payroll and stock-based compensation expense.

Income Applicable to Alexander’s

Our 32.4% share of Alexander’s net income (comprised of our share of Alexander’s net income, management, leasing and development fees) was $53,529,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $36,671,000 for the prior year, an increase of $16,858,000. The increase was primarily due to $13,668,000 of income for our share of an income tax benefit and $11,105,000 for our share of the reversal of a portion of previously recognized stock appreciation rights compensation expense in the current year, compared to $6,583,000 for our share of such income in the prior year.

Income (loss) Applicable to Toys

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized $92,300,000 of income from our investment in Toys, comprised of (i) $71,601,000 for our 32.7% share of Toys’ net income ($58,416,000 before our share of Toys’ income tax benefit), (ii) $13,946,000 for our share of income from the reversal of previously recognized deferred financing cost amortization expense, which we initially recorded as a reduction of the basis of our investment in Toys, and (iii) $6,753,000 of interest and other income.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized $2,380,000 of income from our investment in Toys, comprised of (i) $9,115,000 for our 32.7% share of Toys’ net income ($53,867,000 before our share of Toys’ income tax expense) and (ii) $8,165,000 of interest and other income, partially offset by (iii) $14,900,000 for our share of a non-cash charge adjusting Toys purchase accounting basis income tax expense resulting from the audit of Toys fiscal 2006 and 2007 purchase accounting financial statements.

This decrease resulted primarily from savings of (i) $17,561,000 from a decrease in outstanding debt of approximately $1.5 billion, the full year effect of which is approximately $100,000,000, (ii) $27,830,000 from lower average interest rates on variable rate debt (1.61% in 2009 as compared to 3.88% in 2008), (iii) $1,857,000 from other items, partially offset by (iv) a decrease in capitalized interest of $45,807,000.

Net (Loss) Gain on Early Extinguishment of Debt

Net loss on early extinguishment of debt was $25,915,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting primarily from the acquisition and retirement of approximately $1.9 billion of our convertible senior debentures and related write-off of the unamortized debt discount.  Net gain on early extinguishment of debt was $9,820,000 in the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting primarily from the acquisition and retirement of approximately $81,540,000 of senior unsecured notes and $27,500,000 of convertible senior debentures.

Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate

Net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate was $5,641,000 in the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $7,757,000 in the prior year and was primarily comprised of net gains on sale of marketable securities and residential condominiums.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense was $20,737,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to an income tax benefit of $204,537,000 in the prior year.  The prior year income tax benefit was the result of a $222,174,000 reversal of deferred taxes recorded in connection with our acquisition of H Street.  We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of January 16, 2008, we had completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008 and reversed the deferred tax liabilities.

Discontinued Operations

The combined results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 include the operating results of 1999 K Street, which was sold on September 1, 2009; Americold, which was sold on March 31, 2008 and Tysons Dulles Plaza, which was sold on June 10, 2008.

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests, Including Unit Distributions

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 is comprised of (i) allocations of income to redeemable noncontrolling interests of $5,834,000 and $33,327,000, respectively, (ii) net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries of $2,839,000 and $3,263,000, respectively and (iii) preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership of $19,286,000 and $22,084,000, respectively.  The decrease of $27,493,000 in allocations of income to redeemable noncontrolling interests resulted primarily from lower net income subject to allocation to the unitholders.  The decrease of $2,798,000 in preferred unit distributions was primarily due to a write-off of unit issuance costs in the prior year.

Preferred Share Dividends

Preferred share dividends were $57,076,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $57,091,000 for the prior year.

Same Store EBITDA

Same store EBITDA represents EBITDA from property level operations which are owned by us in both the current and prior year reporting periods.  Same store EBITDA excludes segment-level overhead expenses that are not considered property-level expenses, as well as other non-operating items.  We present same store EBITDA on both a GAAP basis and a cash basis, which excludes income from the straight-lining of rents, amortization of below-market leases, net of above-market leases and other non-cash adjustments. We present these non-GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers.  Same store EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative t
o net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(1)

Results from an $11,715 increase in BMS operating expenses and a $12,792 increase in property level operating expenses.

(2)

Includes $6,990 of write-offs for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents and $2,492 of bad debt expense, all relating to tenants that filed for bankruptcy.  Of these amounts, $3,931 and $1,203, respectively, relate to Circuit City.

(3)

Primarily due to higher bad debt expense, partially offset by lower real estate taxes.

(4)

Results primarily from an increase in the elimination of inter-company fees of our operating segments upon consolidation.

(5)

Primarily due to a $15,344 reduction from the mark-to-market of investments in our deferred compensation plan (for which there is a corresponding reduction in “interest and other investment (loss) income, net”), partially offset by a $4,600 pension termination cost, higher compensation expense and professional fees.

Income Applicable to Alexander’s

Our 32.5% share of Alexander’s net income (comprised of our share of Alexander’s net income, management, leasing and development fees) was $36,671,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $50,589,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $13,918,000. The decrease was primarily due to $6,583,000 of income for our share of the reversal of accrued stock appreciation rights compensation expense, compared to $14,280,000 of income from such reversal in the prior year.

Income (loss) Applicable to Toys

Our 32.7% share of Toys’ financial results (comprised of our share of Toys’ net income, interest income on loans receivable, and management fees) for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 are for Toys fiscal periods from November 4, 2007 to November 1, 2008 and October 29, 2006 to November 3, 2007, respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 2008, our income applicable to Toys was $2,380,000, or $62,032,000 before our share of Toys’ income tax expense, compared to a loss of $14,337,000 or $25,235,000 before our share of Toys’ income tax benefit in the prior year.

Interest and Other Investment (Loss) Income, net

Interest and other investment (loss) income, net (comprised of mark-to-market of derivative positions, interest income on mezzanine loans receivable, other interest and dividend income and impairment losses on marketable securities) was a loss of $2,682,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to income of $226,425,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, a decrease of $229,107,000. This decrease resulted primarily from:

Interest and Debt Expense

Interest and debt expense was $635,724,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $599,804,000 in the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $35,920,000.  This increase was primarily due to the full year effect of interest expense from properties acquired during 2007 and property level refinancings during 2008, partially offset by a decrease in weighted average interest rates on variable rate debt.

Net Gain on Early Extinguishment of Debt

In the year ended December 31, 2008, we had a $9,820,000 net gain from the early extinguishment of debt which resulted primarily from purchases of certain of our convertible senior debentures.

Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate

Net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate was $7,757,000 in the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $39,493,000 in the year ended December 31, 2007.  The year ended December 31, 2008 includes a $3,691,000 net gain on sale of residential condominiums, a $2,038,000 net gain on disposition of our 13.8% interest in GMH and $2,028,000 for net gains on sale of marketable securities.  The $39,493,000 net gain in the year ended December 31, 2007 represents net gains on sale of marketable securities, including $23,090,000 from the sale of McDonald’s common shares.

Income Tax Expense

In the year ended December 31, 2008, we had an income tax benefit of $204,537,000, compared to an expense of $9,179,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $213,716,000.  The decrease results primarily from a $222,174,000 reversal of deferred taxes recorded in connection with the acquisition of H Street.  We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of January 16, 2008, we had completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008.  Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, we reversed the deferred tax liabilities and recognized an income tax benefit of $222,174,000 in our consolidated statement of income.

Discontinued Operations

The combined results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 include the operating results of 1999 K Street, which was sold on September 1, 2009; Americold, which was sold on March 31, 2008; Tysons Dulles Plaza, which was sold on June 10, 2008; 11 acres of land we acquired as part of our acquisition of H Street, which was sold in September 2007; Vineland, New Jersey, which was sold on July 16, 2007; Crystal Mall Two, which was sold on August 9, 2007; and Arlington Plaza, which was sold on October 17, 2007.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 is comprised of (i) allocations of income to redeemable noncontrolling interests of $33,327,000 and $50,514,000, respectively, (ii) net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries of $3,263,000 and $3,494,000, respectively and (iii) preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership of $22,084,000 and $19,274,000, respectively.  The decrease of $17,187,000 in allocations of income to redeemable noncontrolling interests resulted primarily from lower net income subject to allocation to the unitholders.

Preferred Share Dividends

Preferred share dividends were $57,091,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $57,177,000 for the prior year.

Supplemental Information – continued

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore comparisons of the current quarter to the previous quarter. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys’ fourth quarter net income, which we recorded on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. The Merchandise Mart segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage rental income.

Related Party Transactions

Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees

Alexander’s

We own 32.4% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President and Chief Executive Officer, are officers and directors of Alexander’s.  We provide various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements.  These agreements are described in Note 3 - Investments in Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

On March 2, 2009, Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli each exercised 150,000 stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) which were scheduled to expire on March 4, 2009 and each received gross proceeds of $11,419,000.

On September 9, 2008, Alexander’s Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $7.00 per share, payable on October 30, 2008, to shareholders of record on October 14, 2008.  The dividend was attributable to the liquidation of the wholly owned 731 Lexington Avenue taxable REIT subsidiary into Alexander’s.  Accordingly, on October 30, we received $11,578,000, which was accounted for as a reduction of our investment in Alexander’s.

On September 15, 2008 and October 14, 2008, Mr. Roth exercised an aggregate of 200,000 SARs which were scheduled to expire on March 4, 2009 and received gross proceeds of $62,809,000.

Interstate Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr. Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s, are Interstate’s two other partners. As of December 31, 2009, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned approximately 7.3% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 27.2% of Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days’ notice at the end of the term. We believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies, that the management agreement terms are fair to us. We earned $782,000, $803,000 and $800,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures.  Capital requirements for significant acquisitions and development expenditures may require funding from borrowings and/or equity offerings.

We may from time to time purchase or retire outstanding debt or equity securities.  Such purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors.  The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

We may determine to raise capital for future real estate acquisitions through an institutional investment fund.  We would serve as the general partner of the fund and would also expect to be a limited partner of the fund and have the potential to earn certain incentives based on the fund’s performance.  The fund may serve as our exclusive investment vehicle for a limited period of time for all investments that fit within the fund’s investment parameters.  If we determine to raise capital through a fund, the partnership interests offered would not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and could not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under that act or an applicable exemption from those registration requirements.

Acquisitions and Investments

We did not make any significant investments in real estate during 2009.

Financings

In April 2009, we sold 17,250,000 common shares, including underwriters’ over-allotment, in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement at an initial public offering price of $43.00 per share.  We received net proceeds of $710,226,000, after underwriters’ discount and offering expenses and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 17,250,000 Class A units of the Operating Partnership.

On September 30, 2009, we completed a public offering of $460,000,000 principal amount of 7.875% callable senior unsecured 30-year notes (NYSE: VNOD) due October 1, 2039.  The notes were sold to the public at par and may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, beginning in October 2014 at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

We received net proceeds of approximately $446,000,000 from the offering which were used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes.

During 2009, we purchased $1,912,724,000 (aggregate face amount) of our convertible senior debentures and $352,740,000 (aggregate face amount) of our senior unsecured notes for $1,877,510,000 and $343,694,000 in cash, respectively.  This debt was acquired through tender offers and in the open market and has been retired.   We also repaid $650,285,000 of existing property level debt and completed $277,000,000 of property level financings.  In connection with the above, we recognized an aggregate net loss of $25,915,000 from the early extinguishment of debt on our consolidated statement of income

We continue to evaluate plans to renovate and reposition the Springfield mall; given current economic conditions, that may require us to renegotiate the terms of the existing debt and, accordingly, we have requested that the debt be placed with the special servicer.

Dispositions

On September 1, 2009, we sold 1999 K Street, a newly developed 250,000 square foot office building in Washington’s Central Business District, for $207,800,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $41,211,000, which is included as a component of “income from discontinued operations” on our consolidated statement of income.

During 2009, we sold 15 retail properties in separate transactions for an aggregate of $55,000,000 in cash, which resulted in net gains aggregating $4,073,000, which is included as a component of “income from discontinued operations” on our consolidated statement of income.

Mezzanine Loans

On June 1, 2009, we were repaid the entire $41,758,000 balance of the Charles Square Hotel loan including accrued interest.  This loan was scheduled to mature in September 2009.

On January 28, 2010, we were repaid the entire $99,314,000 balance of the Equinox loan including accrued interest.  This loan, which we acquired in 2006 for $57,500,000, was scheduled to mature in February 2013.

Certain Future Cash Requirements

Development and Redevelopment Expenditures

We are currently engaged in various development/redevelopment projects for which we have budgeted approximately $200,000,000. Of this amount, $78,118,000 was expended prior to 2009 and $50,513,000 was expended during 2009.  Substantially all of the estimated costs to complete our development projects aggregating approximately $71,000,000 are anticipated to be expended during 2010, of which approximately $18,000,000 is expected to be funded by existing construction loans.

The table above excludes anticipated capital expenditures of non-consolidated entities, including Alexander’s, Toys and Lexington, as these entities fund their capital expenditures without additional equity contributions from us.

Dividends

On January 13, 2010, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.65 per common share, payable all in cash on February 22, 2010.  This dividend policy, if continued for all of 2010, would require approximately $507,000,000 of cash in the aggregate for common share dividends.  In addition, we expect to pay cash dividends on outstanding preferred shares during 2010 aggregating approximately $57,000,000.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations

We believe that we have complied with the financial covenants required by our revolving credit facilities and our senior unsecured notes and that as of December 31, 2009 we have the ability to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness.  We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity securities and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a “well-known seasoned issuer.”

Our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

Insurance

We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, including coverage for terrorist acts, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods.  Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $150,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, and a $150,000,000 annual aggregate.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by TRIPRA.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC.  Our coverage for NBCR losses is up to $2 billion per occurrence, for which PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and 15% of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of a covered loss.  We are ultimately responsible for any loss borne by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance and/or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us.  However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space.  These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or  repayment of the underlying loans.  As of December 31, 2009, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $135,000,000.

At December 31, 2009, $37,232,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under our $0

.

965 billion revolving credit facility.  Our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

We are committed to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $90,406,000.  Of this amount, $71,788,000 is committed to the India Property Fund and is pledged as collateral to its lender.

Litigation

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including the matters referred to below, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (“USDC-NJ”) claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that a prior order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York dated February 6, 2001, as modified on appeal to the District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 13, 2001, froze our right to reallocate which effectively terminated our right to collect the additional rent from Stop & Shop. On March 3, 2003, 
after we moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Stop & Shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint. On March 26, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a new complaint in New York State Supreme Court, asserting substantially the same claims as in its USDC-NJ complaint. We removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In January 2005 that court remanded the action to the New York State Supreme Court. On February 14, 2005, we served an answer in which we asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the mo
tions for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Court’s decision and on December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Court’s decision.  On January 16, 2007, we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Court’s decision which was denied on March 13, 2007.  Discovery is now complete.  On October 19, 2009, Stop & Shop filed a motion for leave to amend its pleadings to assert new claims for relief, including a claim for damages in an unspecified amount, and an additional affirmative defense.  The motion was argued and submitted for decision on December 18, 2009.  The course of future proceedings will depend upon the outcome of Stop & Shop’s motion, but we anticipate that a trial date will be set for some time in 2010.  We intend to vigorously pursue our claims against Stop & Shop.  In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a
 material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

On May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas and the 555 California Street complex.  Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties.  The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump.  In August 2005, Mr. Trump brought a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court against, among others, the general partners of the partnerships referred to above relating to a dispute over the sale of properties located on the former Penn Central rail yards between West 59th and 72nd Streets in Manhattan which were formerly owned by the partnerships.  In decisions iss
ued in 2006, 2007 and 2009, the New York State Supreme Court dismissed all of Mr. Trump’s claims, and those decisions were affirmed by the Appellate Division.  Mr. Trump cannot further appeal those decisions.

In July 2005, we acquired H Street Building Corporation (“H Street”) which has a subsidiary that owns, among other things, a 50% tenancy in common interest in land located in Arlington County, Virginia, known as "Pentagon Row," leased to two tenants.  In April 2007, H Street acquired the remaining 50% interest in that fee.  In April 2007, we received letters from those tenants, Street Retail, Inc. and Post Apartment Homes, L.P., claiming they had a right of first offer triggered by each of those transactions. On September 25, 2008, both tenants filed suit against us and the former owners.  The claim alleges the right to purchase the fee interest, damages in excess of $75,000,000 and punitive damages.  We believe this claim is without merit and regardless of merit, in our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, this c
laim will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Cash Flow for the Year Ended December 31, 2009

Property rental income is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties.   Other sources of liquidity to fund cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, and our revolving credit facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity; and asset sales.  Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, distributions to common and preferred shareholders, as well as acquisition and development costs.  Our cash and cash equivalents were $535,479,000 at December 31, 2009, a $991,374,000 decrease over the balance at December 31, 2008.  This decrease was the result of the acquisition of our convertible senior debentures and senior unsecured notes 
during 2009, partially offset by cash flows from operating activities as discussed below.

This decrease resulted primarily from the acquisition of our convertible senior debentures and senior unsecured notes during 2009.  As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, $852,218,000 and $358,468,000, respectively, was outstanding under our revolving credit facilities.  During 2010 and 2011, $538,458,000 and $2,448,053,000 of our outstanding debt matures, respectively. We may refinance such debt or choose to repay all or a portion, using existing cash balances or our revolving credit facilities.

Our share of debt of unconsolidated subsidiaries was $3,149,640,000 at December 31, 2009, a $46,945,000 decrease from the balance at December 31, 2008.

Cash flows provided by operating activities of $633,579,000 was comprised of (i) net income of $128,450,000, (ii) $620,523,000 of non-cash adjustments, including depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash impairment losses, the effect of straight-lining of rental income, equity in net income of partially owned entities and (iii) distributions of income from partially owned entities of $30,473,000, partially offset by (iv) the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $145,867,000.

Net cash used in financing activities of $1,382,752,000 was primarily comprised of (i) acquisition and retirement of convertible senior debentures and senior unsecured notes of $2,221,204,000, (ii) repayment of borrowings of $2,075,236,000, (iii) dividends paid on common shares of $262,397,000, (iv) dividends paid on preferred shares of $57,078,000, (v) distributions to noncontrolling interests of $42,449,000, (vi) repurchase of shares related to stock compensation arrangements and related tax withholdings of $32,203,000, (vii) redemption of redeemable noncontrolling interests of $24,330,000, (viii) debt issuance and other costs of $30,186,000, partially offset by, (ix) proceeds from borrowings of $2,648,175,000 and (xi) proceeds from issuance of common shares of $710,226,000.

Capital Expenditures

Our capital expenditures consist of expenditures to maintain assets, tenant improvements and leasing commissions.  Recurring capital improvements include expenditures to maintain a property’s competitive position within the market and tenant improvements and leasing commissions necessary to re-lease expiring leases or renew or extend existing leases.  Non-recurring capital improvements include expenditures completed in the year of acquisition and the following two years that were planned at the time of acquisition as well as tenant improvements and leasing commissions for space that was vacant at the time of acquisition of a property.  Our development and redevelopment expenditures include all hard and soft costs associated with the development or redevelopment of a property, including tenant improvements, leasing commissions and capitalized interest and
 operating costs until the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.

Funds From Operations (“FFO”)

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets and GAAP extraordinary items, and to include depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate dimin
ishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions.  FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flows as a liquidity measure.  FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.  The calculations of both the numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note 15 –

Income per Share

, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements on page 153 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $583,596,000, or $3.36 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $813,064,000 or $4.97 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2008. FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $20,000 or $0.00 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2009 compared to negative FFO of $88,154,000, or $0.57 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2008.  Details of certain items that affect comparability are discussed in the financial results summary of our “Overview.”

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We have exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control.

We may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. As of December 31, 2009, variable rate debt with an aggregate principal amount of $507,750,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.49% was subject to LIBOR caps.  These caps are based on a notional amount of $507,750,000 and cap LIBOR at a weighted average rate of 5.39%.

As of December 31, 2009, we have investments in mezzanine loans with an aggregate carrying amount of $203,286,000 that are based on variable interest rates which partially mitigate our exposure to a change in interest rates on our variable rate debt.

Fair Value of Our Debt

The estimated fair value of our debt at December 31, 2009 was less than its aggregate carrying amount by approximately $501,467,000 based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at the current interest rates at which we believe similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt.


ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board of Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vornado Realty Trust (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Vornado Realty Trust at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, on January 1, 2009, the Company changed its method of accounting for debt with conversion options and noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries and retrospectively adjusted all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

2.    Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vornado Realty Trust and its majority-owned subsidiary, Vornado Realty L.P. All significant inter-company amounts have been eliminated. We account for unconsolidated partially owned entities on the equity method of accounting.  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  Certain prior year balances have been reclassified in order to conform to current year 
presentation.

On July 1, 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) established the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) as the primary source of authoritative GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities.  Although the establishment of the ASC did not change current GAAP, it did change the way we refer to GAAP throughout this document to reflect the updated referencing convention.

Impact of Retrospective Application of New Accounting Pronouncements

During 2009, we paid quarterly dividends to our common shareholders in a combination of cash and stock and retrospectively adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding in the computations of income per share to include the additional common shares resulting from these dividends in the earliest periods presented in each of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2009, June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009 and our Current Report on Form 8-K, issued on October 13, 2009, in which we elected to recast our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A (Amendment No. 1) for the year ended December 31, 2008.  On December 2, 2009, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in EITF 09-E,

Accounting for Distribution to Shareholders with Components of St
ock and Cash (“EITF 09-E”)

as codified through Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2010-1 to ASC 505,

Equity.

EITF 09-E requires an entity to include the additional common shares resulting from the stock portion of these distributions prospectively in the periods following their issuance in all computations of income per share rather than retrospectively as we had previously done.  As a result, we have adjusted our computations of income per share presented herein to exclude the additional shares resulting from these dividends in periods prior to their issuance.  Below is a reconciliation of previously reported income per share to the amounts presented herein.

2.    Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies - continued

On January 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of ASC 470-20,

Debt with Conversion and Other Options

, which was required to be applied retrospectively.

The adoption affected the accounting for our convertible

and exchangeable senior debentures by requiring

the initial proceeds from their sale to be allocated between a debt component and an equity component

in a manner that results in interest expense on the debt component at our nonconvertible 
debt borrowing rate on the date of issue.  The initial debt components of our $1.4 billion Convertible Senior Debentures, $1 billion Convertible Senior Debentures and $500 million Exchangeable Senior Debentures were $1,241,286,000, $926,361,000 and $457,699,000, respectively, based on the fair value of similar nonconvertible instruments issued at that time.  The aggregate initial debt discount of $216,655,000 after original issuance costs allocated to the equity component was recorded in “additional capital” in our consolidated statement of changes in equity.  The discount is amortized using the effective interest method over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding (i.e., the earliest date the holders may require us to repurchase the debentures), which resulted in $39,546,000 and $30,418,000 of additional interest expense in the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

In December 2007, the FASB issued an update to ASC 810,

Consolidation,

which requires a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be identified in the consolidated financial statements.  It also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parent’s ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation.  The amended guidance became effective on January 1, 2009 and resulted in (i) the reclassification of minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiarie
s, a component of permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheets, (ii) the reclassification of minority interest expense to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, on our consolidated statements of income, and (iii) additional disclosures, including a consolidated statement of changes in equity in quarterly reporting periods.

In December 2007, the FASB issued an update to ASC 805,

Business Combinations,

which

applies to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses.  It also broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and interests transferred as a result of business combinations; and acquisition related costs will generally be expensed rather than included as part of the basis of the acquisition.  The amended guidance also expands required disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. The amended guidance b
ecame effective for all transactions entered into on or after January 1, 2009.

The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2009 did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements because there have been no acquisitions during 2009.

In March 2008, the FASB issued an update to ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging,

which requires enhanced disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities, including disclosures regarding how an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and the impact of derivative instruments and related hedged items on an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows.  It also provided a new two-step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer’s own stock.  The amended guidance became effective on January 1, 2009.  The adoption of this guidance on Januar
y 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2008, the FASB issued an update to ASC 260,

Earnings Per Share,

which requires companies to treat unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents as “participating securities” and include such securities in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method as described in ASC 260.  The amended guidance became effective on January 1, 2009 and required all prior period earnings per share data presented, to be adjusted retroactively.  The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on our computation of income per share.

In April 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the guidance for other than temporary impairments (“OTTI”) of investments in debt securities, which changes the presentation of OTTI in financial statements.  Under this guidance, if an OTTI debt security is intended to be sold or required to be sold prior to the recovery of its carrying amount, the full amount of the impairment loss is charged to earnings.  Otherwise, losses on debt securities must be separated into two categories, the portion which is considered credit loss, which is charged to earnings, and the portion due to other factors, which is charged to other comprehensive income (loss), a component of balance sheet equity.  When an unrealized loss on a fixed maturity security is not considered OTTI, the unrealized loss continues to be charged to other comprehensive income (loss) and not to earn
ings. The adoption of this guidance on April 1, 2009 did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued an update to ASC 810,

Consolidation,

which modifies the existing quantitative guidance used in determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”) by requiring entities to qualitatively assess whether an enterprise is a primary beneficiary, based on whether the entity has (i) power over the significant activities of the VIE, and (ii) an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE.    The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2010 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Significant Accounting Policies

Real Estate:

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly related to the improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete. If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the undepreciated net book value of the property carried forward, exceeds the estimated fair value of redeveloped pr
operty, the excess is charged to expense. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40 years. Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximate the useful lives of the assets. Additions to real estate include interest expense capitalized during construction of $17,256,000 and $63,063,000, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles such as acquired above and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions.

Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment each quarter, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis.  An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared.  If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to ou
r consolidated financial statements.  The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.  Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.  The table below summarizes non-cash impairment and other losses recognized in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Identified Intangibles:

We record acquired intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases, tenant relationships and acquired in-place leases) and acquired intangible liabilities (including below–market leases) at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. We amortize identified intangibles that have finite lives over the period they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset, including related real estate, if appropriate, is not rec
overable and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.  As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets, a component of “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets, were $442,510,000 and $522,719,000, respectively. In addition, the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of “deferred credit” on our consolidated balance sheets, were $633,492,000 and $719,822,000, respectively.

Partially Owned Entities:

In determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we have power over significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses, if they occur, or receive a majority of the expected residual returns, if they occur, or both. We have concluded that we do not control a p
artially owned entity if the entity is not considered a variable interest entity and the approval of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect to major decisions, such as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange or other disposition of real property, the hiring of a chief executive officer, the commencement, compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or arbitration or the placement of new or additional financing secured by assets of the venture. This is the case with respect to our 50% interests in Monmouth Mall, MartParc Wells, MartParc Orleans, 968 Third Avenue, West 57

th

Street properties and 825 Seventh Avenue. We account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions made dur
ing the year. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method.

Our investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment each quarter, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment loss if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other-than-temporary.  The table below summarizes non-cash impairment losses recognized on investments in partially owned entities in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Mezzanine Loans Receivable:

We invest in mezzanine loans to entities which have significant real estate assets.  These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate.  We record these investments at the stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium. We accrete or amortize any discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan receivable utilizing the effective interest method, or straight-line method if the result is not materially different.

We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans each quarter, if circumstances warrant, to determine whether they are impaired. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the estimated fair value of the loan or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  Interest on impaired loans is recognized when received in cash.  In the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2007, we recorded loss accruals aggregating $190,738,000 and $57,000,000, respectively.  In 2008, upon sale of a sub-participation in a loan, we reversed $1
0,300,000 of the $57,000,000 loss accrual recognized in 2007.  Loss accruals are based on our continuing review of these loans and while management believes it uses the best information available to establish these allowances, future adjustments may become necessary if there are changes in economic conditions or specific circumstances.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks which may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit.  To date, we have not experienced any losses on our invested cash.

Short-term Investments:

Short-term investments consist of certificates of deposit placed through an account registry service (“CDARS”) with original maturities of 91 to 180 days.  These investments are FDIC insured and classified as available-for-sale.

Restricted Cash:

Restricted cash consists of security deposits, cash restricted in connection with our deferred compensation plan and cash escrowed under loan agreements for debt service, real estate taxes, property insurance and capital improvements.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:

We periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents. This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates.  As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had $46,708,000 and $32,834,000, respectively, in allowances for doubtful accounts.  In addition, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we h
ad $4,680,000 and $5,773,000, respectively, in allowances for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents.

Deferred Charges:

Direct financing costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements as a component of interest expense. Direct costs related to successful leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a straight‑line basis over the lives of the related leases. All other deferred charges are amortized on a straight‑line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, in accordance with the terms of the agreements to which they relate.

Revenue Recognition:

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:

·

Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.  We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use.  In addition, in circumstances in which we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a red
uction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

·

Percentage Rent — income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold. These rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., sales thresholds have been achieved).

·

Hotel Revenue — income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue is recognized when the services have been rendered.

·

Trade Shows Revenue — income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred.

·

Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.

·

Management, Leasing and Other Fees – income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.

Condominium Units Held For Sale:

Condominium units held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or expected net sales proceeds.  As of December 31, 2009, condominiums held for sale, which are included in “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheet, aggregate $187,050,000 and consist of substantially completed units at our 40 East 66

th

Street property in Manhattan, The Bryant in Boston and Granite Park in Pasadena.  Revenue from individual condominium unit sales are recognized upon closing of the sale (the “completed contract method”), as all conditions for full profit recognition have been met at that time.  We use the relative sales value method to allocate costs.  Net gains on sales of condominiums units are included in “net ga
ins on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate” on our consolidated statements of income.  During 2009 and 2008, we recognized non-cash impairment losses related to certain of these condominiums aggregating $13,667,000 and $23,625,000, respectively, based on our assessments of the expected net sales proceeds associated with these condominium projects.  These losses are included in “impairment and other losses” on our consolidated statements of income.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities:

ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, our derivative instruments consisted of interest rate caps which did not have a material affect on our consolidated financial statements. As required by ASC 815, we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting desig
nation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings. We assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction. For derivatives not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in e
arnings.

Income Per Share:

Basic income per share is computed based on weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted income per share considers the effect of all potentially dilutive share equivalents, including outstanding employee stock options, restricted shares and convertible or redeemable securities.

Stock-Based Compensation:

Stock-based compensation consists of awards to certain employees and officers and consists of stock options, restricted stock, restricted Operating Partnership units and out-performance plan awards.  We account for all stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,

Compensation – Stock Compensation

Income Taxes:

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856‑860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to shareholders 100% of taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.  Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2009, were characterized, for Federal income tax purposes, as 63.9% ordinary income, 0.9% long-term capital gain and 35.2% return of capital.  Dividend distributions for the year end
ed December 31, 2008 were characterized, for Federal income tax purposes, as 70.8% ordinary income and 29.2% return of capital. Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2007 were characterized, for Federal income tax purposes, as 61.6% ordinary income and 38.4% long-term capital gain.

We have elected to treat certain consolidated subsidiaries, and may in the future elect to treat newly formed subsidiaries, as taxable REIT subsidiaries pursuant to an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code that became effective January 1, 2001.  Taxable REIT subsidiaries may participate in non-real estate related activities and/or perform non-customary services for tenants and are subject to Federal and State income tax at regular corporate tax rates. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries had a combined current income tax liability of approximately $21,481,000 and $20,837,000 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and have immaterial differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities.

In connection with purchase accounting for H Street, in July 2005 and April 2007 we recorded an aggregate of $222,174,000 of deferred tax liabilities representing the differences between the tax basis and the book basis of the acquired assets and liabilities multiplied by the effective tax rate.  We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of January 16, 2008, we had completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008.  Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, we reversed the deferred tax liabilities and recognized an income tax benefit of $222,174,000 in our consolidated statement of income.

Toys

As of December 31, 2009, we own 32.7% of Toys.  The business of Toys is highly seasonal.  Historically, Toys’ fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income.  We account for our investment in Toys under the equity method and because Toys’ fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, we record our 32.7% share of Toys’ net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis.  As of December 31, 2009, the carrying amount of our investment in Toys does not differ materially from our share of the equity in net assets of Toys on a purchase accounting basis.

During 2009, we recognized $13,946,000 for our share of income from the reversal of previously recognized deferred financing cost amortization expense, which we initially recorded as a reduction of the basis of our investment in Toys.  During 2008, in connection with an audit of Toys’ purchase accounting basis financial statements for its fiscal years 2006 and 2007, it was determined that the purchase accounting basis income tax expense was understated.  Accordingly, we recognized $14,900,000 of income tax expense for our share of this non-cash charge.  This non-cash charge had no effect on cash actually paid for income taxes or Toys’ previously issued Recap basis consolidated financial statements.

Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX) (“Alexander’s”)

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we owned 32.4% and 32.5%, respectively, of the outstanding common shares of Alexander’s.  We manage, lease and develop Alexander’s properties pursuant to the agreements described below which expire in March of each year and are automatically renewable.  At December 31, 2009 the market value (“fair value” pursuant to ASC 820) of our investment in Alexander’s, based on Alexander’s December 31, 2009 closing share price of $304.42, was $503,531,000, or $310,357,000 in excess of the carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet.

As of December 31, 2009, the carrying amount of our investment in Alexander’s excluding amounts owed to us, exceeds our share of the equity in the net assets of Alexander’s by approximately $61,261,000.  The majority of this basis difference resulted from the excess of our purchase price for the Alexander’s common stock acquired over the book value of Alexander’s net assets.  Substantially all of this basis difference was allocated, based on our estimates of the fair values of Alexander’s assets and liabilities, to real estate (land and buildings).  We are amortizing the basis difference related to the buildings into earnings as additional depreciation expense over their estimated useful lives.  This depreciation is not material to our share of equity in Alexander’s net income or 
loss.  The basis difference related to the land will be recognized upon disposition of our investment.

Leasing Agreements

We provide Alexander’s with leasing services for a fee of 3% of rent for the first ten years of a lease term, 2% of rent for the eleventh through twentieth year of a lease term and 1% of rent for the twenty-first through thirtieth year of a lease term, subject to the payment of rents by Alexander’s tenants.

We are also entitled to a commission upon the sale of any of Alexander’s assets equal to 3% of gross proceeds, as defined, for asset sales less than $50,000,000, or 1% of gross proceeds, as defined, for asset sales of $50,000,000 or more.  The total of these amounts is payable to us in annual installments in an amount not to exceed $4,000,000 with interest on the unpaid balance at one-year LIBOR plus 1.0%
 (3.02% at December 31, 2009).

Other Agreements

Lexington Realty Trust (“Lexington”) (NYSE: LXP)

Prior to October 28, 2008, we owned 8,149,592 limited partnership units of Lexington Master Limited Partnership which were exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into Lexington common shares, or a 7.7% limited partnership interest.  On October 28, 2008, we acquired 8,000,000 Lexington common shares for $5.60 per share, or $44,800,000.  The purchase price consisted of $22,400,000 in cash and a $22,400,000 margin loan recourse only to the 8,000,000 shares acquired.  In addition, we exchanged our existing limited partnership units in Lexington MLP for 8,149,592 Lexington common shares.  As of December 31, 2009, we own 18,468,969 Lexington common shares, or approximately 15.2% of Lexington’s common equity.  We account for our investment in Lexington on the equity method because we believe we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Lexi
ngton’s operating and financial policies, based on, among other factors, our representation on Lexington’s Board of Trustees and the level of our ownership in Lexington compared to that of other shareholders.  We record our pro rata share of Lexington’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that Lexington files its financial statements.

Based on Lexington’s December 31, 2009 closing share price of $6.08, the market value (“fair value” pursuant to ASC 820) of our investment in Lexington was $112,291,000, or $57,185,000 in excess of the carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet.  During 2009, we recognized $19,121,000 for our share of impairment losses recorded by Lexington related to its investment in Concord Debt Holdings LLC.  During 2008, we concluded that our investment in Lexington was “other-than-temporarily” impaired and recognized an aggregate non-cash impairment loss of $107,882,000.  Our conclusion was based on the deterioration in the capital and financial markets and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near-term.  These losses are included as a component of “(loss) income from partially owned entities,” on our consolidated st
atements of income.

As of December 31, 2009, the carrying amount of our investment in Lexington was less than our share of the equity in the net assets of Lexington by approximately $87,579,000.  This basis difference resulted primarily from the aggregate of $107,882,000 of non-cash impairment losses recognized during 2008.  The remainder of the basis difference related to purchase accounting for our acquisition of an additional 8,000,000 common shares of Lexington in October 2008, of which the majority relates to our estimate of the fair values of Lexington’s real estate (land and buildings) as compared to their carrying amounts in Lexington’s consolidated financial statements.  We are amortizing the basis difference related to the buildings into earnings as additional depreciation expense over their estimated useful lives.  
This depreciation is not material to our share of equity in Lexington’s net income or loss.  The basis difference attributable to the land will be recognized upon disposition of our investment.

GMH

In June 2008, pursuant to the sale of GMH’s military housing division and the merger of its student housing division with American Campus Communities, Inc. (“ACC”) (NYSE: ACC), we received an aggregate of $105,180,000, consisting of $82,142,000 in cash and 753,126 shares of ACC common stock valued at $23,038,000 based on ACC’s then closing share price of $30.59, in exchange for our entire interest in GMH.  We subsequently sold all of the ACC common shares.  The above transactions resulted in a net gain of $2,038,000 which is included as a component of “net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate” in our consolidated statement of income.

Real Estate Joint Ventures’ Development Costs

During 2008, we recognized non-cash losses aggregating $96,037,000, for the write-off of our share of certain partially owned entities’ development costs, as these projects were either deferred or abandoned.  These losses include $37,000,000 for our share of costs in connection with the redevelopment of the Downtown Crossing property in Boston and $23,000,000 for our share of costs in connection with the abandonment of the “arena move”/Moynihan East portions of the Farley project. These losses are included as a component of “(loss) income from partially owned entities,” on our consolidated statement of income.

On July 9, 2009, Toys issued $950 million aggregate principal amount of 10.75% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2017.  The proceeds from the issuance, along with existing cash, were used to repay the outstanding balance under its $1.3 billion senior credit facility, which was subsequently terminated.

(2)

On June 24, 2009, Toys extended this credit facility, which was to expire in July 2010, to May 2012.  The borrowing capacity under the amended facility will remain at $2.0 billion through the original maturity date in July 2010 and will continue at $1.5 billion thereafter.  The interest rate is LIBOR plus 3.20%, which may vary based on availability, through July 2010 and LIBOR plus 4.00%, subject to usage, thereafter.

(3)

This debt was refinanced with the proceeds of a $725 million 8.50% senior secured note offering due 2017.

(4)

On March 10, 2009, the $78,246 outstanding balance of the Rego Park I mortgage loan, which was scheduled to mature in June 2009, was repaid and simultaneously refinanced in the same amount.

4.    Marketable Securities

We classify equity securities that we intend to buy and sell on a short-term basis as trading securities; debt securities and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock investments that we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity as held-to-maturity securities; and debt and equity securities we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time as available-for-sale securities.  Trading securities are presented at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any unrealized gains or losses included in earnings; held-to-maturity securities are presented at amortized cost at the end of each reporting period and unrealized gains and losses are not recognized; and available-for-sale marketable equity securities are presented at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any unrealized gains or losses included as a separate component of equity (i.e., as an 
element of other comprehensive income).  Realized gains and losses on debt and equity securities are recognized in earnings upon the sale of the securities and are recorded based on the weighted average cost of such securities.

We evaluate our portfolio of marketable securities for impairment each reporting period.  For each of the securities in our portfolio with unrealized losses, we review the underlying cause of the decline in value and the estimated recovery period, as well as the severity and duration of the decline.  In our evaluation, we consider our ability and intent to hold these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for us to recover our cost basis.  We also evaluate the near-term prospects for each of these investments in relation to the severity and duration of the decline.

During 2009 and 2008, we concluded that certain of our investments in marketable securities were “other-than-temporarily” impaired and recognized an aggregate of $3,361,000 and $76,352,000, respectively, of non-cash impairment losses.  These charges are included as a component of “interest and other investment (loss) income, net” on our consolidated statements of income.  Our conclusions were based on the severity and duration of the decline in the market value of these securities and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near term.  No impairment losses were recognized in the year ended December 31, 2007.

The carrying amount of marketable securities on consolidated balance sheets and their corresponding fair values at December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as follows:

During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we sold certain of our investments in marketable securities for an aggregate of $64,355,000, $51,185,000, and $112,779,000 in cash, respectively.  In connection therewith, we recognized $3,834,000, $2,028,000 and $39,493,000, respectively, of net gains from the sale of such securities, which are included as a component of “net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate” on our consolidated statements of income.

On January 28, 2010, Equinox pre-paid the entire balance of this loan plus accrued interest.  We received $99,314, including accrued interest, for our 50% interest in the loan which we acquired in 2006 for $57,500.

(2)

On June 16, 2006, we acquired an 81.5% interest in a $95,968 mezzanine loan to Tharaldson Lodging Companies for $78,166 in cash. The loan is secured by a 107 hotel property portfolio with brands including Fairfield Inn, Residence Inn, Comfort Inn and Courtyard by Marriott. The loan is subordinate to $671,778 of debt and is senior to approximately $192,000 of other debt and equity. The loan provides for a 0.75% placement fee and bears interest at LIBOR plus 4.25% (4.47% at December 31, 2009).  The borrower has a one-year extension option.

(3)

In 2005, we made a $135,000 loan to Riley HoldCo Corp., consisting of a $60,000 mezzanine loan and a $75,000 fixed rate unsecured loan. During 2006, we were repaid the $60,000 balance of the mezzanine loan.

(4)

On June 30, 2006, we made a $73,750 mezzanine loan secured by the equity interests in 280 Park Avenue, a 1.2 million square foot office building, located between 48th and 49th Streets in Manhattan. The loan bears interest at 10.25% and matures in June 2016. The loan is subordinate to $1.036 billion of other debt and is senior to approximately $260,000 of equity and interest reserves.

(5)

On June 1, 2009, this loan, which was scheduled to mature in September 2009, was repaid.

(6)

Represents loan loss accruals on certain mezzanine loans based on our estimate of the net realizable value of each loan.  Our estimates are based on the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at each loan’s effective interest rate, or if a loan is collateralized, based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, adjusted for estimated costs to sell.  The excess of the carrying amount over the net realizable value of a loan is recognized as a reduction of “interest and other investment (loss) income, net” in our consolidated statement of income.

In the first quarter of 2009, we purchased $47,000 of the cross collateralized debt secured by our portfolio of 42 strip shopping centers for $46,231 in cash, resulting in a net gain of $769.  On December 11, 2009, we repaid the remaining $393,440 outstanding balance of this debt, which was scheduled to mature in March 2010.

(5)

We continue to evaluate plans to renovate and reposition the Springfield mall; given current economic conditions, that may require us to renegotiate the terms of the existing debt and, accordingly, we have requested that the debt be placed with the special servicer.

(12)

On August 20, 2009, the fixed interest rate swap on this loan expired and the loan was reclassified from fixed rate to variable rate debt.  In addition, on October 15, 2009, we refinanced the principal amount of this loan at LIBOR plus 3.75% (3.99% at December 31, 2009).  The loan has an initial maturity of November 2011, with a one-year extension option.

(13)

In connectio
n with these purchases, we recognized an aggregate net loss of $29,269 in 2009 and an aggregate net gain of $9,820 in 2008 which is reflected as a component of “net (loss) gain on early extinguishment of debt” on our consolidated statements of income.

(15)

On September 30, 2009, we completed a public offering of $460,000 principal amount of 7.875% callable senior unsecured 30-year notes due October 1, 2039.  Interest on the notes is payable quarterly in arrears on each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, commencing January 1, 2010.  The notes were sold to the public at par and may be redeemed at our option in whole or in part beginning October 1, 2014, at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.  These notes contain financial covenants, including limitations on outstanding debt and 
minimum interest and fixed charge coverage ratios.  We retained net proceeds of approximately $446,000 from the offering which were used for general corporate purposes.

Pursuant to the provisions of ASC 470-20, we are required to disclose the conversion price and the number of shares on which the aggregate consideration to be delivered upon conversion is determined (principal plus excess value).  Our convertible senior debentures require that upon conversion, the entire principal amount is to be settled in cash, and at our option, any excess value above the principal amount may be settled in cash or common shares.  Based on the December 31, 2009 closing share price of our common shares and the conversion prices in the table above, there was no excess val
ue; accordingly, no common shares would be issued if these securities were settled on this date.  The number of common shares on which the aggregate consideration to be delivered upon conversion is 143 and 2,946 common shares, respectively.

8.    Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Redeemable noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheets represent Operating Partnership units held by third-parties and are comprised of (i) Class A units, (ii) Series B convertible preferred units, and (iii) Series D-10, D-11, D-12, D-14 and D-15 (collectively, “Series D”) cumulative redeemable preferred units.  Class A units of the Operating Partnership may be tendered for redemption to the Operating Partnership for cash; we, at our option, may assume that obligation and pay the holder either cash or Vornado common shares on a one-for-one basis.  Because the number of Vornado common shares outstanding at all times equals the number of Class A units owned by Vornado, the redemption value of each Class A unit is equivalent to the market value of one Vornado common share, and the quarterly distribution to a Class A unitholder is equal to th
e quarterly dividend paid to a Vornado common shareholder.  Below are the details of Operating Partnership units held by third-parties that are included in “redeemable noncontrolling interests” as of December 31, 2009 and 2008:

10.  Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures

defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value.  The objective of fair value is to determine the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price).

ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels: Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at 
the measurement date for assets or liabilities; Level 2 – observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3 – unobservable inputs that are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value.  Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret Level 2 and 3 inputs in determining fair value of our financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.  Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the fair values we present herein are indicative of amounts that may ultimately be realized upon sale or other disposition of these assets.

Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis

Financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in our consolidated financial statements consist primarily of (i) marketable equity securities, (ii) the assets of our deferred compensation plan, which are primarily marketable equity securities and equity investments in limited partnerships, (iii) short-term investments (CDARS classified as available-for-sale) and (iv) mandatorily redeemable instruments (Series G convertible preferred units and Series D-13 cumulative redeemable preferred units).  The tables below aggregate the fair values of financial assets and liabilities by the levels in the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

10.  Fair Value Measurements - continued

Fair Value Measurements on a Nonrecurring Basis

Non-financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in our consolidated financial statements consist of real estate assets and investments in partially owned entities that have been written-down to estimated fair value during 2009.  See Note 2 –

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

for details of impairment losses recognized during 2009.  The fair values of these assets are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including (i) discounted cash flow analysis, which considers, among other things, leasing assumptions, growth rates, discount rates and terminal capitalization rates, (ii) income capitalization approach, which considers prevailing market capitalization 
rates and (iii) comparable sales activity.  In general, we consider multiple valuation techniques when measuring fair values.  However, in certain circumstances, a single valuation technique may be appropriate.  The table below aggregates the fair values of these assets by the levels in the fair value hierarchy.

11.  Discontinued Operations

In accordance with the provisions of ASC 360,

Property, Plant, and Equipment

, we have reclassified the revenues and expenses of properties and businesses sold or held for sale to “income from discontinued operations” and the related assets and liabilities to “assets related to discontinued operations” and “liabilities related to discontinued operations” for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  The net gains resulting from the sale of the properties below are included in “income from discontinued operations” on our consolidated statements of income.

On September 1, 2009, we sold 1999 K Street, a newly developed 250,000 square foot office building, in Washington’s Central Business District, for $207,800,000 in cash which resulted in a net gain of approximately $41,211,000.

During 2009, we sold 15 retail properties in separate transactions for an aggregate of $55,000,000 in cash which resulted in net gains aggregating $4,073,000.

On March 31, 2008, we sold our 47.6% interest in Americold, our Temperature Controlled Logistics segment for $220,000,000 in cash which resulted in a net gain of $112,690,000.

On June 10, 2008, we sold our Tysons Dulles Plaza office building complex for $152,800,000 in cash which resulted in a net gain of $56,831,000.

On July 16, 2007, we sold our Vineland, New Jersey shopping center property for $2,774,000 in cash which resulted in a net gain of $1,708,000.

On August 9, 2007, we sold Crystal Mall Two, a 277,000 square foot office building located at 1801 South Bell Street in Crystal City for $103,600,000 which resulted in a net gain of $19,893,000.  All of the proceeds from the sale have been reinvested in tax-free “like-kind” exchange investments in accordance with Section 1031.

On October 17, 2007, we sold Arlington Plaza, a 188,000 square foot office building located in Arlington, Virginia for $71,500,000 in cash which resulted in a net gain of $33,900,000.

During the fourth quarter of 2009, we reclassified an 8.6 acre parcel of land out of “assets related to discontinued operations” since it no longer met such criteria, as the buyer terminated the sales contract.  The tables below set forth the assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and their combined results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

12.  Stock-based Compensation

Our Share Option Plan (the “Plan”) provides for grants of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted Operating Partnership units and out-performance plan awards.  We have approximately 4,854,000 shares available for future grant under the Plan at December 31, 2009.

During the first quarter of 2009, our nine most senior executives voluntarily surrendered their 2008 out-performance plan awards and their 2007 and 2008 stock option awards.  Accordingly, we recognized $32,588,000 of expense, representing the unamortized portion of these awards, which is included in “general and administrative expenses” on our consolidated statement of income.  As a result of these surrenders, stock-based compensation expense will be approximately $9,400,000, $9,400,000, $5,700,000 and $1,000,000 lower in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

Out-Performance Plans

On March 31, 2008, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Trustees approved a $75,000,000 out-performance plan (the “2008 OPP”).  Under the 2008 OPP, the total return to our shareholders (the “Total Return”) resulting from both share appreciation and dividends for the four-year period from March 31, 2008 to March 31, 2012 must exceed both an absolute and a relative hurdle.  The initial value from which to determine the Total Return is $86.20 per share, a 0.93% premium to the trailing 10-day average closing price on the New York Stock Exchange for our common shares on the date the plan was adopted.  During the four-year performance period, participants are entitled to receive 10% of the common dividends paid on Vornado’s common shares for each 2008 OPP unit awarded, regardless of whether the units are ultimately earned.  The f
air value of the 2008 OPP awards on the date of grant, as adjusted for estimated forfeitures, was approximately $21,600,000, and is being amortized into expense over a five-year period beginning on the date of grant through the final vesting period, using a graded vesting attribution model, with the exception of an aggregate of $13,722,000 which was accelerated into expense in the first quarter of 2009 as a result of the voluntary surrender of such awards discussed above.

On April 25, 2006, our Compensation Committee approved a $100,000,000 Out-performance plan (the “2006 OPP”), under which 91% of the total Out-Performance Plan was awarded.  The fair value of the awards on the date of grant, as adjusted for estimated forfeitures, was approximately $46,141,000 and is being amortized into expense over the five-year vesting period beginning on the date of grant, using a graded vesting attribution model.   As of January 12, 2007, the maximum performance threshold under the Out-Performance Plan was achieved, concluding the performance period.

During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized $23,493,000, $16,021,000 and $12,734,000 of compensation expense, respectively, for these plans.  As of December 31, 2009, there was $6,318,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related these plans, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.37 years.  Distributions paid on unvested OPP Units are charged to “net income attributable to noncontrolling interests” on our consolidated statements of income and amounted to $1,935,000, $2,918,000 and $2,694,000 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to 100% of the average of the high and low market price of our common shares on the NYSE on the date of grant, generally vest pro-rata over five years and expire 10 years from the date of grant.  Compensation expense related to stock option awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with the exception of an aggregate of $18,873,000 which was accelerated into expense in the first quarter of 2009 as a result of voluntary surrenders as previously discussed.  During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recognized $25,911,000, $9,051,000 and $4,549,000, of compensation expense, respectively, for these options.  As of December 31, 2009 there was $8,838,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over 
a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.

As lessor:

We lease space to tenants under operating leases. Most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base rentals payable monthly in advance. Office building leases generally require the tenants to reimburse us for operating costs and real estate taxes above their base year costs. Shopping center leases provide for the pass‑through to tenants the tenants’ share of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance. Shopping center leases also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ sales. As of December 31, 2009, future base rental revenue under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding rents for leases with an original term of less than one year and rents resulting from the exercise of renewal options, is as follows:

These amounts do not include rentals based on tenants’ sales. These percentage rents approximated $9,051,000, $7,322,000, and $9,379,000, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

17.  Leases - continued

Former Bradlees Locations

Pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, dated May 1, 1992, we are due $5,000,000 per annum of additional rent from Stop & Shop which was allocated to certain of Bradlees former locations. On December 31, 2002, prior to the expiration of the leases to which the additional rent was allocated, we reallocated this rent to other former Bradlees leases also guaranteed by Stop & Shop. Stop & Shop is contesting our right to reallocate and claims that we are no longer entitled to the additional rent. At December 31, 2009, we were due an aggregate of $35,417,000. We believe the additional rent provision of the guaranty expires, at the earliest, in 2012 and we are vigorously contesting Stop & Shop’s position.

As lessee:

We are a tenant under operating leases for certain properties. These leases have terms that expire during the next thirty years. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases at December 31, 2009, are as follows:

We are also a lessee under capital leases for real estate. Lease terms generally range from 5-20 years with renewal or purchase options. Capitalized leases are recorded at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the property. Capitalized leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset or life of the related lease, whichever is shorter. Amortization expense on capital leases is included in “depreciation and amortization” on our consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2009, future minimum lease payments under capital leases are as follows:

18.  Commitments and Contingencies

Insurance

We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, including coverage for terrorist acts, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods.  Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $150,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, and a $150,000,000 annual aggregate.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by TRIPRA.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC.  Our coverage for NBCR losses is up to $2 billion per occurrence, for which PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and 15% of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of a covered loss.  We are ultimately responsible for any loss borne by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance and/or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us.  However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space.  These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans.  As of December 31, 2009, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $135,000,000.

At December 31, 2009, $37,232,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under our $0

.

965 billion revolving credit facility.  Our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

We are committed to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $90,406,000. Of this amount, $71,788,000 is committed to IPF and is pledged as collateral to IPF’s lender.

Litigation

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including the matters referred to below, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (“USDC-NJ”) claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that a prior order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York dated February 6, 2001, as modified on appeal to the District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 13, 2001, froze our right to reallocate which effectively terminated our right to collect the additional rent from Stop & Shop. On March 3, 2003, 
after we moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Stop & Shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint. On March 26, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a new complaint in New York State Supreme Court, asserting substantially the same claims as in its USDC-NJ complaint. We removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In January 2005 that court remanded the action to the New York State Supreme Court. On February 14, 2005, we served an answer in which we asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the mo
tions for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Court’s decision and on December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Court’s decision.  On January 16, 2007, we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Court’s decision which was denied on March 13, 2007.  Discovery is now complete.  On October 19, 2009, Stop & Shop filed a motion for leave to amend its pleadings to assert new claims for relief, including a claim for damages in an unspecified amount, and an additional affirmative defense.  The motion was argued and submitted for decision on December 18, 2009.  The course of future proceedings will depend upon the outcome of Stop & Shop’s motion, but we anticipate that a trial date will be set for some time in 2010.  We intend to vigorously pursue our claims against Stop & Shop.  In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a
 material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

On May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas and the 555 California Street complex.  Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties.  The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump.  In August 2005, Mr. Trump brought a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court against, among others, the general partners of the partnerships referred to above relating to a dispute over the sale of properties located on the former Penn Central rail yards between West 59th and 72nd Streets in Manhattan which were formerly owned by the partnerships.  In decisions iss
ued in 2006, 2007 and 2009, the New York State Supreme Court dismissed all of Mr. Trump’s claims, and those decisions were affirmed by the Appellate Division.  Mr. Trump cannot further appeal those decisions.

In July 2005, we acquired H Street Building Corporation (“H Street”) which has a subsidiary that owns, among other things, a 50% tenancy in common interest in land located in Arlington County, Virginia, known as "Pentagon Row," leased to two tenants.  In April 2007, H Street acquired the remaining 50% interest in that fee.  In April 2007, we received letters from those tenants, Street Retail, Inc. and Post Apartment Homes, L.P., claiming they had a right of first offer triggered by each of those transactions. On September 25, 2008, both tenants filed suit against us and the former owners.  The claim alleges the right to purchase the fee interest, damages in excess of $75,000,000 and punitive damages.  We believe this claim is without merit and regardless of merit, in our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, this c
laim will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

19.  Related Party Transactions

Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees

Alexander’s

We own 32.4% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President and Chief Executive Officer, are officers and directors of Alexander’s.  We provide various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements.  These agreements are described in Note 3 - Investments in Partially Owned Entities.

On March 2, 2009, Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli each exercised 150,000 stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) which were scheduled to expire on March 4, 2009 and each received gross proceeds of $11,419,000.

On September 9, 2008, Alexander’s Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $7.00 per share, payable on October 30, 2008, to shareholders of record on October 14, 2008.  The dividend was attributable to the liquidation of the wholly owned 731 Lexington Avenue taxable REIT subsidiary into Alexander’s.  Accordingly, on October 30, we received $11,578,000, which was accounted for as a reduction of our investment in Alexander’s.

On September 15, 2008 and October 14, 2008, Mr. Roth exercised an aggregate of 200,000 SARs which were scheduled to expire on March 4, 2009 and received gross proceeds of $62,809,000.

Interstate Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr. Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s, are Interstate’s two other partners. As of December 31, 2009, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned approximately 7.3% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 27.2% of Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days’ notice at the end of the term. We believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies, that the management agreement terms are fair to us. We earned $782,000, $803,000 and $800,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

20.  Retirement Plans

Prior to December 2008, we had two defined benefit pension plans, a Vornado Realty Trust Retirement Plan (“Vornado Plan”) and a Merchandise Mart Properties Pension Plan (“Mart Plan”). The benefits under the Vornado Plan and the Mart Plan (collectively, the “Plans”) were frozen in December 1997 and June 1999, respectively. Benefits under the Plans were primarily based on years of service and compensation during employment or on years of credited service and established monthly benefits. Funding policy for the Plans was based on contributions at the minimum amounts required by law.  During the first quarter of 2009, we finalized the termination of the Mart Plan, which resulted in a $2,800,000 pension settlement expense.  During the fourth quarter of 2008, we finalized the termination of the Vornado Plan which resulted in a $4,600,000 pe
nsion settlement expense.  These charges are included as a component of “general and administrative” expense on our consolidated statements of income.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

22.  Segment Information - continued

Notes to the preceding tabular information:

(1)

EBITDA represents “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.”  We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flows and may not be comparable
 to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)

Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax (benefit) expense in the reconciliation of net income to EBITDA include our share of these items from partially owned entities.

item 9.                  changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure

None.

Item 9A.                Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures:  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a‑15 (e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:  There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of Vornado Realty Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As of December 31, 2009, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 was effective.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our trustees; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 165, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board of Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Vornado Realty Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of trustees, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation o
f financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2009 and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in equity, and cash flows for the year then ended of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.
