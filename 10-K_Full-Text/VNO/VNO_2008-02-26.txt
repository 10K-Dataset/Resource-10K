OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through:

•

Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

•

Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;

•

Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

•

Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;

•

Investing in fully-integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate component;

•

Developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and

•

Providing specialty financing to real estate related companies.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets.

ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS

During 2007, we completed $4,045,400,000 of real estate acquisitions and investments in 33 separate transactions, consisting of an aggregate of $3,024,600,000 in cash, $958,700,000 in existing mortgage debt and $62,100,000 in common or preferred Operating Partnership units.  Details of the significant transactions are summarized below.

100 West 33

rd

Street, New York City (the “Manhattan Mall”)

On January 10, 2007, we acquired the Manhattan Mall for approximately $689,000,000 in cash.  This mixed-use property is located on the entire Sixth Avenue block-front between 32

nd

and 33

rd

Streets in Manhattan and contains approximately 1,000,000 square feet, including 845,000 square feet of office space and 164,000 square feet of retail space. Included as part of the acquisition were 250,000 square feet of additional air rights.  The property is adjacent to our Hotel Pennsylvania.

Bruckner Plaza, Bronx, New York

On January 11, 2007, we acquired the Bruckner Plaza shopping center, containing 386,000 square feet, for approximately $165,000,000 in cash.  Also included as part of the acquisition was an adjacent parcel which is ground leased to a third party.  The property is located on Bruckner Boulevard in the Bronx, New York.

Filene’s, Boston, Massachusetts

On January 26, 2007, a joint venture in which we have a 50% interest, acquired the Filene’s property located in the Downtown Crossing district of Boston, Massachusetts for approximately $100,000,000 in cash, of which our share was $50,000,000.  The venture plans to redevelop the property to include approximately 1,400,000 square feet, consisting of office, retail and condominium apartments.


ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS - CONTINUED

H Street Building Corporation (“H Street”)

In
    July 2005, we acquired H Street, which owns a 50% interest
    in real estate assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia
    and Washington, DC. On April 30, 2007, we acquired the corporations
    that own the remaining 50% interest in these assets for approximately
    $383,000,000, consisting of $322,000,000 in cash and $61,000,000
    of existing mortgages. These assets include twin office buildings
    located in Washington, DC, containing 577,000 square feet,
    and assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia, comprised
    of 34 acres of land leased to three residential and retail
    operators, a 1,680 unit high-rise apartment complex and 10
    acres of vacant land. In conjunction with this acquisition
all existing litigation was dismissed.

Further, we agreed to sell approximately 19.6 of the 34 acres of land to one of the existing ground lessees in two closings over a two-year period for approximately $220,000,000.  On May 11, 2007, we closed on the sale of 11 of the 19.6 acres for $104,000,000 and received $5,000,000 in cash and a $99,000,000 note due December 31, 2007.  On September 28, 2007, the buyer pre-paid the note in cash and we recognized a net gain on sale of $4,803,000.  In April 2007, we received letters from the two remaining ground lessees claiming a right of first offer on the sale of the land, one of which has since retracted its letter and reserved its rights under the lease.

In connection with purchase accounting, in July 2005 and April 2007 we recorded an aggregate of $220,000,000 of deferred tax liabilities for the differences between the tax basis and the book basis of the acquired assets and liabilities.  We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of February 2008, we have completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008.  Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, the deferred tax liabilities will be eliminated and we will recognize $220,000,000 as an income tax benefit on our consolidated statement of income.

Our
    total purchase price for 100% of the assets we will own,
    after the anticipated proceeds from the land sales, is $409,000,000,
    consisting of $286,000,000 in cash and $123,000,000 of existing
mortgages.

1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street

On May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas, a 2,000,000 square foot Manhattan office building located on the block-front between 51

st

and 52

nd

Street on Avenue of the Americas, and the three- building 555 California Street complex (“555 California Street”) containing 1,800,000 square feet, known as the Bank of America Center, located at California and Montgomery Streets in San Francisco’s financial district.  The purchase price for our 70% interest in the real estate was approximately $1.8 billion, consisting of $1.0 billion of cash and $797,000,000 of existing debt.  Our share of the debt is comprised of $308,000,000 secured by 1290 Avenue of the Americas and $489,000,000 secured by 555 California Street.  Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies
that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties.  The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump.

In August 2005, Mr. Trump brought a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court against, among others, the general partners of the partnerships referred to above.   Mr. Trump’s claims arose out of a dispute over the sale price of, and use of proceeds from, the sale of properties located on the former Penn Central rail yards between West 59th and 72nd Streets in Manhattan which were formerly owned by the partnerships.  In decisions dated September 14, 2005 and July 24, 2006, the Court denied various of Mr. Trump’s motions and ultimately dismissed all of Mr. Trump’s claims, except for his claim seeking access to books and records.   In a decision dated October 1, 2007, the Court determined that Mr. Trump had already received access to the books and records to which he was entitled, with the exception of certain documents which were
subsequently delivered to Mr. Trump.  Mr. Trump has sought re-argument and renewal on, and filed a notice of appeal in connection with, his dismissed claims.

In connection with the acquisition, we agreed to indemnify the sellers for liabilities and expenses arising out of Mr. Trump’s claim that the general partners of the partnerships we acquired did not sell the rail yards at a fair price or could have sold the rail yards for a greater price and any other claims asserted in the legal action; provided however, that if Mr. Trump prevails on certain claims involving partnership matters, other than claims relating to sale price, the sellers will be required to reimburse us for certain costs related to those claims.  We believe that the claims relating to the sale price are without merit.  All other allegations are not asserted as a basis for damages and regardless of merit would not be material to our consolidated financial statements.


ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS - CONTINUED

India Property Fund L.P.

On June 14, 2007, we committed to contribute $95,000,000 to the India Property Fund, L.P. (the “Fund”), established to acquire, manage and develop real estate in India.  In addition, we sold our interest in another India real estate partnership to the Fund for $77,000,000 and deferred the $3,700,000 net gain on sale.  On December 20, 2007, we increased our commitment to the Fund by $20,000,000.  As of December 31, 2007, the Fund has equity commitments aggregating $227,500,000, of which our $115,000,000 commitment represents 50.6%.  In January 2008, the Fund completed capital calls aggregating $50,400,000, of which our share was $25,500,000.

Shopping Center Portfolio Acquisition

On
    June 26, 2007, we entered into an agreement to acquire a
    portfolio of 15 shopping centers aggregating approximately
    1.9 million square feet for an aggregate purchase price of
    $351,000,000. The properties are located primarily in Northern
    New Jersey and Long Island, New York. We have completed the
    acquisition of nine of these properties for an aggregate
    purchase price of $250,478,000 consisting of $109,279,000
    in cash, $49,599,000 in Vornado Realty L.P. preferred units,
    $12,460,000 of Vornado Realty L.P. common units and $79,140,000
    of existing mortgage debt. We have determined not to complete
    the acquisition of the remaining six properties and have
    expensed $2,700,000 for costs of acquisitions not consummated
    on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

BNA Complex

On August 9, 2007, we acquired a three building complex from The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. (“BNA”) for $111,000,000 in cash.  The complex contains approximately 300,000 square feet and is located in Washington’s West End between Georgetown and the Central Business District.  We plan to convert two of these buildings to rental apartments.  Simultaneously with the acquisition, we sold Crystal Mall Two, a 277,000 square foot office building located at 1801 South Bell Street in Crystal City, to BNA for $103,600,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $19,893,000.

INVESTMENTS IN MEZZANINE LOANS

At
    December 31, 2007, the carrying amount of our investments
    in mezzanine loans aggregated $492,339,000, net of a $57,000,000
    allowance described below. Substantially all of these investments
    are loans to companies that have significant real estate
    assets. Mezzanine loans are generally subordinate to first
    mortgage loans and are secured by pledges of equity interests
    of the entities owning the underlying real estate. During
    2007 we were repaid principal amounts aggregating $241,000,000
    and we made new investments aggregating $217,000,000. As
    of December 31, 2007, these investments have a weighted average
interest rate of 9.7%.

On
    June 5, 2007, we acquired a 42% interest in two MPH mezzanine
    loans totaling $158,700,000, for $66,000,000 in cash. The
    loans, which were due on February 8, 2008 and have not been
    repaid, are subordinate to $2.9 billion of mortgage and other
    debt and secured by the equity interests in four New York
    City properties: Worldwide Plaza, 1540 Broadway office condominium,
    527 Madison Avenue and Tower 56. We have reduced the net
    carrying amount of the loans to $9,000,000, by recognizing
    a $57,000,000 non-cash charge which is included as a reduction
    of “interest
    and other investment income” on our consolidated statement
    of income for the year ended December 31, 2007.


OTHER INVESTMENTS

GMH Communities L.P. (“GMH”)

At December 31, 2007, we own 7,337,857 GMH Communities L.P. (“GMH”) limited partnership units, which are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common shares of GMH Communities Trust (NYSE: GCT) (“GCT”), and 2,517,247 common shares of GCT, or 13.8% of the limited partnership interest of GMH.   GMH is a self-advised, self-managed, specialty housing company that focuses on providing housing to college and university students residing off-campus and to members of the U.S. military and their families located on or near military bases throughout the United States.

On February 12, 2008, GCT announced that it has entered into two definitive agreements in connection with the sale of its military and student housing divisions for an aggregate sales price of approximately $9.61 per share/unit.   In addition, GCT anticipates selling its remaining assets prior to the closing of the merger.  The merger, which has been unanimously approved by GCT’s Board of Trustees, is subject to GCT shareholder approval and customary closing conditions.

As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of our investment in GMH and GCT based on GCT’s December 31, 2007 closing share price of $5.52, was $54,400,000, or $48,860,000 below the carrying amount of $10.48 per share/unit on our consolidated balance sheet.  We have concluded that as of December 31, 2007, the decline in the value of our investment is not “other-than-temporary,” based on the aggregate value anticipated to be received as a result of the transactions described above, including the additional consideration from the sale of GCT’s remaining assets.

DISPOSITIONS

Investment in McDonald’s Corporation (“McDonalds”) (NYSE: MCD)

In July 2005 we acquired 858,000 McDonalds’ common shares at a weighted average price of $29.54 per share.  These shares were classified as “available-for-sale” marketable equity securities on our consolidated balance sheet and the fluctuations in the market value of these shares during the period of our ownership was recorded as “other comprehensive income” in the shareholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheet.  During October 2007, we sold all of these shares at a weighted average price of $56.45 per share and recognized a net gain of $23,090,000, representing accumulated appreciation during the period of our ownership.

During the second half of 2005, we acquired an economic interest in an additional 14,565,500 McDonalds’ common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which we purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on McDonalds’ common shares. These call and put options had an initial weighted-average strike price of $32.66 per share, or an aggregate of $475,692,000 and provided for net cash settlement. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increased at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and was decreased for dividends received. The options provided us with the same economic gain or loss as if we had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate purchase price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options
were derivatives and did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period were recognized as “investment income or loss” on our consolidated statements of income.  In 2006, we sold 2,119,500 of these shares at a weighted average price of $35.49 per share, and acquired an additional 1,250,000 option shares at a weighted average price of $33.08 per share. As of December 31, 2006, there were 13,695,500 option shares in the derivative position with an adjusted weighted average strike price of $32.70 per share.  During August, September and October 2007, we settled the 13,695,500 option shares and received an aggregate of $260,719,000 in cash.  During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized net gains of $108,821,000, $138,815,000 and $17,254,000, respectively, representing income from the mark-to-market of these shares during the period of our ownership
through their settlement, net of related LIBOR charges.

The aggregate net gain from inception of our investments in McDonalds in 2005 through final settlement in October 2007 was $289,414,000.

Property Sales

During 2007, we sold three properties (Crystal Mall Two, Arlington Plaza and the Vineland, New Jersey shopping center property) in three separate transactions for an aggregate sales price of $177,874,000 in cash, which resulted in an aggregate net gain of $55,501,000.


DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

We are currently engaged in various development/redevelopment projects for which we have budgeted approximately $1.977 billion. Of this amount, $214.9 million was expended prior to 2007, $401.6 million was expended in 2007 and $719.6 million is estimated to be expended in 2008. Below is a description of these projects.

DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS - CONTINUED

On July 19, 2005 a joint venture in which we have a 50% interest entered into a Memorandum of Understanding and has been designated as the developer to convert the Farley Post Office in Manhattan, which occupies the super block between 31

st

and 33

rd

Streets from 8

th

to 9

th

Avenues, into the Moynihan Train Station.  The plans for the Moynihan Train Station project include 300,000 square feet for a new transportation facility to be financed with public funding, as well as 850,000 square feet of commercial space and up to 1.0 million square feet of air rights intended to be transferred to an adjacent site.  The venture endeavors to expand the plans to incorporate the adjacent super block to the east, relocating Madison Square Garden from its present site above Penn Station to the west end of the Farley Complex, permitting it to develop 5.5 million
square feet of mixed use space on the old Madison Square Garden site and incorporate our existing 1.5 million square foot Two Penn Plaza into a 7.0 million square foot complex.  In March 2007, New York’s Empire State Development Corporation (the “ESDC”) acquired the Farley building from the United States Postal Service.  In October 2007, the ESDC issued a Draft Scope of Work in connection with the preparation of a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement describing the expanded development plan and proposing a zoning sub-district which would enable the venture to transfer the air rights under the original plans or the expanded plans to other locations within the Penn Plaza area.  In addition, the Draft Scope of Work describes the public approvals and public actions necessary to implement either the original or expanded plans.

On December 4, 2007 a joint venture in which we are the 80% controlling and development partner was selected as the developer of the north wing of the Port Authority Bus Terminal at 42

nd

Street and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. The joint venture intends to enter into a 99 year lease with the Port Authority to create approximately 60,000 square feet of retail space and develop a 1.3 million square foot office tower. The Port Authority also intends to renovate and modernize the bus terminal. The parties are also discussing the redevelopment of the south wing of the terminal.

We are evaluating other development opportunities, for which final plans and budgeted costs have yet to be determined,  including: (i) redevelopment plans for the Hotel Pennsylvania, (ii) redeveloping certain shopping malls, including the Green Acres and Springfield Malls, (iii) redeveloping and expanding retail space and signage in the Penn Plaza area, (iv) conversion of 220 Central Park South, a residential apartment building, to condominiums and (v) other projects.

There can be no assurance that any of our development projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed on schedule or within budget.


FINANCING ACTIVITIES

On March 21, 2007, we sold $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.85% convertible senior debentures due 2027, pursuant to an effective registration statement.  The aggregate net proceeds from this offering, after underwriters’ discounts and expenses, were approximately $1.37 billion.  The debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in 2012 for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures in 2012, 2017, and 2022 and in certain other limited circumstances.  The debentures are convertible, under certain circumstances, for cash and Vornado common shares at an initial conversion rate of 6.1553 common shares per $1,000 of principal amount of debentures.  The initial conversion price was $162.46, which represented a premium of 30% over the March 21, 2007 closing price for our common
shares. The principal amount of debentures will be settled for cash and the amount in excess of the principal defined as the conversion value will be settled in cash or, at our election, Vornado common shares.

On September 28, 2007, the Operating Partnership entered into a new $1.510 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which was increased by $85,000,000 on October 12, 2007 and can be increased to up to $2.0 billion during the initial term.  The new facility has a three-year term with two one-year extension options, bears interest at LIBOR plus 55 basis points (5.43% at December 31, 2007), based on our current credit ratings and requires the payment of an annual facility fee of 15 basis points.  Together with the existing $1.0 billion credit facility, the Operating Partnership has an aggregate of $2.595 billion of unsecured revolving credit.  Vornado is the guarantor of the Operating Partnership’s obligations under both revolving credit agreements.  The existing $1.0 billion credit facility’s financial covenants have been modified to conform to the financial covenants
under the new agreement.  Significant modifications include (i) changing the definition of Capitalization Value to exclude corporate unallocated general and administrative expenses and to reduce the capitalization rate to 6.5% from 7.5%, and (ii) changing the definition of Total Outstanding Indebtedness to exclude indebtedness of unconsolidated joint ventures.  Under the new agreement, “Equity Value” may not be less than Three Billion Dollars; “Total Outstanding Indebtedness” may not exceed sixty percent (60%) of “Capitalization Value;” the ratio of “Combined EBITDA” to “Fixed Charges,” each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not be less than 1.40 to 1.00; the ratio of “Unencumbered Combined EBITDA” to “Unsecured Interest Expense,” each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not be less than 1.50 to 1.00; at any time, “Unsecured Indebtedness” may not exceed
sixty percent (60%) of “Capitalization Value of Unencumbered Assets;” and the ratio of “Secured Indebtedness” to “Capitalization Value,” each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not exceed fifty percent (50%).  The new agreement also contains standard representations and warranties and other covenants.  The terms in quotations in this paragraph are all defined in the new agreement, which was filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 28, 2007, filed on October 4, 2007.

In addition to the above, during 2007 we completed approximately $1.111 billion of property level financings and repaid approximately $412,674,000 of existing debt with a portion of the proceeds.

The net proceeds we received from the above financings were used primarily to fund acquisitions and investments and for other general corporate purposes.  We may seek to obtain additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings or asset sales, although there is no express policy with respect these capital markets transactions. We may also offer our shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise re-acquire our shares or any other securities in the future.


SEASONALITY

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarter-by-quarter net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations. The business of Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”) is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys’ fourth quarter net income, which we record on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of Toys’ fiscal year net income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the third quarter of the year. The Merchandise Mart segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage rental income. The Temperature Controlled Logistics segment has experienced higher
earnings in the fourth quarter due to higher activity and occupancy in warehouse operations due to the holiday season’s impact on the food industry.

TENANTS ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 10% OF REVENUES

None of our tenants represented more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

CERTAIN ACTIVITIES

We are not required to base our acquisitions and investments on specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for long-term investment; however, it is possible that properties in the portfolio may be sold in whole or in part, as circumstances warrant, from time to time. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property. While we may seek the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by our Board of Trustees without the vote of shareholders.

EMPLOYEES

As
    of December 31, 2007, we have approximately 4,020 employees,
    of which 311 are corporate staff. The New York Office Properties
    segment has 128 employees and an additional 2,021 employees
    of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary.
    The Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties and
    Merchandise Mart Properties segments have 232, 200 and 559
    employees, respectively, and the Hotel Pennsylvania has 569
    employees. The forgoing does not include employees of partially
    owned entities, including Americold Realty Trust, Toys or
Alexander’s, in which we own 47.6%, 32.7% and 32.8%, respectively.

SEGMENT DATA

We operate in the following business segments: New York Office Properties, Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties, Merchandise Mart Properties, Temperature Controlled Logistics and Toys. Financial information related to our business segments for the years 2007, 2006 and 2005 is set forth in Note 20 – Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.  The Merchandise Mart Properties segment has trade show operations in Canada and Switzerland. The Temperature Controlled Logistics segment manages one warehouse in Canada. The Toys segment operates in 505 locations internationally. In addition, we have one partially owned consolidated investment and three partially owned nonconsolidated investments in real estate partnerships located in India, which are included in the Other segment.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Material factors that may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition are summarized below.

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS' VALUE AND INCOME FLUCTUATE DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS.

The value of real estate fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business. These conditions may also limit our revenues and available cash.

The factors that affect the value of our real estate investments include, among other things:

•

national, regional and local economic conditions;

•

consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the United States;

•

our ability to secure adequate insurance;

•

local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area;

•

competition from other available space;

•

whether tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property attractive;

•

the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;

•

whether we are able to pass some or all of any increased operating costs through to tenants;

•

how well we manage our properties;

•

fluctuations in interest rates;

•

changes in real estate taxes and other expenses;

•

changes in market rental rates;

•

the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;

•

changes in taxation or zoning laws;

•

government regulation;

•

availability of financing on acceptable terms or at all;

•

potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations; and

•

general competitive factors.

The rents we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors. If our rental revenues and/or occupancy levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and distribute to our shareholders. In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, generally do not decline when the related rents decline.

Real estate is a competitive business.

Our business segments – Office, Retail, Merchandise Mart Properties, Temperature Controlled Logistics, Toys “R” Us and Other – operate in highly competitive environments. We have a large concentration of properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC and Northern Virginia areas. We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rent charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and breadth and quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes,
governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.


We depend on leasing space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from tenants who may not be able to pay.

Our financial results depend significantly on leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms. In addition, because a substantial majority of our income comes from renting of real property, our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and funds available for distribution to our shareholders will decrease if a significant number of our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain our levels of occupancy on favorable terms. If a tenant does not pay its rent, we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and might incur substantial legal costs.

Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Although inflation has not materially impacted our operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a pronounced negative impact on our mortgage and debt interest and general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents.  Inflation could also have an adverse effect on consumer spending which could impact our tenants’ sales and, in turn, our percentage rents, where applicable.

Bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenues and available cash.

From time to time, some of our tenants have declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the future. If a major tenant declares bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, the rental property at which it leases space may have lower revenues and operational difficulties. In the case of our shopping centers, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could cause us to have difficulty leasing the remainder of the affected property. Our leases generally do not contain restrictions designed to ensure the creditworthiness of our tenants. As a result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could result in a lower level of net income and funds available for the payment of our indebtedness or for distribution to our shareholders.

We may incur costs to comply with environmental laws.

Our operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may impair our ability to sell or lease real
estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and underground storage tanks are also regulated by federal and state laws. We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or tanks or related
claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure at or from our properties.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment. The environmental assessments did not, as of this date, reveal any environmental condition material to our business. However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, discovery of additional sites, human exposure to the contamination or changes in cleanup or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us.


Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.

We carry commercial liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) “acts of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (“TRIPRA”), which expires in December 2014, and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to our assets. Our New York Office, Washington, DC Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart divisions have $1.5 billion of per occurrence all risk property insurance coverage, including terrorism coverage, in effect through September 15, 2008.  AmeriCold has $250,000,000 of per occurrence all risk property insurance coverage, including terrorism coverage, in effect through January 1, 2009.   Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $150,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, and a
$150,000,000 annual aggregate limit.

In June 2007 we formed Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, to act as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage and as a direct insurer for coverage for “certified” acts of terrorism and for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by TRIPRA.  Coverage for “certified” acts
    of terrorism is fully reinsured by third party insurance
    companies and the Federal government with no exposure to
    PPIC. Prior to the formation of PPIC, we were uninsured for
    losses under NBCR coverage. Subsequently, we have $1.5 billion
    of NBCR coverage under TRIPRA, for which PPIC is responsible
    for 15% of each NBCR loss and the insurance company deductible
    of $1,000,000. We are ultimately responsible for any loss
borne by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties (which are generally non-recourse to us), senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance and/or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Because we operate one hotel property, we face the risks associated with the hospitality industry.

We own the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City. If the hotel does not generate sufficient receipts, our cash flow would be decreased, which could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders. The following factors, among others, are common to the hotel industry, and may reduce the revenues generated by our hotel property:

•

our hotel competes for guests with other hotels, a number of which have greater marketing and financial resources;

•

if there is an increase in operating costs resulting from inflation and other factors, we may not be able to offset such increase by increasing room rates;

•

our hotel is subject to the fluctuating and seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism;

•

our hotel is subject to general and local economic and social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, including war and terrorism; and

•

physical condition, which may require substantial additional capital.


Because of the ownership structure of our hotel, we face potential adverse effects from changes to the applicable tax laws.

Under the Internal Revenue Code, REITs like us are not allowed to operate hotels directly or indirectly. Accordingly, we lease The Hotel Pennsylvania to our taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS. While the TRS structure allows the economic benefits of ownership to flow to us, the TRS is subject to tax on its income from the operations of the hotel at the federal and state level. In addition, the TRS is subject to detailed tax regulations that affect how it may be capitalized and operated. If the tax laws applicable to a TRS are modified, we may be forced to modify the structure for owning the hotel, and such changes may adversely affect the cash flows from the hotel. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, and we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations,
interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any of such actions may prospectively or retroactively modify the tax treatment of the TRS and, therefore, may adversely affect our after-tax returns from the hotel.

Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.

The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. From time to time persons have asserted claims against us with respect to some of our properties under this Act, but to date such claims have not resulted in any material expense or liability. If, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders.

Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.


OUR INVESTMENTS ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON, DC METROPOLITAN AREAS. CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING THESE AREAS GENERALLY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

A significant portion of our properties are in the New York City/New Jersey and Washington, DC metropolitan areas and are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent to those areas.

During 2007, approximately 71% of our EBITDA, excluding items that affect comparability, came from properties located in the New York City and Washington, DC metropolitan areas and in New Jersey. In addition, we may continue to concentrate a significant portion of our future acquisitions in these metropolitan areas or in other geographic real estate markets in the United States or abroad. Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns, as they have in the past, and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact these markets in both the short and long term. Declines in the economy or a decline in the real estate markets in these areas could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties. The factors affecting economic conditions in these regions include:

•

space needs of the United States Government, including the effect of base closures and repositioning under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 2005, as amended;

•

business layoffs or downsizing;

•

industry slowdowns;

•

relocations of businesses;

•

changing demographics;

•

increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places;

•

financial performance and productivity of the publishing, advertising, financial, technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries;

•

infrastructure quality; and

•

any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.

It is impossible for us to assess the future effects of the current uncertain trends in the economic and investment climates of the geographic areas in which we concentrate, and more generally of the United States, or the real estate markets in these areas. If these conditions persist or if there is any local, national or global economic downturn, our businesses and future profitability may be adversely affected.

Terrorist attacks, such as those of September

11, 2001 in New York City and the Washington, DC area, may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.

We have significant investments in large metropolitan areas, including the New York, Washington, DC, Chicago, Boston and San Francisco metropolitan areas. In the aftermath of a terrorist attack, tenants in these areas may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in these areas. This in turn would trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these areas, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease our properties on less favorable terms. As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues and cash flows could decline materially.


WE MAY

ACQUIRE OR SELL ADDITIONAL ASSETS OR ENTITIES OR DEVELOP ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES. OUR FAILURE OR INABILITY TO CONSUMMATE THESE TRANSACTIONS OR MANAGE THE RESULTS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

We have grown rapidly through acquisitions. We may not be able to maintain this rapid growth and our failure to do so could adversely affect our stock price.

We have experienced rapid growth in recent years, increasing our total assets from approximately $565 million at December 31, 1997 to approximately $22.5 billion at December 31, 2007. We may not be able to maintain a similar rate of growth in the future or manage our growth effectively. Our failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.

We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks.

We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies. We may not, however, succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. In addition, we may face competition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. When we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover our costs of acquisition and development or in operating the businesses we acquired.  Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management’s attention. Acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in
poorer than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated. Furthermore, our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware at the time of acquisition. In addition, development of our existing properties presents similar risks.

From time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, one or more material acquisitions.  The announcement of such a material acquisition may result in a significant decline in the price of our common shares.

We are continuously looking at material transactions that we will believe will maximize shareholder value.  However, an announcement by us of one or more significant acquisitions could result in a quick and significant decline in the price of our common shares and convertible and exchangeable securities.

It may be difficult to buy and sell real estate quickly.

Real estate investments are relatively difficult to buy and sell quickly. Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.

We may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the debt associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs.

As part of an acquisition of a property, including our January 1, 2002 acquisition of Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P.’s 13.0 million square foot portfolio, we may agree, and in the case of Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P. did agree, with the seller that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on them for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the seller. These agreements could result in our holding on to properties that we would otherwise sell and not pay down or refinance indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance.


On January

1, 2002, we completed the acquisition of the 66% interest in Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P. that we did not previously own. The terms of the merger restrict our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of, or to finance or refinance, the properties formerly owned by Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P., which could result in our inability to sell these properties at an opportune time and increased costs to us.

Subject to limited exceptions, we are restricted from selling or otherwise transferring or disposing of certain properties located in the Crystal City area of Arlington, Virginia for a period of 12 years. These restrictions, which currently cover approximately 13.0 million square feet of space, could result in our inability to sell these properties at an opportune time and increase costs to us.

From time to time we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control. Some of these companies operate in industries that differ from our current operations, with different risks than investing in real estate.

From time to time we make debt or equity investments in other companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control. These investments include but are not limited to:  Alexander’s, Inc., Toys, The Lexington Master Limited Partnership, GMH Communities L.P. and equity and mezzanine investments in other entities that have significant real estate assets. Although these businesses generally have a significant real estate component, certain operate in businesses that are different from our primary lines of business including, without limitation, operating or managing toy stores, department stores, student and military housing facilities. Consequently, our investment in these businesses, among other risks, subjects us to the operating and financial risks of industries other than real estate and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of
these businesses. From time to time we may make additional investments in or acquire other entities that may subject us to additional similar risks. Our investments in entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures, present additional risks such as our having differing objectives than our partners or the entities in which we invest, or our becoming involved in disputes, or competing with those persons. In addition, we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to comply with applicable standards may adversely affect us.

We are subject to risks that affect the general retail environment.

A substantial proportion of our properties are in the retail shopping center real estate market and we have a significant investment in retailers such as Toys. See “

Our investment in Toys “R” Us, Inc. subjects us to risks different from our other lines of business and may result in increased seasonality and volatility in our reported earnings

” below. This means that we are subject to factors that affect the retail environment generally, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, the threat of terrorism and increasing competition from discount retailers, outlet malls, retail websites and catalog companies. These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants and the retailers in which we hold an investment and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers.

We depend upon our anchor tenants to attract shoppers.

We own several regional malls and other shopping centers that are typically anchored by well-known department stores and other tenants who generate shopping traffic at the mall or shopping center. The value of our properties would be adversely affected if tenants or anchors failed to meet their contractual obligations, sought concessions in order to continue operations or ceased their operations. If the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to economic conditions, closing of anchors or for other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the event of a default by a tenant or anchor, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord.


Our investment in Toys “R” Us, Inc. subjects us to risks different from our other lines of business and may result in increased seasonality and volatility in our reported earnings.

On July 21, 2005, a joint venture that we own equally with Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. acquired Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”). Because Toys is a retailer, its operations subject us to the risks of a retail company that are different than those presented by our other lines of business. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. In addition, our fiscal year ends on December 31 whereas, as is common for retailers, Toys’ fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. Therefore, we record our pro-rata share of Toys’ net earnings on a one quarter-lag basis. For example, our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2007 include Toys’ financial results for its first, second and third quarters ended
October 28, 2006, as well as Toys’ fourth quarter results of 2005. Because of the seasonality of Toys, our reported net income will likely show increased volatility. We may also, in the future and from time to time, invest in other businesses that may report financial results that are more volatile than our historical financial results.

We invest in subordinated or mezzanine debt of certain entities that have significant real estate assets.  These investments involve greater risk of loss than investments in senior mortgage loans.

We
    invest, and may in the future invest, in subordinated or
    mezzanine debt of certain entities that have significant
    real estate assets. As of December 31, 2007, our mezzanine
    debt securities have an aggregate carrying amount of $492,339,000.
    These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage
    loans secured by the real property, are generally secured
    by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning
    the underlying real estate. These investments involve greater
    risk of loss than investments in senior mortgage loans which
    are secured by real property. If a borrower defaults on debt
    to us or on debt senior to us, or declares bankruptcy, we
    may not be able to recover some or all of our investment.
    The value of the assets securing or supporting our investments
    could deteriorate over time due to factors beyond our control,
    including acts or omissions by owners, changes in business,
    economic or market conditions, or foreclosure. Such deteriorations
    in value may result in the recognition of impairment losses
    on our statement of operations. In addition, there may be
    significant delays and costs associated with the process
of foreclosing on collateral securing or supporting our investments.

We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans, if circumstances warrant, to determine whether they are impaired. A loan is impaired when based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan’s effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  There can be no assurance that our estimates of collectible amounts will not change over time or that they will be representative of the amounts we actually collect, including amounts we would collect if we chose to sell these investments before
their maturity.  If we collect less than our estimates, we will record charges which could be material.

We invest in marketable equity securities of companies that have significant real estate assets.  The value of these investments may decline as a result of operating performance or economic or market conditions.

We invest, and may in the future invest, in marketable equity securities of publicly-traded real estate companies or companies that have significant real estate assets.  As of December 31, 2007, our marketable securities have an aggregate carrying amount of $323,106,000.  Significant declines in the value of these investments due to operating performance or economic or market conditions may result in the recognition of impairment losses on our statement of operations.


OUR ORGANIZATIONAL AND FINANCIAL STRUCTURE GIVES RISE TO OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS.

We May

Not Be Able to Obtain Capital to Make Investments.

We depend primarily on external financing to fund the growth of our business. This is because one of the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for a REIT is that it distribute 90% of its net taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its shareholders. There is a separate requirement to distribute net capital gains or pay a corporate level tax in lieu thereof. Our access to debt or equity financing depends on the willingness of third parties to lend or make equity investments and on conditions in the capital markets generally. We and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time. Although we believe that we will be able to finance any investments we may wish to make in the foreseeable future, new financing may not be available on acceptable terms.

For information about our available sources of funds, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Vornado Realty Trust depends on dividends and distributions from its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The creditors and preferred security holders of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to Vornado Realty Trust.

Substantially all of Vornado Realty Trust’s assets are held through its Operating Partnership that holds substantially all of its properties and assets through subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership’s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by its subsidiaries, and in turn, substantially all of Vornado Realty Trust’s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by the Operating Partnership. The creditors of each of Vornado Realty Trust’s direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations to them, when due and payable, before distributions may be made by that subsidiary to its equity holders. Thus, the Operating Partnership’s ability to make distributions to holders of its units depends on its subsidiaries’ ability first to satisfy their obligations to their creditors and then to make distributions to
the Operating Partnership. Likewise, Vornado Realty Trust’s ability to pay dividends to holders of common and preferred shares depends on the Operating Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions payable to holders of preferred units and then to make distributions to Vornado Realty Trust.

Furthermore, the holders of preferred units of the Operating Partnership are entitled to receive preferred distributions before payment of distributions to holders of common units of the Operating Partnership, including Vornado Realty Trust. Thus, Vornado Realty Trust’s ability to pay dividends to holders of its shares and satisfy its debt obligations depends on the Operating Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions payable to holders of preferred units and then to make distributions to Vornado Realty Trust. As of December 31, 2007, there were nine series of preferred units of the Operating Partnership not held by Vornado Realty Trust that have preference over Vornado Realty Trust common shares with a total liquidation value of $399,347,000.

In addition, Vornado Realty Trust’s participation in any distribution of the assets of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency, is only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors and preferred security holders, are satisfied.

We have indebtedness, and this indebtedness, and its cost, may increase.

As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $12.952 billion of total debt outstanding, including our pro rata share of debt of partially owned entities. Our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value was approximately 47%. When we say “enterprise value” in the preceding sentence, we mean market equity value of Vornado Realty Trust’s common and preferred shares plus total debt outstanding, including our pro rata share of debt of partially owned entities. In the future, we may incur additional debt, and thus increase our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value, to finance acquisitions or property developments. If our level of indebtedness increases, there may be an increased risk of a credit rating downgrade or a default on our obligations that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in a rising interest rate environment,
the cost of our existing variable rate debt and any new debt or other market rate security or instrument may increase.


Covenants in our debt instruments could adversely affect our financial condition and our acquisitions and development activities.

The mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage. Our unsecured credit facilities, unsecured debt securities and other loans that we may obtain in the future contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including covenants that limit our ability to incur debt based upon the level of our ratio of total debt to total assets, our ratio of secured debt to total assets, our ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, and fixed charges, and that require us to maintain a certain level of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt. Our ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to compliance with certain financial and other covenants. In addition, failure to comply with our
covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt instrument, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or be available only on unattractive terms. Additionally, our ability to satisfy current or prospective lenders’ insurance requirements may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon greater insurance coverage against acts of terrorism than is available to us in the marketplace or on commercially reasonable terms.

We rely on debt financing, including borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities, issuances of unsecured debt securities and debt secured by individual properties, to finance acquisitions and development activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt financing from these or other sources, or refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected. If we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders can declare a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of the property securing the defaulted loan.

Vornado Realty Trust may fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT and may be required to pay income taxes at corporate rates.

Although we believe that we will remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may fail to remain qualified in this way. Qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. Our qualification as a REIT also depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to the requirements for qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT.

If, with respect to any taxable year, we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions, we could not deduct distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The federal income tax payable would include any applicable alternative minimum tax. If we had to pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute to shareholders and pay our indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved, and we would no longer be required to distribute money to shareholders. In addition, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost, unless we were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions. Although we currently intend to
operate in a manner designed to allow us to qualify as a REIT, future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause us to revoke the REIT election or fail to qualify as a REIT.

We face possible adverse changes in tax laws, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.

From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. The shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for payment of dividends.

Loss of our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common shares.

We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado Realty Trust, and Michael D. Fascitelli, the President of Vornado Realty Trust. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common shares.


VORNADO REALTY TRUST'S CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND APPLICABLE LAW MAY HINDER ANY ATTEMPT TO ACQUIRE US.

Our Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust sets limits on the ownership of our shares.

Generally, for Vornado Realty Trust to maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% in value of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of Vornado Realty Trust may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of Vornado Realty Trust’s taxable year. The Internal Revenue Code defines “individuals” for purposes of the requirement described in the preceding sentence to include some types of entities. Under Vornado Realty Trust’s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as amended, no person may own more than 6.7% of the outstanding common shares of any class, or 9.9% of the outstanding preferred shares of any class, with some exceptions for persons who held common shares in excess of the 6.7% limit before Vornado Realty Trust adopted the limit and other persons approved by
Vornado Realty Trust’s Board of Trustees. These restrictions on transferability and ownership may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado Realty Trust or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the shareholders. We refer to Vornado Realty Trust’s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as amended, as the “declaration of trust.”

We have a classified Board of Trustees and that may reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Vornado Realty Trust’s Board of Trustees is divided into three classes of trustees. Trustees of each class are chosen for three-year staggered terms. Staggered terms of trustees may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of Vornado Realty Trust, even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of Vornado Realty Trust’s shareholders.

We may issue additional shares in a manner that could adversely affect the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Vornado Realty Trust’s declaration of trust authorizes the Board of Trustees to:

•

cause Vornado Realty Trust to issue additional authorized but unissued common shares or preferred shares;

•

classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred shares;

•

set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified shares that Vornado Realty Trust issues; and

•

increase, without shareholder approval, the number of shares of beneficial interest that Vornado Realty Trust may issue.

The Board of Trustees could establish a series of preferred shares whose terms could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado Realty Trust or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of Vornado Realty Trust’s shareholders, although the Board of Trustees does not now intend to establish a series of preferred shares of this kind. Vornado Realty Trust’s declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado Realty Trust or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders.

The Maryland General Corporation Law contains provisions that may reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, as amended, which we refer to as the “MGCL,” as applicable to real estate investment trusts, certain “business combinations,” including certain mergers, consolidations, share exchanges and asset transfers and certain issuances and reclassifications of equity securities, between a Maryland real estate investment trust and any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the trust’s shares or an affiliate or an associate, as defined in the MGCL, of the trust who, at any time within the two-year period before the date in question, was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting shares of beneficial interest of the trust, which we refer to as an “interested shareholder,” or an affiliate of the interested shareholder, are prohibited for five
years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder. After that five-year period, any business combination of these kinds must be recommended by the board of trustees of the trust and approved by the affirmative vote of at least (a) 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of beneficial interest of the trust and (b) two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting shares of the trust other than shares held by the interested shareholder with whom, or with whose affiliate, the business combination is to be effected, unless, among other conditions, the trust’s common shareholders receive a minimum price, as defined in the MGCL, for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares.


The provisions of the MGCL do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of trustees of the applicable trust before the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, and a person is not an interested shareholder if the board of trustees approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested shareholder.

In approving a transaction, the Board may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the Board.  Vornado Realty Trust’s Board has adopted a resolution exempting any business combination between any trustee or officer of Vornado Realty Trust, or their affiliates, and Vornado Realty Trust. As a result, the trustees and officers of Vornado Realty Trust and their affiliates may be able to enter into business combinations with Vornado Realty Trust that may not be in the best interest of shareholders. With respect to business combinations with other persons, the business combination provisions of the MGCL may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Vornado Realty Trust or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the
shareholders. The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of Vornado Realty Trust and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.

We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our shareholders.

Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other companies, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Trustees. Accordingly, our shareholders do not control these policies.

OUR OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE AND RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS MAY

GIVE RISE TO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

Steven Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of our other trustees and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.

As of December 31, 2007, Interstate Properties, a New Jersey general partnership, and its partners owned approximately 8.3% of the common shares of Vornado Realty Trust and approximately 27.2% of the common stock of Alexander’s, Inc. Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the three partners of Interstate Properties. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado Realty Trust, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties and the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s. Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are trustees of Vornado Realty Trust and also directors of Alexander’s.

As of December 31, 2007, the Operating Partnership owned 32.8% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s. Alexander’s is a REIT engaged in leasing, managing, developing and redeveloping properties, focusing primarily on the locations where its department stores operated before they ceased operations in 1992. Alexander’s has seven properties, which are located in the New York City metropolitan area. Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli, the President and a trustee of Vornado Realty Trust, are directors of Alexander’s. Messrs. Mandelbaum, West and Wight are trustees of Vornado Realty Trust and are directors of Alexander’s.

Because of these overlapping interests, Mr. Roth and Interstate Properties and its partners may have substantial influence over Vornado Realty Trust and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Vornado Realty Trust shareholders for approval. In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate Properties and our other equity or debt holders. In addition, Mr. Roth, Interstate Properties and its partners, and Alexander’s currently and may in the future engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as which of these entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of
properties and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these entities.

Vornado Realty Trust currently manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate Properties under a management agreement for which it receives an annual fee equal to 4% of base rent and percentage rent and certain other commissions. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term. Vornado Realty Trust earned $800,000, $798,000, and $791,000 of management fees under the management agreement for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Because of the relationship among Vornado Realty Trust, Interstate Properties and Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight, as described above, the terms of the management agreement and any future agreements between Vornado Realty Trust and Interstate Properties may not be comparable to those Vornado Realty Trust could have
negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.


There may be conflicts of interest between Alexander’s and us.

As of December 31, 2007, the Operating Partnership owned 32.8% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s. Alexander’s is a REIT engaged in leasing, managing, developing and redeveloping properties, focusing primarily on the locations where its department stores operated before they ceased operations in 1992. Alexander’s has seven properties. Interstate Properties, which is described above, and its partners owned an additional 27.2% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s, as of December 31, 2007. Mr. Roth, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado Realty Trust, is Chief Executive Officer, a director of Alexander’s and managing general partner of Interstate, and Mr. Fascitelli, President and a trustee of Vornado Realty Trust, is President and a director of Alexander’s. Messrs. Mandelbaum, West and Wight, trustees of
us, are also directors of Alexander’s and general partners of Interstate. Alexander’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “ALX.”

The Operating Partnership manages, develops and leases the Alexander’s properties under management and development agreements and leasing agreements under which the Operating Partnership receives annual fees from Alexander’s. These agreements have a one-year term expiring in March of each year and are all automatically renewable. Because Vornado Realty Trust and Alexander’s share common senior management and because a majority of the trustees of Vornado Realty Trust also constitute the majority of the directors of Alexander’s, the terms of the foregoing agreements and any future agreements between us and Alexander’s may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.

For a description of Interstate Properties’ ownership of Vornado Realty Trust and Alexander’s, see “Steven Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of our other trustees and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us” above.

THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF VORNADO REALTY TRUST AND THE MARKET FOR THOSE SHARES GIVE RISE TO VARIOUS RISKS.

Vornado Realty Trust has many shares available for future sale, which could hurt the market price of its shares.

As of December 31, 2007, we had authorized but unissued, 96,923,394 common shares of beneficial interest, $.04 par value, and 76,016,023 preferred shares of beneficial interest, no par value, of which 68,016,023 preferred shares have not been reserved and remain available for issuance as a newly-designated class of preferred. We may issue these authorized but unissued shares from time to time in public or private offerings or in connection with acquisitions.

In addition, as of December 31, 2007, 14,556,397 common shares were reserved for issuance upon redemption of Operating Partnership common units. Some of these shares may be sold in the public market after registration under the Securities Act under registration rights agreements between Vornado Realty Trust and some holders of common units of the Operating Partnership. These shares may also be sold in the public market under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or other available exemptions from registration. In addition, we have reserved a number of common shares for issuance under employee benefit plans, and these common shares will be available for sale from time to time. We have awarded shares of restricted stock and granted options to purchase additional common shares to some of our executive officers and employees. Of the authorized but unissued common and preferred shares above,
51,052,118 common and 8,000,000 preferred shares, in the aggregate, were reserved for issuance upon the redemption of Operating Partnership units, conversion of outstanding convertible securities, under benefit plans or for other activity not directly under our control.

We cannot predict the effect that future sales of Vornado Realty Trust common and preferred shares or Operating Partnership common and preferred units will have on the market prices of Vornado Realty Trust’s outstanding shares.


Changes in market conditions could hurt the market price of Vornado Realty Trust’s shares.

The value of our common and preferred shares depends on various market conditions, which may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the value of our common and preferred shares are the following:

•

the extent of institutional investor interest in us;

•

the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and fixed income securities;

•

our financial condition and performance; and

•

general financial market and economic conditions.

The stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies.

Increased market interest rates may hurt the value of Vornado Realty Trust’s common and preferred shares.

We believe that investors consider the distribution rate on REIT shares, expressed as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates as an important factor in deciding whether to buy or sell the shares. If market interest rates go up, prospective purchasers of REIT shares may expect a higher distribution rate. Higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and might decrease funds available for distribution. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of Vornado Realty Trust’s common and preferred shares to decline.

New York Office Properties lease terms generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenant spaces to as long as 15 years for major tenants, and may include extension options at market rates. Leases typically provide for step-ups in rent periodically over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants the tenant’s share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year. Electricity is provided to tenants on a sub-metered basis or included in rent based on surveys and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases. Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.

Washington, DC Office Properties leases are typically for four to seven year terms, and may provide for extension options at either pre-negotiated or market rates. Most leases provide for annual rental escalations throughout the lease term, plus recovery of increases in real estate taxes and certain property operating expenses over a base year. Annual rental escalations are typically based upon either fixed percentage increases or the consumer price index. Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.

RETAIL PROPERTIES SEGMENT

As of December 31, 2007, we own 177 retail properties, of which 147 are strip shopping centers located primarily in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and California; 8 are regional malls located in New York, New Jersey, Virginia and San Juan, Puerto Rico; and 22 are retail properties located in Manhattan (“Manhattan Street Retail”).  Our strip shopping centers and malls are generally located on major highways in mature, densely populated areas, and therefore attract consumers from a regional, rather than a neighborhood market place.

Strip Shopping Centers

Our strip shopping centers contain an aggregate of 15.8 million square feet and are substantially (over 80%) leased to large stores (over 20,000 square feet). Tenants include destination retailers such as discount department stores, supermarkets, home improvement stores, discount apparel stores and membership warehouse clubs. Tenants typically offer basic consumer necessities such as food, health and beauty aids, moderately priced clothing, building materials and home improvement supplies, and compete primarily on the basis of price and location.

Regional Malls

The Green Acres Mall in Long Island, New York contains 1.8 million square feet, and is anchored by Sears, J.C. Penney, Macy’s and Macy’s Furniture Gallery, Wal-Mart and a BJ’s Wholesale Club.

The Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, New Jersey, in which we own a 50% interest, contains 1.4 million square feet and is anchored by Macy’s, Lord & Taylor, J.C. Penney and Boscovs, three of which own their stores aggregating 719,000 square feet. The joint venture plans to construct 60,000 square feet of free-standing retail space in the mall complex, subject to governmental approvals.  The expansion is expected to be completed during 2008.

The Springfield Mall in Springfield, Virginia contains 1.2 million square feet and is anchored by Macy’s, and J.C. Penney and Target who own their stores aggregating 390,000 square feet.  We intend to redevelop, reposition and re-tenant the mall.

Shopping center lease terms range from five years or less in some instances for smaller tenant spaces to as long as 25 years for major tenants. Leases generally provide for additional rents based on a percentage of tenants’ sales and pass through to tenants the tenants’ share of all common area charges (including roof and structure in strip shopping centers, unless it is the tenant’s direct responsibility), real estate taxes and insurance costs and certain capital expenditures. Percentage rent accounted for less than 1% of 2007 Retail Properties total revenues. None of the tenants in the Retail Properties segment accounted for more than 10% of 2007 Retail Properties total revenues.

Office lease terms generally range from three to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 15 years for large tenants. Leases typically provide for step-ups in rent periodically over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants the tenants’ share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses for a building over a base year. Electricity is provided to tenants on a sub-metered basis or included in rent and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases. Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction of its premises.

This mortgage loan is cross-collateralized by 555 California Street and 315 and 345 Montgomery Streets

Lease terms generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenant spaces to as long as 15 years for major tenants, and may include extension options at market rates. Leases typically provide for step-ups in rent periodically over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants the tenant’s share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year.  Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.

Lexington Master Limited Partnership (“Lexington MLP”)

At December 31, 2007, we own 8,149,593 limited partnership units of Lexington MLP, which are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common shares of Lexington Realty Trust (NYSE: LXP) (“Lexington”), or a 7.5% limited partnership interest.  The assets of Lexington consist of approximately 311 single-tenant commercial properties containing an aggregate of 49.3 million square feet, located in 44 states, which are generally net-leased to major corporations.

Lexington MLP has approximately $3.320 billion of debt outstanding as of December 31, 2007, of which our pro rata share is $248,690,000, none of which is recourse to us.

At December 31, 2007, the fair value of our investment in Lexington MLP based on Lexington’s December 31, 2007 closing share price of $14.54, was $118,495,000, or $39,836,000 below the carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet.  We have concluded that as of December 31, 2007, the decline in the value of our investment is not “other-than-temporary.”

GMH Communities L.P.

At December 31, 2007, we own 7,337,857 GMH Communities L.P. (“GMH”) limited partnership units, which are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common shares of GMH Communities Trust (NYSE: GCT) (“GCT”), and 2,517,247 common shares of GCT, or 13.8% of the limited partnership interest of GMH.   GMH is a self-advised, self-managed, specialty housing company that focuses on providing housing to college and university students residing off-campus and to members of the U.S. military and their families located on or near military bases throughout the United States.  GMH has $995,818,000 of debt outstanding at December 31, 2007, of which our pro-rata share is $137,722,000, none of which is recourse to us.

On February 12, 2008, GCT announced that it has entered into two definitive agreements in connection with the sale of its military and student housing divisions for an aggregate sales price of approximately $9.61 per share/unit.   In addition, GCT anticipates selling its remaining assets prior to the closing of the merger.  The merger, which has been unanimously approved by GCT’s Board of Trustees, is subject to GCT shareholder approval and customary closing conditions.

As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of our investment in GMH and GCT based on GCT’s December 31, 2007 closing share price of $5.52, was $54,400,000, or $48,860,000 below the carrying amount of $10.48 per share/unit on our consolidated balance sheet.  We have concluded that as of December 31, 2007, the decline in the value of our investment is not “other-than-temporary,” based on the aggregate value anticipated to be received as a result of the transactions described above, including the additional consideration from the sale of GCT’s remaining assets.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including the matters referred to below, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Stop & Shop

On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (“USDC-NJ”) claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that a prior order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York dated February 6, 2001, as modified on appeal to the District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 13, 2001, froze our right to re-allocate which effectively terminated our right to collect the additional rent from Stop & Shop. On March 3, 2003, after we moved to
dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Stop & Shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint. On March 26, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a new complaint in New York Supreme Court, asserting substantially the same claims as in its USDC-NJ complaint. We removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In January 2005 that court remanded the action to the New York Supreme Court. On February 14, 2005, we served an answer in which we asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the motions
for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Court’s decision and on December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Court’s decision.  On January 16, 2007, we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Court’s decision which was denied on March 13, 2007.  We are currently engaged in discovery and anticipate that a trial date will be set for some time in 2008.  We intend to vigorously pursue our claims against Stop & Shop.  In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street

On May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas and the 555 California Street complex.  Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties.  The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump.

In August 2005, Mr. Trump brought a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court against, among others, the general partners of the partnerships referred to above.   Mr. Trump’s claims arose out of a dispute over the sale price of, and use of proceeds from, the sale of properties located on the former Penn Central rail yards between West 59th and 72nd Streets in Manhattan which were formerly owned by the partnerships.  In decisions dated September 14, 2005 and July 24, 2006, the Court denied various of Mr. Trump’s motions and ultimately dismissed all of Mr. Trump’s claims, except for his claim seeking access to books and records.  In a decision dated October 1, 2007, the Court determined that Mr. Trump had already received access to the books and records to which he was entitled, with the exception of certain documents which were subsequently
delivered to Mr. Trump.  Mr. Trump has sought re-argument and renewal on, and filed a notice of appeal in connection with, his dismissed claims.

In connection with the acquisition, we agreed to indemnify the sellers for liabilities and expenses arising out of Mr. Trump’s claim that the general partners of the partnerships we acquired did not sell the rail yards at a fair price or could have sold the rail yards for a greater price and any other claims asserted in the legal action; provided however, that if Mr. Trump prevails on certain claims involving partnership matters, other than claims relating to sale price, the sellers will be required to reimburse us for certain costs related to those claims.  We believe that the claims relating to the sale price are without merit.  All other allegations are not asserted as a basis for damages and regardless of merit would not be material to our consolidated financial statements.

________________________________

(1)

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is used by management, investors and industry analysts as a supplemental measure of operating performance of equity REITs. FFO should be evaluated along with GAAP net income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure), as well as cash
flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating performance of equity REITs. Management believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because this measure excludes the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, this non-GAAP measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in our Statements of Cash Flows. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance
or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

Overview

We own and operate office, retail and showroom properties (our “core” operations) with large concentrations of office and retail properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC and Northern Virginia area. In addition, we have a 47.6% interest in Americold Realty Trust (“Americold”), which owns and operates 90 cold storage warehouses nationwide, a 32.8% interest in Alexander’s Inc., which has seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, and a 32.7% interest in Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”) which has a significant real estate component, as well as other real estate and related investments.

We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers. Principal factors of competition are effective rents, attractiveness of location and quality and breadth of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.

Our ultimate business objective is to maximize shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. The table below compares our total return performance to the Morgan Stanley REIT Index (“RMS”) for the following periods ending December 31, 2007 (past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance):

Beginning in the second half of 2007, the residential mortgage and capital markets began showing signs of stress, primarily in the form of escalating default rates on sub-prime mortgages and declining residential housing prices nationwide.  This “credit” crisis spread to the broader commercial credit markets and has generally reduced the availability of financing and widened spreads.  These factors, coupled with a slowing economy, may negatively impact the volume of real estate transactions and cap rates, which would negatively impact stock price performance of public real estate companies, including ours.  Our one-year total return to shareholders for the period ending December 31, 2007 was negative 25.5% and the RMS’ total return for the same period was negative 16.8%.  Although our core operating results were not negatively impacted by these conditions in 2007, if these
conditions persist in 2008 and beyond, our real estate portfolio may experience lower occupancy and effective rents which would result in a corresponding decrease in net income, funds from operations and cash flows.  In addition, the value of our investments in joint ventures, marketable securities and mezzanine loans may also decline as a result of the above factors.  Such declines may result in impairment charges and/or valuation allowances which would result in a corresponding decrease in net income and funds from operations.

We intend to achieve our ultimate business objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through:

•

Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

•

Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is high likelihood of capital appreciation;

•

Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

•

Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;

•

Investing in fully-integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate component;

•

Developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and

•

Providing specialty financing to real estate related companies.

Acquisitions and Investments

During 2007, we completed $4,045,400,000 of real estate acquisitions and investments in 33 separate transactions, consisting of an aggregate of $3,024,600,000 in cash, $958,700,000 in existing mortgage debt and $62,100,000 in common and preferred Operating Partnership units.  Details of the significant transactions are summarized below.

100 West 33

rd

Street, New York City (the “Manhattan Mall”)

On January 10, 2007, we acquired the Manhattan Mall for approximately $689,000,000 in cash.  This mixed-use property is located on the entire Sixth Avenue block-front between 32

nd

and 33

rd

Streets in Manhattan and contains approximately 1,000,000 square feet, including 845,000 square feet of office space and 164,000 square feet of retail space. Included as part of the acquisition were 250,000 square feet of additional air rights.  The property is adjacent to our Hotel Pennsylvania.  At closing, we completed a $232,000,000 financing secured by the property, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.55% (5.20% at December 31, 2007) and has a two-year initial term with three one-year extension options.  The operations of the office component of the property are included in the New York Office segment and the operations of the retail component are included in the Retail
segment.  We consolidate the accounts of this property into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

Bruckner Plaza, Bronx, New York

On January 11, 2007, we acquired the Bruckner Plaza shopping center, containing 386,000 square feet, for $165,000,000 in cash.  Also included as part of the acquisition was an adjacent parcel which is ground leased to a third party.  The property is located on Bruckner Boulevard in the Bronx, New York.  We consolidate the accounts of this property into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

H Street Building Corporation (“H Street”)

In
    July 2005, we acquired H Street, which owns a 50% interest
    in real estate assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia
    and Washington, DC. On April 30, 2007, we acquired the corporations
    that own the remaining 50% interest in these assets for approximately
    $383,000,000, consisting of $322,000,000 in cash and $61,000,000
    of existing mortgages. These assets include twin office buildings
    located in Washington, DC, containing 577,000 square feet,
    and assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia, comprised
    of 34 acres of land leased to three residential and retail
    operators, a 1,680 unit high-rise apartment complex and 10
    acres of vacant land. In conjunction with this acquisition
    all existing litigation was dismissed. Beginning on April
    30, 2007, we consolidate the accounts of these entities into
    our consolidated financial statements and ceased accounting
for them on the equity method.

Further, we agreed to sell approximately 19.6 of the 34 acres of land to one of the existing ground lessees in two closings over a two-year period for approximately $220,000,000.  On May 11, 2007, we closed on the sale of 11 of the 19.6 acres for $104,000,000 and received $5,000,000 in cash and a $99,000,000 note due December 31, 2007.  On September 28, 2007, the buyer pre-paid the note in cash and we recognized a net gain on sale of $4,803,000.  In April 2007, we received letters from the two remaining ground lessees claiming a right of first offer on the sale of the land, one of which has since retracted its letter and reserved its rights under the lease.

In connection with purchase accounting, in July 2005 and April 2007 we recorded an aggregate of $220,000,000 of deferred tax liabilities for the differences between the tax basis and the book basis of the acquired assets and liabilities.  We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of February 2008, we have completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008.  Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, the deferred tax liabilities will be eliminated and we will recognize $220,000,000 as an income tax benefit on our consolidated statement of income.

The
    total purchase price for 100% of the assets we will own,
    after the anticipated proceeds from the land sales, is $409,000,000,
    consisting of $286,000,000 in cash and $123,000,000 of existing
mortgages.

1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street

On May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas, a 2,000,000 square foot Manhattan office building located on the block-front between 51

st

and 52

nd

Street on Avenue of the Americas, and the three- building 555 California Street complex (“555 California Street”) containing 1,800,000 square feet, known as the Bank of America Center, located at California and Montgomery Streets in San Francisco’s financial district.  The purchase price for our 70% interest in the real estate was approximately $1.8 billion, consisting of $1.0 billion of cash and $797,000,000 of existing debt.  Our share of the debt is comprised of $308,000,000 secured by 1290 Avenue of the Americas and $489,000,000 secured by 555 California Street.  Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies
that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties.  The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump.  The operations of 1290 Avenue of the Americas are included in the New York Office segment and the operations of 555 California Street are included in the Other segment.  We consolidate the accounts of these properties into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

In August 2005, Mr. Trump brought a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court against, among others, the general partners of the partnerships referred to above.   Mr. Trump’s claims arose out of a dispute over the sale price of, and use of proceeds from, the sale of properties located on the former Penn Central rail yards between West 59th and 72nd Streets in Manhattan which were formerly owned by the partnerships.  In decisions dated September 14, 2005 and July 24, 2006, the Court denied various of Mr. Trump’s motions and ultimately dismissed all of Mr. Trump’s claims, except for his claim seeking access to books and records.   In a decision dated October 1, 2007, the Court determined that Mr. Trump had already received access to the books and records to which he was entitled, with the exception of certain documents which were
subsequently delivered to Mr. Trump.  Mr. Trump has sought re-argument and renewal on, and filed a notice of appeal in connection with, his dismissed claims.

In connection with the acquisition, we agreed to indemnify the sellers for liabilities and expenses arising out of Mr. Trump’s claim that the general partners of the partnerships we acquired did not sell the rail yards at a fair price or could have sold the rail yards for a greater price and any other claims asserted in the legal action; provided however, that if Mr. Trump prevails on certain claims involving partnership matters, other than claims relating to sale price, the sellers will be required to reimburse us for certain costs related to those claims.  We believe that the claims relating to the sale price are without merit.  All other allegations are not asserted as a basis for damages and regardless of merit would not be material to our consolidated financial statements.

India Property Fund L.P.

On June 14, 2007, we committed to contribute $95,000,000 to the India Property Fund, L.P. (the “Fund”), established to acquire, manage and develop real estate in India.  In addition, we sold our interest in another India real estate partnership to the Fund for $77,000,000 and deferred the $3,700,000 net gain on sale.  On December 20, 2007, we increased our commitment to the Fund by $20,000,000.  As of December 31, 2007, the Fund has equity commitments aggregating $227,500,000, of which our $115,000,000 commitment represents 50.6%.  In January 2008, the Fund completed capital calls aggregating $50,400,000, of which our share was $25,500,000.

Shopping Center Portfolio Acquisition

On
    June 26, 2007, we entered into an agreement to acquire a
    portfolio of 15 shopping centers aggregating approximately
    1.9 million square feet for an aggregate purchase price of
    $351,000,000. The properties are located primarily in Northern
    New Jersey and Long Island, New York. We have completed the
    acquisition of nine of these properties for an aggregate
    purchase price of $250,478,000, consisting of $109,279,000
    in cash, $49,599,000 in Vornado Realty L.P. preferred units,
    $12,460,000 of Vornado Realty L.P. common units and $79,140,000
    of existing mortgage debt. We have determined not to complete
    the acquisition of the remaining six properties and have
    expensed $2,700,000 for costs of acquisitions not consummated
    on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

BNA Complex

On August 9, 2007, we acquired a three building complex from The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. (“BNA”) for $111,000,000 in cash.  The complex contains approximately 300,000 square feet and is located in Washington’s West End between Georgetown and the Central Business District.  We plan to convert two of these buildings to rental apartments.  We consolidate the accounts of these properties into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

Investments in Mezzanine Loans

At
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, we have investments in mezzanine
    loans with an aggregate carrying amount of $492,339,000 (net
    of a $57,000,000 allowance) and $561,164,000, respectively,
    substantially all of which are loans to companies that have
    significant real estate assets. Mezzanine loans are generally
    subordinate to first mortgage loans and are secured by pledges
    of equity interests of the entities owning the underlying
    real estate. During 2007 we were repaid principal amounts
    aggregating $241,000,000 and we made new investments in mezzanine
    loans aggregating $217,000,000. As of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, these investments had a weighted average interest rate
of 9.7% and 10.1%, respectively.

On
    June 5, 2007, we acquired a 42% interest in two MPH mezzanine
    loans totaling $158,700,000, for $66,000,000 in cash. The
    loans, which were due on February 8, 2008 and have not been
    repaid, are subordinate to $2.9 billion of mortgage and other
    debt and secured by the equity interests in four New York
    City properties: Worldwide Plaza, 1540 Broadway office condominium,
    527 Madison Avenue and Tower 56. We have reduced the net
    carrying amount of the loans to $9,000,000 by recognizing
    a $57,000,000 non-cash charge which is included as a reduction
    of “interest
    and other investment income” on our consolidated statement
    of income for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Dispositions

Investment in McDonald’s Corporation (“McDonalds”) (NYSE: MCD)

In July 2005 we acquired 858,000 McDonalds’ common shares at a weighted average price of $29.54 per share.  These shares were classified as “available-for-sale” marketable equity securities on our consolidated balance sheet and the fluctuations in the market value of these shares during the period of our ownership was recorded as “other comprehensive income” in the shareholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheet.  During October 2007, we sold all of these shares at a weighted average price of $56.45 per share and recognized a net gain of $23,090,000, representing accumulated appreciation during the period of our ownership.

During the second half of 2005, we acquired an economic interest in an additional 14,565,500 McDonalds’ common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which we purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on McDonalds’ common shares. These call and put options had an initial weighted-average strike price of $32.66 per share, or an aggregate of $475,692,000 and provided for net cash settlement. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increased at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and was decreased for dividends received. The options provided us with the same economic gain or loss as if we had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate purchase price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options
were derivatives and did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period were recognized as “investment income or loss” on our consolidated statements of income.  In 2006, we sold 2,119,500 of these shares at a weighted average price of $35.49 per share, and acquired an additional 1,250,000 option shares at a weighted average price of $33.08 per share. As of December 31, 2006, there were 13,695,500 option shares in the derivative position with an adjusted weighted average strike price of $32.70 per share.  During August, September and October 2007, we settled the 13,695,500 option shares and received an aggregate of $260,719,000 in cash.  During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized net gains of $108,821,000, $138,815,000 and $17,254,000, respectively, representing income from the mark-to-market of these shares during the period of our ownership
through their settlement, net of related LIBOR charges.

The aggregate net gain from inception of our investments in McDonalds in 2005 through final settlement in October 2007 was $289,414,000.

Vineland, New Jersey Shopping Center Property

On July 16, 2007, we sold our Vineland, New Jersey shopping center property for $2,774,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $1,708,000.

Crystal Mall Two

On August 9, 2007, we sold Crystal Mall Two, a 277,000 square foot office building located at 1801 South Bell Street in Crystal City for $103,600,000, which resulted in a net gain of $19,893,000.

Arlington Plaza

On October 17, 2007, we sold Arlington Plaza, a 188,000 square foot office building located in Arlington, Virginia for $71,500,000, which resulted in a net gain of $33,900,000.

Financings

The net proceeds we received from the debt financings summarized below were used primarily to fund acquisitions and investments and for other general corporate purposes.  In the future, we may seek to obtain additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings or asset sales, although we have no express policy with respect to these capital markets transactions.  We may also offer our shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise re-acquire our shares or any other securities in the future.

2.85% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2027

On March 21, 2007, we sold $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.85% convertible senior debentures due 2027, pursuant to an effective registration statement.  The aggregate net proceeds from this offering, after underwriters’ discounts and expenses, were approximately $1.37 billion.  The debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in 2012 for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures in 2012, 2017, and 2022 and in certain other limited circumstances.  The debentures are convertible, under certain circumstances, for cash and Vornado common shares at an initial conversion rate of 6.1553 common shares per $1,000 of principal amount of debentures.  The initial conversion price was $162.46, which represented a premium of 30% over the March 21, 2007 closing price for our common
shares. The principal amount of debentures will be settled for cash and the amount in excess of the principal defined as the conversion value will be settled in cash or, at our election, Vornado common shares.

We are amortizing the underwriters’ discount on a straight-line basis (which approximates the interest method) over the period from the date of issuance to the date of earliest redemption of April 1, 2012.  Because the conversion option associated with the debentures, when analyzed as a freestanding instrument, meets the criteria to be classified as equity specified by paragraphs 12 to 32 of EITF 00-19

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s own Common Stock,”

separate accounting for the conversion option under SFAS No. 133

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”

The net proceeds of the offering were contributed to the Operating Partnership in the form of an inter-company loan and the Operating Partnership guaranteed the payment of the debentures.

Revolving Credit Facility

On September 28, 2007, the Operating Partnership entered into a new $1.510 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which was increased by $85,000,000 on October 12, 2007 and can be increased to up to $2.0 billion during the initial term.  The new facility has a three-year term with two one-year extension options, bears interest at LIBOR plus 55 basis points (5.43% at December 31, 2007), based on our current credit ratings and requires the payment of an annual facility fee of 15 basis points.  Together with the existing $1.0 billion credit facility, the Operating Partnership has an aggregate of $2.595 billion of unsecured revolving credit.  Vornado is the guarantor of the Operating Partnership’s obligations under both revolving credit agreements.  The existing $1.0 billion credit facility’s financial covenants have been modified to conform to the financial covenants
under the new agreement.  Significant modifications include (i) changing the definition of Capitalization Value to exclude corporate unallocated general and administrative expenses and to reduce the capitalization rate to 6.5% from 7.5%, and (ii) changing the definition of Total Outstanding Indebtedness to exclude indebtedness of unconsolidated joint ventures.  Under the new agreement, “Equity Value” may not be less than Three Billion Dollars; “Total Outstanding Indebtedness” may not exceed sixty percent (60%) of “Capitalization Value;” the ratio of “Combined EBITDA” to “Fixed Charges,” each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not be less than 1.40 to 1.00; the ratio of “Unencumbered Combined EBITDA” to “Unsecured Interest Expense,” each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not be less than 1.50 to 1.00; at any time, “Unsecured Indebtedness” may not exceed
sixty percent (60%) of “Capitalization Value of Unencumbered Assets;” and the ratio of “Secured Indebtedness” to “Capitalization Value,” each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not exceed fifty percent (50%).  The new agreement also contains standard representations and warranties and other covenants.  The terms in quotations in this paragraph are all defined in the new agreement, which was filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 28, 2007, filed on October 4, 2007.

Other

In addition to the above, during 2007 we completed approximately $1.111 billion of property level financings and repaid approximately $412,674,000 of existing debt with a portion of the proceeds.

Other Investments

The Lexington Master Limited Partnership, formerly The Newkirk Master Limited Partnership

On December 31, 2006, Newkirk Realty Trust (NYSE: NKT) was acquired in a merger by Lexington Corporate Properties Trust (“Lexington”) (NYSE: LXP), a real estate investment trust.  We owned 10,186,991 limited partnership units (representing a 15.8% investment ownership interest) of Newkirk MLP, which was also acquired by Lexington as a subsidiary, and was renamed Lexington MLP.  The units in Newkirk MLP, which we accounted for on the equity method, were converted on a 0.80 for 1 basis into limited partnership units of Lexington MLP, which we also account for on the equity method.  The Lexington MLP units are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common shares of Lexington.  We record our pro rata share of Lexington MLP’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that Lexington
files its financial statements.

As of December 31, 2007, we own 8,149,593 limited partnership units of Lexington MLP, or a 7.5% ownership interest.  As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of our investment in Lexington MLP based on Lexington’s December 31, 2007 closing share price of $14.54, was $118,495,000, or $39,836,000 below the carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet.  We have concluded that as of December 31, 2007, the decline in the value of our investment is not “other-than-temporary.”

GMH Communities L.P. (“GMH”)

At December 31, 2007, we own 7,337,857 GMH Communities L.P. (“GMH”) limited partnership units, which are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common shares of GMH Communities Trust (NYSE: GCT) (“GCT”), and 2,517,247 common shares of GCT, or 13.8% of the limited partnership interest of GMH.   Our ownership interest was acquired primarily as a result of the exercise of stock purchase warrants during 2004 and 2006.  See Note 5 Derivative Instruments and Related Marketable Securities for details of the warrants.  We account for our investment in GMH on the equity method and record our pro rata share of GMH’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis as we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that GCT files its financial statements.

On February 12, 2008, GCT announced that it has entered into two definitive agreements in connection with the sale of its military and student housing divisions for an aggregate sales price of approximately $9.61 per share/unit.   In addition, GCT anticipates selling its remaining assets prior to the closing of the merger.  The merger, which has been unanimously approved by GCT’s Board of Trustees, is subject to GCT shareholder approval and customary closing conditions.

As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of our investment in GMH and GCT based on GCT’s December 31, 2007 closing share price of $5.52, was $54,400,000, or $48,860,000 below the carrying amount of $10.48 per share/unit on our consolidated balance sheet.  We have concluded that as of December 31, 2007, the decline in the value of our investment is not “other-than-temporary,” based on the aggregate value anticipated to be received as a result of the transactions described above, including the additional consideration from the sale of GCT’s remaining assets.

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.  The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Real Estate

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $16.565 billion and $11.471 billion, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. If we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated.

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in-place leases and customer relationships) and acquired liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141: Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions. Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment
if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If we incorrectly estimate the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows, initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different. The impact of our estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Identified Intangible Assets

Upon an acquisition of a business we record intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. We amortize identified intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset, including the related real estate when appropriate, is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets, a component of “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets, were $601,232,000 and $303,609,000, respectively. In addition, the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of “deferred credit” on our consolidated balance sheets, were $814,101,000 and $296,836,000, respectively. If the intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, or the estimated useful lives of finite-life intangibles assets or liabilities change, the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material.


Critical Accounting Policies – continued

Mezzanine Loans Receivable

We
    invest in mezzanine loans to entities which have significant
    real estate assets. These investments, which are subordinate
    to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally
    secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities
    owning the underlying real estate. We record investments
    in mezzanine loans at the stated principal amount net of
    any discount or premium. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    the carrying amounts of “mezzanine loans receivable” were
    $492,339,000 and $561,164,000, respectively. We accrete or
    amortize any discounts or premiums over the life of the related
    receivable utilizing the effective interest method, or straight-line
    method if the result is not materially different. We evaluate
    the collectibility of both interest and principal of each
    of our loans, if circumstances warrant, to determine whether
    they are impaired. A loan is impaired when, based on current
    information and events, it is probable that we will be unable
    to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual
    terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual
    is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment
    to the value determined by discounting the expected future
cash flows at the loan’s effective interest rate or, as
a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the
loan is collateral dependent. The impact of our estimates in
connection with the collectibility of both interest and principal
of our loans could be material to our consolidated financial
statements.

Partially Owned Entities

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying amounts of investments and advances to partially owned entities, including Alexander’s and Toys “R” Us, were $1.517 billion and $1.453 billion, respectively. In determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we will absorb the majority of the entity’s expected losses, if they occur, or receive the majority of the expected residual returns, if they occur, or both. We account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met,
and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method.

Our investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment, periodically, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary.

Allowance For Doubtful Accounts

We periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts ($23,177,000 and $17,727,000 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents ($3,076,000 and $2,334,000 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006). This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.


Critical Accounting Policies – continued

Revenue Recognition

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:

•

Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.  We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use.  In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

•

Percentage Rent — income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold. These rents are recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104:

Revenue Recognition

, which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., sales thresholds have been achieved).

•

Hotel Revenue — income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered.

•

Trade Shows Revenue — income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred.

•

Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.

•

Temperature Controlled Logistics Revenue – income arising from our investment in Americold. Storage and handling revenue are recognized as services are provided. Transportation fees are recognized upon delivery to customers.

•

Management, Leasing and Other Fees – income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.

Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among other things, its collectibility. If our assessment of the collectibility of our revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material.

Income Taxes

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, or fail to meet other REIT requirements, we may fail to qualify as a REIT and substantial adverse tax consequences may result.


Recently Issued Accounting Literature

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”).

SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008.  The FASB has deferred the implementation of the provisions of SFAS 157 relating to certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities until January 1, 2009. SFAS 157 is not expected to materially affect how we determine fair value, but may result in certain additional disclosures.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158,

Employer’s Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of SFAS No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R

(“SFAS 158”).  SFAS 158 requires an employer to (i) recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan’s over-funded status or a liability for a plan’s under-funded status; (ii) measure a plan’s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (iii) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur.  Those changes will be reported in comprehensive income.  The adoption of the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure
requirements as of December 31, 2006 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.  The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations to determine the funded status as of the end of the fiscal year and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur is effective on January 1, 2009. The adoption of the measurement date provisions of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.  SFAS 159 is effective for us on January 1, 2008.  We have not elected the fair value option for any of our existing financial instruments on the effective date and have not determined whether or not we will elect this option for any eligible financial instruments we acquire in the future.

On August 31, 2007, the FASB issued a proposed FASB Staff Position (the “proposed FSP”) that affects the accounting for our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures and Series D-13 convertible preferred units.  The proposed FSP requires the initial proceeds from the sale of our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures and Series D-13 convertible preferred units to be allocated between a liability component and an equity component.  The resulting discount must be amortized using the effective interest method over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding as additional interest expense.  If adopted, we expect that the proposed FSP would be effective for our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2009 and would require retroactive application.  The adoption of the proposed FSP on January 1, 2009 would result in the recognition of an aggregate unamortized debt
discount of $180,429,000 (as of December 31, 2007) on our consolidated balance sheet and additional interest expense on our consolidated statements of income.  Our current estimate of the incremental interest expense, net of minority interest, for each reporting period is as follows:

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141R,

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141R”).  SFAS 141R broadens the guidance of SFAS 141, extending its applicability to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. It broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and interests transferred as a result of business combinations; and stipulates that acquisition related costs be expensed rather than included as part of the basis of the acquisition.  SFAS 141R expands required disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for all transactions entered into on or after January 1, 2009.  The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 could materially impact
our future financial results to the extent that we acquire significant amounts of real estate, as related acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred compared to our current practice of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life of the assets acquired.

In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - An Amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS 160”).  SFAS 160 requires a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be identified in the consolidated financial statements.  SFAS 160 also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parent’s ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation. SFAS 160 is effective on January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact SFAS 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Net income and EBITDA

(1)

by Segment for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 – continued

Notes to the preceding tabular information:

(1)

EBITDA represents “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.”  Management considers EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the un-levered performance of its segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)

Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax (benefit) expense in the reconciliation of net income to EBITDA include our share of these items from partially owned entities.

Results of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to December 31, 2006 – continued

Notes to preceding tabular information:

($ in thousands, except revenue per available room statistics)

(1)

Average occupancy and revenue per available room (“REVPAR”) were 84.4% and $130.70 for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 82.1% and $109.53 in the prior year.

(2)

Primarily from (i) a $34,782 increase in transportation operations (resulting in a $1,640 increase in EBITDA) resulting from new transportation business in connection with the acquisition of the ConAgra warehouses in the fourth quarter of 2006, (ii) a $7,967 increase in managed warehouse operations (resulting in a $314 increase in EBITDA) as a result of a new management contract beginning in March 2007, and (iii) a $5,273 increase in owned warehouse operations.  See note 3 on page 91 for a discussion on AmeriCold’s gross margin.

(3)

Primarily due to lease termination fee income received from MONY Life Insurance Company in 2006 in connection with the termination of their 289,000 square foot lease at 1740 Broadway.

(4)

Results from the elimination of inter-company fees from operating segments upon consolidation.  See note 4 on page 91.

Results of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to December 31, 2006 – continued

Notes to preceding tabular information:

($ in thousands)

(1)

Primarily from a (i) $13,885 increase in operating expenses of Building Maintenance Services, Inc. (“BMS”), a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering services to New York Office properties (the corresponding increase in BMS revenues is included in “other income”), (ii) $8,992 increase in property level costs and (iii) $7,553 write-off of straight line rent receivable in connection with lease terminations.

(2)

Primarily from (i) a $7,782 increase in property level operating costs, (ii) $2,000 due to a reassessment of 2006 real estate taxes in 2007 and (iii) a $4,050 reversal of a reserve for bad debts in 2006.

(3)

AmeriCold’s gross margin from comparable warehouses was $155,824, or 33.6% for 2007, compared to $149,932, or 32.2% for 2006.

(4)

Represents the elimination of inter-company fees from operating segments upon consolidation.  See note 4 on page 89.

(5)

H Street litigation costs in 2006.

(6)

Primarily from a decrease in corporate overhead.

(7)

Primarily from (i) $4,835 of administrative and organization expenses of the India Property Fund, in which we are a 50.6% partner as of December 31, 2007 (because we consolidate the India Property Fund, the minority share of these expenses is included in minority interest on our consolidated statement of income), and (ii) $1,880 of general and administrative expenses of 555 California Street from the date of acquisition.

(8)

Primarily from a (i) $5,465 decrease in franchise taxes and donations, (ii) $4,420 decrease in medicare taxes resulting from stock option exercises and the termination of a rabbi trust, partially offset by, (iii) an $8,245 increase in stock-based compensation.

Income Applicable to Alexander’s

Income
    applicable to Alexander’s (loan interest income, management,
    leasing, development and commitment fees, and equity in income)
    was $50,589,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared
    to a loss of $14,530,000 for the prior year, an increase
    of $65,119,000. The increase was primarily due to (i) our
    $14,280,000 share of income in 2007 for the reversal of accrued
    stock appreciation rights compensation expense as compared
    to $49,043,000 for our share of expense in the prior year,
    (ii) an increase of $3,504,000 in our equity in earnings
    of Alexander’s before stock appreciation rights and
    net gains on sales of condominiums, (iii) an increase of
    $3,758,000 in development fees in 2007, partially offset
    by (iv) our $4,580,000 share of Alexander’s net gain
    on sale of 731 Lexington Avenue condominiums in the prior
    year and (v) a $1,305,000 decrease in leasing fee income.

Loss Applicable to Toys

Our 32.7% share of Toys’ financial results (comprised of our share of Toys’ net loss, interest income on loans receivable, and management fees) for the years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 are for Toys fiscal periods from October 29, 2006 to November 3, 2007 and October 30, 2005 to October 28, 2006, respectively.  In the year ended December 31, 2007, our loss applicable to Toys was $14,337,000, or $25,235,000 before our share of Toys’ income tax benefit, as compared to $47,520,000 or $70,147,000 before our share of Toys’ income tax benefit in the prior year.  The decrease in our loss applicable to Toys’ before income tax benefit of $44,912,000 results primarily from (i) an increase in Toys’ net sales due to improvements in comparable store sales across all divisions and benefits in foreign currency translation, (ii) a net gain related to a lease
termination, (iii) decreased interest expense primarily due to reduced borrowings and reduced amortization of deferred financing costs, partially offset by, (iv) an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, which as a percentage of net sales were 27.7% and 26.4% for the twelve month periods ended November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006, respectively, as a result of higher payroll, store occupancy, corporate and advertising expenses.

__________________________

(1)

On April 30, 2007, we acquired the corporations that own the remaining 50% interest in these assets and we now consolidate the accounts of these entities into our consolidated financial statements and no longer account for them under the equity method.  Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2006 these corporations were contesting our acquisition of H Street and impeded our access to their financial information.  Accordingly, we were unable to record our pro rata share of their earnings.  2006 includes $3,890 for our 50% share of their earnings for the period from July 20, 2005 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2005.

(2)

We record our pro rata share of GMH’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that GCT files its financial statements.  On July 31, 2006 GCT filed its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, which restated the quarterly financial results of each of the first three quarters of 2005.  On September 15, 2006 GCT filed its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006.  Accordingly, “equity in net income or loss from partially owned entities” for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes a net loss of $1,013, which consists of (i) a $94 net loss representing our share of GMH’s 2005 fourth quarter results, including adjustments to restate its first three quarters of 2005 and (ii) a
net loss of $919 for our share of GMH’s earnings through September 30, 2006.

(3)

On January 1, 2007, we began recording our pro rata share of Lexington MLP’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that Lexington files its financial statements.  Prior to the January 1, 2007, we recorded our pro rata share of Newkirk MLP’s (Lexington MLP’s predecessor) quarterly earnings current in our same quarter. Accordingly, our “equity in net income or loss from partially owned entities” for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes our share of Lexington MLP’s net income or loss for the nine month period from January 1, 2007 through September 30, 2007.

The
          decrease in our share of earnings from the prior year
          is primarily due to (i) the current year including
          our share of Lexington MLP’s first, second and
          third quarter results (lag basis) compared to the prior
          year including our share of
          Newkirk MLP’s full year results, (ii) higher depreciation
          expense and amortization of above market lease intangibles
          in the current year as a result of Lexington’s
          purchase price accounting adjustments in connection
          with the merger of Newkirk MLP on December 31, 2006,
          (iii) $10,842 for our share of net gains on sale of
          real estate in 2006 and (iv) a $10,362 net gain recognized
          in 2006 as a result of the acquisition of Newkirk by
          Lexington.

(4)

Includes
                our equity in net earnings of partially owned
                entities, including partially owned office buildings
                in New York and Washington, DC, the Monmouth
                Mall, Dune Capital LP, Verde Group LLC, and others.

    to $262,176,000 in the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease
    of $33,677,000. This decrease resulted primarily from the

Interest and Debt Expense

Interest and debt expense was $634,554,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $476,461,000 in the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $158,093,000.  This increase was primarily due to (i) $80,255,000 from approximately $1.713 billion of mortgage financings and refinancings on our existing property portfolio during 2007 and 2006, (ii) $67,780,000 from a $1.754 billion of mortgage debt resulting from property acquisitions, (iii) $70,432,000 from senior unsecured financings, including $1.0 billion issued in November 2006 and $1.4 billion issued in March 2007, partially offset by, (iv) an increase of $28,240,000 in the amount of capitalized interest relating to a larger amount of assets under development in 2007, (v) $25,119,000 of expense in 2006 from early extinguishments of debt, and (vi) $19,344,000 less interest in 2007 from the redemption of $500,000,000 of senior
unsecured notes in May 2007.

Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate

Net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate was $39,493,000 and $76,073,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and consists primarily of net gains from sales of marketable equity securities, including $23,090,000 from the sale of McDonalds common shares in 2007 and $55,438,000 from the sale of Sears Canada common shares in 2006.

Minority Interest of Partially Owned Entities

Minority interest of partially owned entities was income of $18,559,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to income of $20,173,000 in the prior year, a change of $1,614,000.  Minority interest of partially owned entities represents the minority partners’ pro rata share of the net income or loss of consolidated partially owned entities, including 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 555 California Street, Americold Realty Trust, India Property Fund, 220 Central Park South, Wasserman and the Springfield Mall.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $10,530,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $2,326,000 for the prior year, an increase of $8,204,000.  This increase results primarily from (i) the consolidation of two H Street corporations beginning on April 30, 2007, the date we acquired the remaining 50% of these corporations we did not previously own (we previously accounted for our 50% investment on the equity method) and (ii) $4,622,000 of Federal withholding tax on dividends paid to foreign corporations in connection with 1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street, which we acquired in May 2007.

In connection with purchase accounting for H Street, in July 2005 and April 2007 we recorded an aggregate of $220,000,000 of deferred tax liabilities for the differences between the tax basis and the book basis of the acquired assets and liabilities.  We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of February 2008, we have completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008.  Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, the deferred tax liabilities will be eliminated and we will recognize $220,000,000 as an income tax benefit on our consolidated statement of income.

Discontinued Operations

Income
    from discontinued operations in the table below represents
    the combined net income and net gains on sales of real estate,
    net of minority interest, of the assets that are classified
    as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets. These
    assets include 19.6 acres of land we acquired as part of
    our acquisition of H Street, of which 11 acres were sold
    in September 2007; Vineland, New Jersey, which was sold on
    July 16, 2007; Crystal Mall Two, which was sold on August
    9, 2007; Arlington Plaza, which was sold on October 17, 2007;
    33 North Dearborn Street in Chicago, Illinois, which was
    sold on March 14, 2006; 424 Sixth Avenue in New York City,
    which was sold on March 13, 2006 and 1919 South Eads Street
    in Arlington, Virginia, which was sold on June 22, 2006.

Minority Limited Partners’ Interest in the Operating Partnership

Minority limited partners’ interest
    in the Operating Partnership was $47,508,000 for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 compared to $58,712,000 for the prior
    year, a decrease of $11,204,000. This decrease results primarily
    from a lower minority ownership in the Operating Partnership
    due to the conversion of Class A Operating Partnership units
into our common shares during 2007 and 2006.

Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions of the Operating Partnership

Perpetual preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership were $19,274,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $21,848,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $2,574,000. This decrease resulted primarily from the redemption of $45,000,000 Series D-9 preferred units and the write-off of $1,125,000 of Series D-9 issuance costs in October 2006.

Preferred Share Dividends

Preferred share dividends were $57,177,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $57,511,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $334,000.

Results of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to December 31, 2005 – continued

Notes to preceding tabular information:

(1)

From our acquisition of trade show operations in Canada in November 2006.

(2)

Average occupancy and revenue per available room (“REVPAR”) were 82.1% and $109.53 for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 83.7% and $96.85 in the prior year.

(3)

Primarily from $76,300 of transportation management services revenue in 2005 from a government agency for transportation services in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina, partially offset by a $10,300 increase in other transportation revenue.   See note 4 on page 99 for a discussion of Americold’s gross margin.

(4)

Primarily from the acceleration of lease termination fees from MONY Life Insurance Company upon the termination of their 289,000 square foot lease at 1740 Broadway.

(5)

Primarily from lease termination income of $13,362 received from HIP at 7 West 34

th

Street in January 2005.

(6)

Reflects an increase in rentals and a reduction in leasing and management fees as a result of acquiring the Warner and Bowen buildings, which were previously partially owned and presented as managed for third parties.

(7)

Includes cleaning fees charged by BMS, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the New York Office division, to certain wholly-owned properties included in the Washington, DC Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart divisions.  The elimination of these inter-company fees is shown in the Other segment.

_________________________

(1)

From our acquisition of trade show operations in Canada in November 2006.

(2)

Primarily from higher marketing expenses for trade shows held in 2006.

(3)

Primarily from a reversal of $3,040 in allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents due to a change in estimate during the second quarter of 2006.

(4)

Primarily from $60,300 of transportation management services operating expenses in 2005 related to the services provided to a government agency in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina, partially offset by a $16,000 increase in warehouse operating expenses, primarily due to an increase in utility rates.  Americold’s gross margin from owned warehouses was $150,000, or 31.2% for 2006, compared to $159,900, or 33.7% for 2005.  The decrease in gross margin from owned warehouses was primarily due to higher facility costs as noted above.  Gross margin from transportation management services, managed warehouses and other non-warehouse activities was $8,400, or 2.8% for 2006, compared to $24,300, or 6.5% for 2005, a $15,900 decrease.  This decrease was primarily due to higher transportation revenues in 2005 as noted above.

(5)

The increase in corporate general and administrative expense results primarily from (i) $7,405 of amortization of stock-based compensation, including the 2006 Out-Performance Plan, stock option awards and restricted stock awards, (ii) $5,800 for our share of medicare taxes resulting from stock option exercises and the termination of a rabbi trust, (iii) an increase of $2,267 in professional fees, (iv) $2,299 from write-offs of acquisitions not consummated and (v) an increase of $1,218 in deferred compensation expense due to an increase in the value of the deferred compensation plan, which is offset by an equal amount of investment income.

(Loss) Income Applicable to Alexander’s

Loss applicable to Alexander’s (loan interest income, management, leasing, development and commitment fees, and equity in income) was $14,530,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to income of $59,022,000 in 2005, a decrease of $73,552,000. The decrease is primarily due to (i) a reduction in Alexander’s net gain on sale of 731 Lexington Avenue condominiums, of which our share was $26,315,000, as all of the condominium units have been sold and closed, (ii) an increase in Alexander’s stock appreciation rights compensation (“SAR”) expense, of which our share was $39,939,000, (iii) a $5,517,000 reduction in development and guarantee fees, primarily because 731 Lexington Avenue project was completed in 2005, and (iv) $6,122,000 of interest income in the prior year on loans to Alexander’s that were repaid to us in July 2005, partially offset by, (v) an
increase in Alexander’s operating income, of which our share was $3,452,000.

Loss Applicable to Toys

In 2006, Toys closed 87 Toys “R” Us stores in the United States as a result of its store-closing program.  Toys incurred restructuring and other charges aggregating approximately $127,000,000 before tax, which includes $44,000,000 for the cost of liquidating the inventory. Our share of the $127,000,000 charge was $42,000,000, of which $27,300,000 had no income statement effect as a result of purchase accounting and the remaining portion relating to the cost of liquidating inventory of approximately $9,100,000 after-tax, was recognized as an expense as part of our equity in Toys’ net income in 2006.

We recorded a net loss of $47,520,000 from our investment in Toys for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to a net loss of $40,496,000 in 2005.  The net loss in the current year consisted of (i) our $56,219,000 share of Toys’ net loss for the period from October 30, 2005 to October 28, 2006, which excludes our $9,377,000 share of the net gain recognized by Toys on the sale of 37 Toys “R” Us stores to us on October 16, 2006, which was recorded as an adjustment to the basis of our investment, partially offset by, (ii) $5,731,000 of interest income from our share of Toys’ senior unsecured bridge loan and (iii) $2,968,000 of management fees. The net loss in 2005 consisted of (i) our $46,789,000 share of Toys’ net loss for the period ended July 21, 2005 (date of our acquisition) to October 29, 2005, partially offset by (ii) $5,043,000 of interest from our share
of Toys’ senior unsecured bridge loan and (iii) $1,250,000 of management fees.

The unaudited information set forth below presents our pro forma condensed consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2005 (including Toys’ results for the twelve months ended October 29, 2005) as if the above transaction occurred on February 1, 2004.  The unaudited pro forma information below is not necessarily indicative of what our actual results would have been had the Toys transaction been consummated on February 1, 2004, nor does it represent the results of operations for any future periods. In our opinion, all adjustments necessary to reflect this transaction have been made.

2006 includes (i) a $10,362 net gain recognized as a result of the acquisition of Newkirk by Lexington and (ii) $10,842 for our share of net gains on sale of real estate.  2005 includes (i) $9,445 for our share of losses on the early extinguishment of debt and write-off of related deferred financing costs, (ii) $6,602 for our share of impairment losses, partially offset by (iii) $4,236 for our share of net gains on sale of real estate. Excluding the above items, our share of Newkirk MLP’s 2006 net income was $8,750 lower than 2005, primarily as a result of asset sales.

(2)

2005 includes $16,053 for our share of net gains on disposition of T-2 assets, partially offset by $8,470 for our share of expense from payment of promoted obligations to partner.

(3)

In 2006, we accounted for H Street partially owned entities on the equity method on a one-quarter lag basis. Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2006, two 50% owned entities that were contesting our acquisition of H Street impeded our access to their financial information and accordingly, we were unable to record our pro rata share of their earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2006, based on the financial information provided to us, we recognized equity in net income of $11,074 from these entities, of which $3,890 was for the period from July 20, 2005 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2005.

(4)

We
                account for our investment in GMH on the equity
                method and record our pro rata share of GMH’s
                net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis
                as we file our consolidated financial statements
                on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that
                GCT files its financial statements. On July 31,
                2006 GCT filed its annual report on Form 10-K
                for the year ended December 31, 2005, which restated
                the quarterly financial results of each of the
                first three quarters of 2005. Accordingly, we
                recognized a net loss of $1,013 for the year
                ended December 31, 2006 for our share of GMH’s
                earnings from October 1, 2005 through September
                30, 2006. Of this amount, $94 represents our
                share of GMH’s 2005 fourth quarter net loss,
                including adjustments to restate its first three
                quarters of 2005.

(5)

Includes
                our equity in net earnings of partially owned
                entities, including partially owned office buildings
                in New York and Washington, DC, the Monmouth
                Mall, Dune Capital LP, Verde Group LLC, and others.

(6)

Includes $2,173 for a prepayment penalty from the Monmouth Mall venture in August 2005 upon the repayment of our initial preferred equity investment.

This increase was primarily due to (i) $69,200,000 from a $3.2 billion increase in outstanding debt due to property acquisitions and refinancings, (ii) $13,000,000 from a 117 basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate on variable rate of debt, (iii) $12,300,000 from the February 16, 2006 issuance of $250,000,000 unsecured notes due 2011, (iv) $33,400,000 for loan defeasance costs and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, partially offset by, (v) $10,614,000 of an increase in the amount of capitalized interest relating to a larger amount of assets under development during 2006.

On March 14, 2006, we sold 33 North Dearborn Street, a 336,000 square foot office building located in Chicago, Illinois, for $46,000,000, which resulted in a net gain of $4,835,000.

On June 22, 2006, we sold 1919 South Eads Street, a 96,000 square foot office building located in Arlington, Virginia for $38,400,000, which resulted in a net gain of $17,609,000.

Minority limited partners’ interest in the Operating Partnership was $58,712,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $66,755,000 in 2005, a decrease of $8,043,000. This decrease results primarily from a lower minority ownership in the Operating Partnership due to the conversion of Class A Operating Partnership units into our common shares during 2006 and 2005.

Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions of the Operating Partnership

Perpetual preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership were $21,848,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $67,119,000 in 2005, a decrease of $45,271,000. This decrease resulted primarily from the redemption of an aggregate of $742,000,000 8.25% Series D preferred units (Series D-3 through D-9) during 2005 and 2006, partially offset by the issuance of $100,000,000 6.75% D-14 units in September 2005 and the issuance of the $45,000,000 6.875% D-15 units in May and August 2006.

This increase resulted primarily from dividends paid on the 6.75% Series H and 6.625% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares which were issued in June 2005 and August 2005, respectively, partially offset by a $3,852,000 write-off of issuance costs in the first quarter of 2005 related to the redemption of the Series C preferred shares.

Supplemental Information – continued

Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2007 and September 30, 2007 – continued

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarter-by-quarter net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys’ fourth quarter net income, which we recorded on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of Toys’ fiscal year net income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the third quarter of the year. The Merchandise Mart segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage rental income. The Temperature Controlled Logistics segment has experienced higher earnings in the fourth quarter due to higher
activity and occupancy in its warehouse operations due to the holiday season’s impact on the food industry.

Related Party Transactions

Loans and Compensation Agreements

On November 30, 2006, Michael Fascitelli, our President, repaid to the Company his $8,600,000 outstanding loan which was scheduled to mature in December 2006.  The loan was made to him in 1996 pursuant to his employment agreement.

On December 31, 2006, 1,546,106 shares held in a rabbi trust, established for deferred compensation purposes as part of Mr. Fascitelli’s 1996 and 2001 employment agreements, were distributed to Mr. Fascitelli, net of 739,130 shares which were used to satisfy the resulting tax withholding obligation.  The shares we received for the tax liability were retired upon receipt.

On March 26, 2007, Joseph Macnow, Executive Vice President – Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, repaid to the Company his $2,000,000 outstanding loan which was scheduled to mature June 2007.

Effective as of April 19, 2007, we entered into a new employment agreement with Mitchell Schear, the President of our Washington, DC Office Division.  This agreement, which replaced his prior agreement, was approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Trustees and provides for a term of five years and is automatically renewable for one-year terms thereafter.  The agreement also provides for a minimum salary of $1,000,000 per year and bonuses and other customary benefits.  Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on April 19, 2007, the Compensation Committee granted options to Mr. Schear to acquire 200,000 of our common shares at an exercise price of $119.94 per share.  These options vest ratably over three years beginning in 2010 and accelerate on a change of control or if we terminate his employment without cause or by him for breach by us.  The agreement also provides that if we
terminate Mr. Schear’s employment without cause or by him for breach by us, he will receive a lump-sum payment equal to one year’s salary and bonus, up to a maximum of $2,000,000.

Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees

Alexander’s

We own 32.8% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President, are officers and directors of Alexander’s.  We provide various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements.  These agreements are described in Note 6 - Investments in Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.

On January 10, 2006, the Omnibus Stock Plan Committee of the Board of Directors of Alexander’s granted Mr. Fascitelli a SAR covering 350,000 shares of Alexander’s common stock. The exercise price of the SAR is $243.83 per share of common stock, which was the average of the high and low trading price of Alexander’s common stock on date of grant. The SAR became exercisable on July 10, 2006, provided Mr. Fascitelli is employed with Alexander’s on such date, and was set to expire on March 14, 2007. Mr. Fascitelli’s early exercise and Alexander’s related tax consequences were factors in Alexander’s decision to make the new grant to him.  On March 13, 2007, Michael Fascitelli, our President of Alexander’s, exercised 350,000 of his SARS and received $144.18 for each SAR exercised representing the difference between Alexander’s stock price
of $388.01 (the average of the high and low market price) on the date of exercise and the exercise price of $243.83.


Related Party Transactions – continued

Interstate Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Steven Roth, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s, are Interstate’s two other partners. As of December 31, 2007, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned approximately 8.3% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 27.2% of Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days’ notice at the end of the term. We believe based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies that the management agreement terms are fair to us. We earned $800,000, $798,000 and $791,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Other

On April 13, 2006, we acquired the 92.65% interest that we did not already own of 1999 K Street, located in the Central Business District of Washington, DC. The purchase price for the 92.65% interest was $52,800,000, consisting of $34,600,000 in cash and $18,200,000 of existing mortgage debt.  Mitchell N. Schear, President of our Washington, DC Office division, received $3,675,000 for his share of the proceeds as a partner of the selling entity.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures.  Capital requirements for significant acquisitions and development expenditures may require funding from borrowings and/or equity offerings.

Acquisitions and Investments

We completed approximately $4,045,400,000 of real estate acquisitions and investments in 2007 and $1,650,559,000 in 2006.  In addition, we made $217,081,000 of mezzanine loans during 2007 and $363,374,000 in 2006.  These acquisitions and investments were consummated through our subsidiaries and were financed with available cash, mortgage indebtedness, and/or the issuance of operating partnership equity. The related assets, liabilities and results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Excluding our acquisition of a 70% interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street in May 2007, the pro forma effect of the acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our historical consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.  Details of our 2007
acquisitions and investments are summarized in the Overview of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Details of our 2006 acquisitions and investments are summarized below.

San Francisco Bay Area Properties

On January 10, 2006, we acquired four properties for $72,000,000 in cash. The properties are located in the San Francisco Bay area and contain a total of 189,000 square feet of retail and office space.  We consolidate the accounts of these properties into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

Springfield Mall, Virginia

On January 31, 2006, we acquired an option to purchase the Springfield Mall for $35,600,000, of which we paid $14,000,000 in cash upon closing and $13,200,000 in installments through December 31, 2007.  The remainder of $8,400,000 will be paid in installments over the next two years.  The mall, located on 79 acres at the intersection of Interstate 95 and Franconia Road in Springfield, Virginia, contains 1.4 million square feet and is anchored by Macy’s, and J.C. Penney and Target who own their stores aggregating 389,000 square feet.  We intend to redevelop, reposition and re-tenant the mall. The option becomes exercisable upon the passing of one of the existing principals of the selling entity and may be deferred at our election through November 2012. Upon exercise of the option, we will pay $80,000,000 to acquire the mall, subject to the existing mortgage of $180,000,000, which will be
amortized to $149,000,000 at maturity in 2013. Upon closing of the option on January 31, 2006, we acquired effective control of the mall, including management of the mall and right to the mall’s net cash flow. Accordingly, we consolidate the accounts of the mall into our consolidated financial statements pursuant to the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

(“FIN 46R”). We have a 2.5% minority partner in this transaction.

San Jose, California Ground-up Development

On
    March 29, 2006, a joint venture, in which we have a 45% equity
    interest and are a co-managing partner, acquired 55 acres
    of land in San Jose, California for $59,600,000. The purchase
    price was funded with $20,643,000 of cash contributed by
    the partners, of which our share was $9,289,000, and $38,957,000
    drawn on a $117,000,000 acquisition/construction loan, the
    balance of which will be used to fund the development of
    325,000 square feet of retail space and site work for Home
    Depot and Target who will construct their own stores. As
    of December 31, 2007, a total of $101,045,000 has been drawn
    under the loan. Upon completion of the development we have
    an option to acquire our partner’s 55% equity interest
    at a 7% unlevered yield. We account for our investment in
    this joint venture on the equity method.

1999 K Street, Washington, DC

On October 16, 2006, we completed the first phase of the agreement by acquiring 37 stores for $171,000,000 in cash.  All of these stores were part of the store closing program announced by Toys in January 2006.  We consolidate the accounts of these properties into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.  Our $9,377,000 share of Toys’ net gain on this transaction was recorded as an adjustment to the basis of our investment in Toys and was not recorded as income.

Tenant improvements and leasing commissions per square foot budgeted for 2008 leasing activity are $57.25 ($3.82 per annum) and $18.74 ($3.75 per annum) for Merchandise Mart office and showroom space, respectively.

The table above excludes anticipated capital expenditures of non-consolidated entities, including Alexander’s and Toy’s, as these entities will fund their own capital expenditures without additional equity contributions from us.

Dividends and Distributions

Based on fourth quarter 2007 dividend rates, we anticipate that the Operating Partnership will make distributions in 2008 aggregating approximately $688,000,000 to its unitholders.  Of this amount, approximately $608,000,000 will be distributed directly to us, as the majority owner of such units, and we, in turn, will distribute 100% of such amount in the form of common and preferred dividends to our shareholders.

We may seek to obtain additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings or asset sales, although there is no express policy with respect thereto. We may also offer our shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise re-acquire our shares or any other securities in the future.

We believe that we have complied with the financial covenants required by our revolving credit facilities and our senior unsecured notes, and that as of December 31, 2007 we have the ability to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness.  We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity securities and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a “well-known seasoned issuer.”

At December 31, 2007, our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility had $49,788,000 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. Our revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants, which require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. At December 31, 2007, Americold’s $30,000,000 revolving credit facility had $19,086,000 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. This facility requires Americold to maintain, on a trailing four-quarter basis, a minimum of $30,000,000 of free cash flow, as defined. Our revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items
as failure to pay interest or principal.

During 2007, we completed approximately $1.400 billion of senior unsecured financings and $1.111 billion of property level mortgage financings and repaid $912,674,000 of existing debt.  During 2006, we completed approximately $1.250 billion of senior unsecured financings and $3.689 billion of property level mortgage financings and repaid $1.848 billion of existing debt.  In addition, during 2006, we issued approximately $1.004 billion of common shares and $43,819,000 of preferred shares.  The net proceeds we received from 2007 and 2006 financings were used primarily to fund acquisitions and investments and for general corporate purposes, unless otherwise noted.  Details of our 2007 financing activities are summarized in the Overview of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Details of our 2006 financing activities are summarized below.


Liquidity and Capital Resources – continued

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations – continued

On February 16, 2006, we completed a public offering of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.6% senior unsecured notes due February 15, 2011. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, commencing August 16, 2006. The notes were priced at 99.906% of their face amount to yield 5.622%. The net proceeds of approximately $248,000,000 were used for general corporate purposes.

On May 2, 2006, we sold 1,400,000 6.875% Series D-15 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership at a price of $25.00 per unit. On August 17, 2006 we sold an additional 400,000 Series D-15 Units at a price of $25.00 per unit, for a combined total of 1,800,000 Series D-15 units and net proceeds of $43,875,000. The net proceeds received were used for general corporate purposes.  We may redeem the Series D-15 Units at a price of $25.00 per unit after May 2, 2011.

On June 28, 2006, we entered into a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which replaced our previous $600,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility that was due to mature in July 2006. The new facility has a four-year term, with a one-year extension option and bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.55% (5.70% as of December 31, 2007).

On July 28, 2006, we called for redemption of the 8.25% Series D-9 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. The Preferred Units were redeemed on September 21, 2006 at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per unit or an aggregate of $45,000,000 plus accrued distributions. In conjunction with the redemption, we expensed $1,125,000 of issuance costs in 2006.

On November 20, 2006, we sold $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.625% convertible senior debentures due 2026, pursuant to an effective registration statement.  The aggregate net proceeds from this offering, after underwriters’ discounts and expenses, were approximately $980,000,000.  The debentures are convertible, under certain circumstances, for common shares of Vornado Realty Trust at an initial conversion rate of 6.5168 common shares per $1,000 of principal amount of debentures. The initial conversion price of $153.45 represented a premium of 30% over the November 14, 2006 closing price for our common shares.  The debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in 2011 for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures in 2011, 2016, and 2021 and in the event of a change in
control.  The net proceeds of the offering were contributed to the Operating Partnership in the form of an inter-company loan and the Operating Partnership guaranteed the payment of the debentures.  The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds primarily for acquisitions and investments and for general corporate purposes.

On December 11, 2006, we sold 8,100,000 common shares in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement at a price of $124.05 per share.  We received net proceeds of approximately $1,004,500,000, after offering expenses and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 8,100,000 Class A units of the Operating Partnership.

Insurance

We carry commercial liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) “acts of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (“TRIPRA”), which expires in December 2014, and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to our assets. Our New York Office, Washington, DC Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart divisions have $1.5 billion of per occurrence all risk property insurance coverage, including terrorism coverage, in effect through September 15, 2008.  AmeriCold has $250,000,000 of per occurrence all risk property insurance coverage, including terrorism coverage, in effect through January 1, 2009.   Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $150,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, and a
$150,000,000 annual aggregate limit.

In June 2007 we formed Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, to act as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage and as a direct insurer for coverage for “certified” acts of terrorism and for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by TRIPRA.  Coverage for “certified” acts
    of terrorism is fully reinsured by third party insurance
    companies and the Federal government with no exposure to
    PPIC. Prior to the formation of PPIC, we were uninsured for
    losses under NBCR coverage. Subsequently, we have $1.5 billion
    of NBCR coverage under TRIPRA, for which PPIC is responsible
    for 15% of each NBCR loss and the insurance company deductible
    of $1,000,000. We are ultimately responsible for any loss
borne by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties (which are generally non-recourse to us), senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance and/or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey claiming we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the motions for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Court’s decision.  On December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Court’s decision.  On January 16, 2007, we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Court’s decision which was denied on March 13, 2007.  We are currently engaged in discovery and
anticipate that a trial date will be set for some time in 2008.  We intend to vigorously pursue our claims against Stop & Shop.  In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We have made acquisitions and investments in partially owned entities for which we are committed to fund additional capital aggregating $167,389,000 as of December 31, 2007. Of this amount, $115,000,000 relates to our equity commitment to the India Property Fund, L.P., and $21,800,000 relates to capital expenditures committed to the Springfield Mall, in which we have a 97.5% interest.

On November 10, 2005, we committed to fund the junior portion of up to $30,530,000 of a $173,000,000 construction loan to an entity developing a mixed-use building complex in Boston, Massachusetts, at the north end of the Boston Harbor. We earn current-pay interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 11%. The loan matures in November 2008, with a one-year extension option. As of December 31, 2007, we have funded $18,912,000 of this commitment.

We enter into agreements for the purchase and resale of U.S. government obligations for periods of up to one week. The obligations purchased under these agreements are held in safekeeping in our name by various money center banks. We have the right to demand additional collateral or return of these invested funds at any time the collateral value is less than 102% of the invested funds plus any accrued earnings thereon. We had $82,240,000 and $219,990,000 of cash invested in these agreements at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

On January 16, 2008, our Board of Trustees approved the termination of the Vornado Realty Trust Employees Retirement Plan and the Merchandise Mart Properties Pension Plan.  These plans were frozen in 1998 and 1999, respectively.  Our current estimate of the cost we will incur during 2008 to buy annuities from an insurance company or to make lump-sum payments to plan participants to terminate both plans is approximately $4,000,000.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

From time to time, we have disposed of substantial amounts of real estate to third parties for which, as to certain properties, we remain contingently liable for rent payments or mortgage indebtedness that we cannot quantify.

Cash Flow for the Year Ended December 31, 2007

Property rental income represents our primary source of net cash provided by operating activities.  Property rental income is primarily dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties.   Other sources of liquidity to fund our cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans and corporate level unsecured borrowings; an aggregate of $2.6 billion of revolving credit; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity; and asset sales.  Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership and distributions to common and preferred shareholders, as well as acquisition and development costs.

This increase resulted primarily from debt associated with asset acquisitions, property financings and refinancings and from the issuance of $1.0 billion of senior unsecured convertible debentures during 2007.  As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, $405,684,000 and $0, respectively, was outstanding under our revolving credit facilities.  During 2008 and 2009, $470,160,000 and $660,819,000 of our outstanding debt matures, respectively. We may refinance such debt or choose to repay all or a portion, using existing cash balances or our revolving credit facility.

Our share of debt of unconsolidated subsidiaries was $3,289,873,000 at December 31, 2007, a $33,134,000 decrease from the balance at December 31, 2006.

Funds From Operations (“FFO”)

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs. FFO and FFO per diluted share should be evaluated along with GAAP net income and income per diluted share (the most directly comparable GAAP measures),
as well as cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating performance of equity REITs. Management believes that FFO and FFO per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, these non-GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in Our Statements of Cash Flows. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income
as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.  The calculations of both the numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note 17. Income per Share, in our notes to consolidated financial statements on page 190 of this annual report on Form 10-K.

FFO
    applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions was
    $966,638,000, or $5.89 per diluted share for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to $858,693,000, or $5.51 per
    diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2006. FFO applicable
    to common shares plus assumed conversions was $193,412,000
    or $1.18 per diluted share for the three months ended December
    31, 2007, compared to $211,812,000, or $1.34 per diluted
share for the three months ended December 31, 2006.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We have exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest rates on our consolidated and non-consolidated debt (all of which arises out of non-trading activity) is as follows:

We may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. As of December 31, 2007, variable rate debt with an aggregate principal amount of $404,990,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 6.18% was subject to LIBOR caps.  These caps are based on a notional amount of $412,000,000 and cap LIBOR at a weighted average rate of 6.34%.

As of December 31, 2007, we have investments in mezzanine loans with an aggregate carrying amount of $121,476,000 that are based on variable interest rates which partially mitigate our exposure to a change in interest rates on our variable rate debt.

Fair Value of Our Debt

The fair value of our debt at December 31, 2007 approximates its aggregate carrying amount, based on discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt.

Derivative Instruments

We have, and may in the future enter into, derivative positions that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Because these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from their mark-to-market at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in “interest and other investment income” on our consolidated statements of income. In addition, we are, and may in the future be, subject to additional expense based on the notional amount of the derivative positions and a specified spread over LIBOR. Because the market value of these instruments can vary significantly between periods, we may experience significant fluctuations in the amount of our investment income or expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005 we recognized net gains aggregating approximately $113,503,000, $153,208,000 and $73,953,000, respectively,
from these positions.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board of Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vornado Realty Trust (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Vornado Realty Trust at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vornado Realty Trust and its majority-owned subsidiary, Vornado Realty L.P. All significant inter-company amounts have been eliminated. We account for unconsolidated partially owned entities on the equity method of accounting.  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Significant Accounting Policies

Real Estate:

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly related to the acquisition, improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete. If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the undepreciated net book value of the property carried forward, exceeds the estimated fair value of redeveloped property, the excess is charged to expense.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the assets’ estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40 years. Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximate the useful lives of the assets. Additions to real estate include interest expense capitalized during construction of $53,648,000 and $26,195,000, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, and identified intangibles such as above and below market leases and acquired in-place leases and customer relationships) and acquired liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141:

Business Combinations

and SFAS No. 142:

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions
that may affect the property.

Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.  An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate cash flows over our anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis.  An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount over the discounted cash flows using an appropriate discount rate. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.  Holding properties over longer periods decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss.  If our anticipated holding periods change or estimated cash flows decline based on market conditions or
otherwise, an impairment loss may be recognized.

Partially Owned Entities:

In determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we will absorb the majority of the entity’s expected losses, if they occur, or receive the majority of the expected residual returns, if they occur, or both. We consolidate our 47.6% investment in Americold Realty Trust because we have the contractual right to appoint three out of five members of its board of trustees, and therefore determined that we have a controlling interest. We have
concluded that we do not control a partially owned entity, despite an ownership interest of 50% or greater, if the entity is not considered a variable interest entity and the approval of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect to major decisions, such as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange or other disposition of real property, the hiring of a chief executive officer, the commencement, compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or arbitration or the placement of new or additional financing secured by assets of the venture. This is the case with respect to our 50% interests in Monmouth Mall, MartParc Wells, MartParc Orleans, Beverly Connection, 478-486 Broadway, 968 Third Avenue, West 57

th

Street properties and 825 Seventh Avenue. We account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method
investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method.

Our investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment, periodically, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary.

Identified Intangibles and Goodwill:

We record acquired intangible assets (including above-market leases, customer relationships and in-place leases) and acquired intangible liabilities (including below market leases) at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. We amortize identified intangible assets and liabilities that are determined to have finite lives over the period the assets and liabilities are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.

The excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss for an asset group is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro-rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, unless the fair value of specific components of the reporting group are determinable without undue cost and effort.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets, a component of “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets, were $601,232,000 and $303,609,000, respectively. In addition, the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of “deferred credit” on our consolidated balance sheets, were $814,101,000 and $296,836,000, respectively.

Mezzanine Loans Receivable:

We invest in mezzanine loans to entities which have significant real estate assets.  These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate.  We record these investments at the stated principal amount net of any discount or premium. We accrete or amortize any discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan receivable utilizing the effective interest method, or straight-line method if the result is not materially different. We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans, if circumstances warrant, to determine whether they are impaired. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all
amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan’s effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.


VORNADO REALTY TRUST

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies – continued

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents do not include cash escrowed under loan agreements and cash restricted in connection with an officer’s deferred compensation payable. Cash and cash equivalents include repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government obligations totaling $82,240,000 and $219,990,000 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks which may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit of $100,000. We have not experienced any losses to date on our invested cash.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:

We periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents. This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates.

Marketable Securities:

We classify debt and equity securities which we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time as securities available-for-sale; equity securities we intend to buy and sell on a short term basis as trading securities; and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock investments which we intend to hold to maturity as securities held to maturity. Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale are included as a component of shareholders’ equity and other comprehensive income. Realized gains or losses on the sale of securities are recorded based on specific identification.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, our marketable securities had an aggregate cost of $311,444,000 and $229,600,000, and an aggregate fair value of $323,106,000 and $316,727,000, respectively.  In addition, at December 31, 2007 and 2006, $226,796,000 and $221,716,000, respectively, of the aggregate fair value of our marketable securities represent securities available for sale and $96,310,000 and $95,011,000, respectively, represent securities held to maturity. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, aggregate unrealized gains were $33,432,000 and $87,702,000, respectively, and aggregate unrealized losses were $21,771,000 and $131,000, respectively.

We evaluate our portfolio of marketable securities for impairment as of each reporting period.  For each of the securities in our portfolio with unrealized losses, we review the underlying cause of the decline in value and the estimated recovery period, as well as the severity and duration of the decline.  In our evaluation, we consider our ability and intent to hold these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for us to recover our cost basis.  We also evaluate the near-term prospects for each of these investments in relation to the severity and duration of the decline.   At December 31, 2007, the aggregate unrealized loss of $21,771,000 relates to marketable securities with an aggregate fair value of $100,137,000, none of which have been in an unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months.  We do not believe that the decline in value of any of these securities is
other-than-temporary at December 31, 2007.

Deferred Charges:

Direct financing costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements as a component of interest expense. Direct costs related to successful leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases. All other deferred charges are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, in accordance with the terms of the agreements to which they relate.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

We have estimated the fair value of all financial instruments reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at amounts which are based upon an interpretation of available market information and valuation methodologies (including discounted cash flow analyses with regard to fixed rate debt). As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of our consolidated debt approximates its carrying amount.  As of December 31, 2006, the carrying amount of our consolidated debt exceeded its fair value by approximately $90,356,000.  Such fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized upon disposition of our financial instruments.

Revenue Recognition:

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:

•

Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.  We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use.  In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

•

Percentage Rent — income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold. These rents are recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104:

Revenue Recognition

, which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., sales thresholds have been achieved).

•

Hotel Revenue — income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue is recognized when the services have been rendered.

•

Trade Shows Revenue — income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred.

•

Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.

•

Temperature Controlled Logistics Revenue – income arising from our investment in AmeriCold. Storage and handling revenue are recognized as services are provided. Transportation fees are recognized upon delivery to customers.

•

Management, Leasing and Other Fees – income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.

Derivative Instruments And Hedging Activities:

SFAS No. 133:

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(“SFAS No. 133”), as amended and interpreted, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. As required by SFAS No. 133, we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings. We assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction. For derivatives not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.

Income Taxes:

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2007 were characterized for Federal income tax purposes as 61.6% ordinary income and 38.4% long-term capital gain income. Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2006 were characterized for Federal income tax purposes as 29% ordinary income,
14.8% long-term capital gain income and 56.2% return of capital. Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2005 were characterized for Federal income tax purposes as 93.6% ordinary income and 6.4% long-term capital gain income.

We have elected to treat certain of our consolidated subsidiaries, and may in the future elect to treat newly formed subsidiaries, as taxable REIT subsidiaries pursuant to an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code that became effective January 1, 2001.  Taxable REIT subsidiaries may participate in non-real estate related activities and/or perform non-customary services for tenants and are subject to Federal and State income tax at regular corporate tax rates.  Other than the taxable REIT subsidiaries of AmeriCold, our taxable REIT subsidiaries had a combined current income tax liability of approximately $11,545,000 and $2,683,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and have immaterial differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities.   AmeriCold’s taxable REIT subsidiaries are accounted for using the asset and liability
method, under which deferred income taxes are recognized for (i) temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and (ii) operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. Deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence, including tax planning strategies.  As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, AmeriCold has recorded deferred income tax assets of $8,254,000 and $14,274,000, respectively, and deferred income tax liabilities of $3,745,000 and $7,603,000, respectively.  The net amount of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included in “Other Assets” on our consolidated balance sheets.

In connection with purchase accounting for H Street, in July 2005 and April 2007 we recorded an aggregate of $220,000,000 of deferred tax liabilities for the differences between the tax basis and the book basis of the acquired assets and liabilities.  We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of February 2008, we have completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008.  Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, the deferred tax liabilities will be eliminated and we will recognize $220,000,000 as an income tax benefit on our consolidated statement of income.

Income Per Share:

Basic income per share is computed based on weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted income per share considers the effect of all potentially dilutive share equivalents, including outstanding employee stock options, restricted shares, warrants and convertible or redeemable securities.

Stock-Based Compensation:

Our stock based compensation consists of awards to certain of our employees and officers and consist of stock options, restricted common shares, restricted Operating Partnership units and out-performance plan awards.  The terms of each of these awards are described in Note 11. Stock-Based Compensation.  We account for all stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123:

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, as amended by SFAS No. 148:

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure

and as revised by SFAS No. 123R:

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123R”).  We adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective application, on January 1, 2006.

Stock option awards

We determine the value of stock option awards granted in 2003 and thereafter, using a binomial valuation model and appropriate market assumptions adjusted to include an estimated forfeiture factor which is based on our past history.  Compensation expense for stock option awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally five years.

In 2002 and prior years, we accounted for stock option awards using the intrinsic value method. Under the intrinsic value method compensation cost was measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of Vornado’s common shares on the date of grant over the exercise price of the option granted.  Because our policy is to grant options with an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low market price of Vornado’s common shares on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) on the grant date, no compensation cost was recognized for stock options granted prior to 2003.  See Note 11. Stock-Based Compensation, for pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, assuming compensation cost for grants prior to 2003 was recognized as compensation expense based on the fair value at the grant dates.

Restricted stock and Operating Partnership awards

Restricted stock awards are valued using the average of the high and low market price of Vornado’s common shares on the NYSE on the date of grant, adjusted to include an estimated forfeiture factor which is based on our past history.   Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally three to five years.  Dividends paid on unvested shares are charged to retained earnings.  Dividends on shares that are canceled or terminated prior to vesting are charged to compensation expense in the period they are cancelled or terminated.

Restricted Operating Partnership unit awards are also valued using the average of the high and low market price of Vornado’s common shares on the NYSE on the date of grant, adjusted to include an estimated forfeiture factor which is based on our past history.  Compensation expense is recognized over the five year vesting period using a graded vesting attribution model as these awards are subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition.  Dividends paid on unvested units are charged to minority interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations.  Dividends on units that are canceled or terminated prior to the satisfaction of the performance condition and vesting are charged to compensation expense in the period they are cancelled or terminated.

Out-performance plan awards

Out-performance plan awards are valued using a risk-free valuation model and appropriate market assumptions as of the date of grant, adjusted to include an estimated forfeiture factor which is based on our past history.   Compensation expense is recognized over five years using a graded vesting attribution model as these awards are subject to the satisfaction of certain market and performance conditions, in addition to vesting.

Recently Issued Accounting Literature

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”).

SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008.  The FASB has deferred the implementation of the provisions of SFAS 157 relating to certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities until January 1, 2009. This standard is not expected to materially affect how we determine fair value, but may result in certain additional disclosures.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158,

Employer’s Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of SFAS No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R

(“SFAS 158”).  SFAS 158 requires an employer to (i) recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan’s over-funded status or a liability for a plan’s under-funded status; (ii) measure a plan’s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (iii) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur.  Those changes will be reported in comprehensive income.  The adoption of the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure
requirements as of December 31, 2006 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.  The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations to determine the funded status as of the end of the fiscal year and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur is effective on January 1, 2009. The adoption of the measurement date provisions of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.  SFAS 159 is effective for us on January 1, 2008.  We have not elected the fair value option for any of our existing financial instruments on the effective date and have not determined whether or not we will elect this option for any eligible financial instruments we acquire in the future.

On August 31, 2007, the FASB issued a proposed FASB Staff Position (the “proposed FSP”) that affects the accounting for our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures and Series D-13 convertible preferred units.  The proposed FSP requires the initial proceeds from the sale of our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures and Series D-13 convertible preferred units to be allocated between a liability component and an equity component.  The resulting discount must be amortized using the effective interest method over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding as additional interest expense.  If adopted, we expect that the proposed FSP would be effective for our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2009 and would require retroactive application.  The adoption of the proposed FSP on January 1, 2009 would result in the recognition of an aggregate unamortized debt
discount of $180,429,000 (as of December 31, 2007) on our consolidated balance sheet and additional interest expense on our consolidated statements of income.  Our current estimate of the incremental interest expense, net of minority interest, for each reporting period is as follows:

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141R,

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141R”).  SFAS 141R broadens the guidance of SFAS 141, extending its applicability to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. It broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and interests transferred as a result of business combinations; and stipulates that acquisition related costs be expensed rather than included as part of the basis of the acquisition.  SFAS 141R expands required disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for all transactions entered into on or after January 1, 2009.  The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 could materially impact
our future financial results to the extent that we acquire significant amounts of real estate, as related acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred compared to our current practice of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life of the assets acquired.

In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - An Amendment of ARB No. 51 (“SFAS 160”).  SFAS 160 requires a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be identified in the consolidated financial statements.  SFAS 160 also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parent’s ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation. SFAS 160 is effective on January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact SFAS 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Acquisitions and Dispositions

Acquisitions:

We completed approximately $4,045,400,000 of real estate acquisitions and investments in 2007 and $1,650,559,000 in 2006.  We record the assets (primarily land, building, in-place and above market leases) and liabilities (primarily mortgage debt and below market leases) acquired in real estate acquisitions at their estimated fair values.  Below are the details of our larger acquisitions.

New York Office:

350 Park Avenue, New York City

On December 14, 2006, we acquired 350 Park Avenue for $542,000,000 in cash.  The building occupies the entire westerly block front on Park Avenue between 51

st

and 52

nd

Streets and contains 538,000 square feet of office space.  At closing, we completed a $430,000,000, five-year, interest-only financing secured by the property, which bears interest at 5.48%.  We consolidate the accounts of this property into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

100 West 33

rd

Street, New York City (the “Manhattan Mall”)

On January 10, 2007, we acquired the Manhattan Mall for approximately $689,000,000 in cash.  This mixed-use property is located on the entire Sixth Avenue block-front between 32

nd

and 33

rd

Streets in Manhattan and contains approximately 1,000,000 square feet, including 845,000 square feet of office space and 164,000 square feet of retail space. Included as part of the acquisition were 250,000 square feet of additional air rights.  The property is adjacent to our Hotel Pennsylvania.  At closing, we completed a $232,000,000 financing secured by the property, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.55% (5.20% at December 31, 2007) and matures in two years with three one-year extension options.  The operations of the office component of the property are included in the New York Office segment and the operations of the retail component are included in the Retail segment.
We consolidate the accounts of this property into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street

On
    May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290
    Avenue of the Americas, a 2,000,000 square foot Manhattan
    office building located on the block-front between 51

st

and

nd

Street on Avenue of the Americas, and the
    three-building 555 California Street complex (“555 California
    Street”) containing 1,800,000 square feet, known as
    the Bank of America Center, located at California and Montgomery
    Streets in San Francisco’s financial district.  The
    purchase price for our 70% interest in the real estate was
    approximately $1.8 billion, consisting of $1.0 billion of
    cash and $797,000,000 of existing debt. Our share of the
    debt is comprised of $308,000,000 secured by 1290 Avenue
    of the Americas and $489,000,000 secured by 555 California
    Street. Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase
    of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies  that
    own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership
    interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships
    that own the two properties. The remaining 30% limited partnership
    interest is owned by Donald J. Trump. The operations of 1290
    Avenue of the Americas are included in the New York Office
    segment and the operations of 555 California Street are included
    in the Other segment. We consolidate the accounts of these
    properties into our consolidated financial statements from
    the date of acquisition.

In August 2005, Mr. Trump brought a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court against, among others, the general partners of the partnerships referred to above.   Mr. Trump’s claims arose out of a dispute over the sale price of, and use of proceeds from, the sale of properties located on the former Penn Central rail yards between West 59th and 72nd Streets in Manhattan which were formerly owned by the partnerships.  In decisions dated September 14, 2005 and July 24, 2006, the Court denied various of Mr. Trump’s motions and ultimately dismissed all of Mr. Trump’s claims, except for his claim seeking access to books and records.   In a decision dated October 1, 2007, the Court determined that Mr. Trump had already received access to the books and records to which he was entitled, with the exception of certain documents which were
subsequently delivered to Mr. Trump.  Mr. Trump has sought re-argument and renewal on, and filed a notice of appeal in connection with, his dismissed claims.

In connection with the acquisition, we agreed to indemnify the sellers for liabilities and expenses arising out of Mr. Trump’s claim that the general partners of the partnerships we acquired did not sell the rail yards at a fair price or could have sold the rail yards for a greater price and any other claims asserted in the legal action; provided however, that if Mr. Trump prevails on certain claims involving partnership matters, other than claims relating to sale price, the sellers will be required to reimburse us for certain costs related to those claims.  We believe that the claims relating to the sale price are without merit.  All other allegations are not asserted as a basis for damages and regardless of merit would not be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Washington, DC Office:

H Street Building Corporation (“H Street”)

In
    July 2005, we acquired H Street, which owns a 50% interest
    in real estate assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia
    and Washington, DC. On April 30, 2007, we acquired the corporations
    that own the remaining 50% interest in these assets for approximately
    $383,000,000, consisting of $322,000,000 in cash and $61,000,000
    of existing mortgages. These assets include twin office buildings
    located in Washington, DC, containing 577,000 square feet,
    and assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia, comprised
    of 34 acres of land leased to three residential and retail
    operators, a 1,680 unit high-rise apartment complex and 10
    acres of vacant land. In conjunction with this acquisition
    all existing litigation was dismissed. Beginning on April
    30, 2007, we consolidate the accounts of these entities into
    our consolidated financial statements and no longer account
for them on the equity method.

Further, we agreed to sell approximately 19.6 of the 34 acres of land to one of the existing ground lessees in two closings over a two-year period for approximately $220,000,000.  On May 11, 2007, we closed on the sale of 11 of the 19.6 acres for $104,000,000 and received $5,000,000 in cash and a $99,000,000 note due December 31, 2007.  On September 28, 2007, the buyer pre-paid the note in cash and we recognized a net gain on sale of $4,803,000.  In April 2007, we received letters from the two remaining ground lessees claiming a right of first offer on the sale of the land, one of which has since retracted its letter and reserved its rights under the lease.

In connection with purchase accounting, in July 2005 and April 2007 we recorded an aggregate of $220,000,000 of deferred tax liabilities for the differences between the tax basis and the book basis of the acquired assets and liabilities.  We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of February 2008, we have completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008.  Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, the deferred tax liabilities will be eliminated and we will recognize $220,000,000 as an income tax benefit on our consolidated statement of income.

Our
    total purchase price for 100% of the assets we will own,
    after the anticipated proceeds from the land sales, is $409,000,000,
    consisting of $286,000,000 in cash and $123,000,000 of existing
mortgages.

1999 K Street, Washington, DC

On April 13, 2006, we acquired the 92.65% interest that we did not already own of 1999 K Street for $52,800,000, consisting of $34,600,000 in cash and $18,200,000 of existing mortgage debt.  This property is located in the Central Business District of Washington, DC.  We consolidate the accounts of this property into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.  Mitchell N. Schear, President of our Washington, DC Office division, received $3,675,000 for his share of the proceeds as a partner of the selling entity.

BNA Complex

On August 9, 2007, we acquired a three building complex from The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. (“BNA”) for $111,000,000 in cash.  The complex contains approximately 300,000 square feet and is located in Washington’s West End between Georgetown and the Central Business District.  We plan to convert two of these buildings to rental apartments.  We consolidate the accounts of these properties into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

San Francisco Bay Area Properties

On January 10, 2006, we acquired four properties for approximately $72,000,000 in cash. The properties are located in the San Francisco Bay area and contain a total of 189,000 square feet of retail and office space. We consolidate the accounts of these properties into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

Springfield Mall, Virginia

On January 31, 2006, we acquired an option to purchase the Springfield Mall for $35,600,000, of which we paid $14,000,000 in cash upon closing and $13,200,000 in installments through December 31, 2007.  The remainder of $8,400,000 will be paid in installments over the next two years.  The mall, located on 79 acres at the intersection of Interstate 95 and Franconia Road in Springfield, Virginia, contains 1.4 million square feet and is anchored by Macy’s, and J.C. Penney and Target who own their stores aggregating 389,000 square feet.  We intend to redevelop, reposition and re-tenant the mall. The option becomes exercisable upon the passing of one of the existing principals of the selling entity and may be deferred at our election through November 2012. Upon exercise of the option, we will pay $80,000,000 to acquire the mall, subject to the existing mortgage of $180,000,000, which will be
amortized to $149,000,000 at maturity in 2013. Upon closing of the option on January 31, 2006, we acquired effective control of the mall, including management of the mall and right to the mall’s net cash flow. Accordingly, we consolidate the accounts of the mall into our consolidated financial statements pursuant to the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46R,

    this joint venture on the equity method.

Derivative Instruments and Related Marketable Securities

Investment in McDonald’s Corporation (“McDonalds”) (NYSE: MCD)

In July 2005 we acquired 858,000 McDonalds’ common shares at a weighted average price of $29.54 per share.  These shares were classified as “available-for-sale” marketable equity securities on our consolidated balance sheet and the fluctuations in the market value of these shares during the period of our ownership was recorded as “other comprehensive income” in the shareholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheet.  During October 2007, we sold all of these shares at a weighted average price of $56.45 per share and recognized a net gain of $23,090,000, representing accumulated appreciation during the period of our ownership.

During the second half of 2005, we acquired an economic interest in an additional 14,565,500 McDonalds’ common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which we purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on McDonalds’ common shares. These call and put options had an initial weighted-average strike price of $32.66 per share, or an aggregate of $475,692,000 and provided for net cash settlement. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increased at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and was decreased for dividends received. The options provided us with the same economic gain or loss as if we had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate purchase price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options
were derivatives and did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period were recognized as “investment income or loss” on our consolidated statements of income.  In 2006, we sold 2,119,500 of these shares at a weighted average price of $35.49 per share, and acquired an additional 1,250,000 option shares at a weighted average price of $33.08 per share. As of December 31, 2006, there were 13,695,500 option shares in the derivative position with an adjusted weighted average strike price of $32.70 per share.  During August, September and October 2007, we settled the 13,695,500 option shares and received an aggregate of $260,719,000 in cash.  During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized net gains of $108,821,000, $138,815,000 and $17,254,000, respectively, representing income from the mark-to-market of these shares during the period of our ownership
through their settlement, net of related LIBOR charges.

The aggregate net gain from inception of our investments in McDonalds in 2005 through final settlement in October 2007 was $289,414,000.

Investment in Sears, Roebuck and Co. (“Sears”)

In August and September 2004, we acquired an economic interest in 7,916,900 Sears’ common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which we purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on Sears’ common shares. These call and put options had an initial weighted-average strike price of $39.82 per share, or an aggregate of $315,250,000. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increased at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and was decreased for dividends received. The options provided us with the same economic gain or loss as if we had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options were derivatives and did not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period were recognized as “investment income or loss” on our consolidated statements of income.

On March 30, 2005, as a result of the merger between Sears and Kmart and pursuant to the terms of the contract, our derivative position representing 7,916,900 Sears common shares became a derivative position representing 2,491,819 common shares of Sears Holdings, Inc. (“Sears Holdings”) (Nasdaq: SHLD) valued at $323,936,000 based on the then closing share price of $130.00 and $146,663,000 of cash. As a result, we recognized a net gain of $58,443,000 based on the fair value of the derivative position on March 30, 2005. In 2005 we sold 402,660 of the option shares at a weighted average price of $124.44 per share. In 2006, we settled the remaining 2,089,159 option shares at a weighted average price of $125.43 per share.  During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we recognized net gains of $18,611,000 and $41,482,000, respectively, representing income from the mark-to-market
of these shares during the period of our ownership through their settlement, net of related LIBOR charges.

Our aggregate net gain realized from inception of this investment in 2004 through settlement was $142,877,000.

Investment in Sears Canada, Inc. (“Sears Canada”)

On April 3, 2006, we tendered the 7,500,000 Sears Canada shares we owned to Sears Holdings at the increased tender price of Cdn. $18.00 per share (the equivalent at that time of US $15.68 per share), which resulted in a net gain of $55,438,000, the difference between the tender price, and our carrying amount of $8.29 per share.  Together with income recognized in the fourth quarter of 2005 that resulted from a Sears Canada special dividend, the aggregate net gain from inception in 2005 on our $143,737,000 investment was $78,323,000.  If at any time on or before December 31, 2008 Sears Canada or any of its affiliates pays more than Cdn. $18.00 per share to acquire Sears Canada common shares from third parties, we will be entitled to receive the difference as additional consideration for the shares we sold.

GMH Communities L.P. Stock Purchase Warrants

In July 2004, we purchased for $1,000,000, warrants to acquire GMH Communities L.P. (“GMH”) common equity.  The warrants entitled us to acquire (i) 6,666,667 GMH limited partnership units at an exercise price of $7.50 per unit and (ii) 5,496,724 GMH limited partnership units at an exercise price of $8.22 per unit.  The warrants were accounted for as derivative instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  Accordingly, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the warrants at the end of each reporting period were recognized as “investment income or loss” on our consolidated statements of income.

On November 3, 2004, we exercised our first tranche of warrants to acquire 6,666,667 limited partnership units at a price of $7.50 per unit, or an aggregate of $50,000,000.   On May 2, 2006, the date our remaining GMH warrants were to expire, we received 1,817,247 GMH Communities Trust (NYSE: GCT) (“GCT”) common shares through an automatic cashless exercise. The amount of the shares received was equal to the excess of GCT’s average closing share price for the trailing 20-day period ending on May 1, 2006 and the $8.22 exercise price, divided by GCT’s average closing share price for the trailing 20-day period ending on May 1, 2006, then multiplied by 6,085,180 warrants.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a net loss of $16,370,000, resulting from the difference between the value of the GCT common shares received on May 2, 2006 and GCT’s closing share price of $15.51 on December 31, 2005.  For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized income of $14,079,000 from the mark-to-market of the warrants which were valued using a trinomial option pricing model based on GCT’s closing stock price on the NYSE of $15.51 and $14.10 per share on December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

From inception of our investment in the warrants, including the first tranche of warrants exercised on November 3, 2004, we recognized an aggregate net gain of $51,399,000.

Investments in Partially Owned Entities

Toys “R” Us (“Toys”)

As of December 31, 2007, we own 32.7% of Toys.  The business of Toys is highly seasonal.  Historically, Toys’ fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income.  Because Toys’ fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, we record our 32.7% share of Toys’ net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis.

In 2006, Toys closed 87 Toys “R” Us stores in the United States as a result of its store-closing program.  Toys incurred restructuring and other charges aggregating approximately $127,000,000 before tax, which includes $44,000,000 for the cost of liquidating the inventory. Our share of the $127,000,000 charge was $42,000,000, of which $27,300,000 had no income statement effect as a result of purchase accounting and the remaining portion relating to the cost of liquidating inventory of approximately $9,100,000 after-tax, was recognized as an expense as part of our equity in Toys’ net income in 2006.

GMH Communities L.P. (“GMH”)

GMH is a self-advised, self-managed, specialty housing company that focuses on providing housing to college and university students residing off-campus and to members of the U.S. military and their families located on or near military bases throughout the United States.

At December 31, 2007, we own 7,337,857 GMH Communities L.P. (“GMH”) limited partnership units, which are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common shares of GMH Communities Trust (NYSE: GCT) (“GCT”), and 2,517,247 common shares of GCT, or 13.8% of the limited partnership interest of GMH.   Our ownership interest was acquired primarily as a result of the exercise of stock purchase warrants during 2004 and 2006.  See Note 5. Derivative Instruments and Related Marketable Securities for details of the warrants.  We account for our investment in GMH on the equity method and record our pro rata share of GMH’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis as we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that GCT files its financial statements.

On February 12, 2008, GCT announced that it has entered into two definitive agreements in connection with the sale of its military and student housing divisions for an aggregate sales price of approximately $9.61 per share/unit.   In addition, GCT anticipates selling its remaining assets prior to the closing of the merger.  The merger, which has been unanimously approved by GCT’s Board of Trustees, is subject to GCT shareholder approval and customary closing conditions.

As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of our investment in GMH and GCT based on GCT’s December 31, 2007 closing share price of $5.52, was $54,400,000, or $48,860,000 below the carrying amount of $10.48 per share/unit on our consolidated balance sheet.  We have concluded that as of December 31, 2007, the decline in the value of our investment is not “other-than-temporary,” based on the aggregate value anticipated to be received as a result of the transactions described above, including the additional consideration from the sale of GCT’s remaining assets.

The Lexington Master Limited Partnership, formerly The Newkirk Master Limited Partnership

On December 31, 2006, Newkirk Realty Trust (NYSE: NKT) was acquired in a merger by Lexington Corporate Properties Trust (“Lexington”) (NYSE: LXP), a real estate investment trust that invests in, owns and manages commercial properties net leased to major corporations throughout the United States.

The units in Newkirk MLP, which we accounted for on the equity method, were converted on a 0.80 for 1 basis into limited partnership units of Lexington MLP, which we also account for on the equity method.  In addition, effective as of the effective time of the merger, Newkirk terminated its advisory agreement with NKT Advisors, in which we had a 20.0% interest, for an aggregate payment of $12,500,000, of
which our share was $2,300,000.  On December 31, 2006, we recognized a net gain of $10,362,000, as a result of the merger transactions.

At December 31, 2007, we own 8,149,593 limited partnership units of Lexington MLP, which are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common shares of Lexington, or a 7.5% limited partnership interest.  We record our pro rata share of Lexington MLP’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that Lexington files its financial statements.

At December 31, 2007, the fair value of our investment in Lexington MLP based on Lexington’s December 31, 2007 closing share price of $14.54, was $118,495,000, or $39,836,000 below the carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet.  We have concluded that as of December 31, 2007, the decline in the value of our investment is not “other-than-temporary.”

Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2006, two 50% owned entities that were contesting our acquisition of H Street impeded our access to their financial information and accordingly, we were unable to record our pro rata share of their earnings. 2006 includes $3,890 for our 50% share of their earnings for the period from July 20, 2005 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2005.

(3)

The year ended December 31, 2006 includes (i) a $10,362 net gain recognized as a result of the acquisition of Newkirk by Lexington and (ii) $10,842 for our share of Newkirk MLP’s net gains on sale of real estate.

(1)

On June 16, 2006, we acquired an 81.5% interest in a $95,968 mezzanine loan to Tharaldson Lodging Companies for $78,166 in cash. The loan is secured by a 107 hotel property portfolio with brands including Fairfield Inn, Residence Inn, Comfort Inn and Courtyard by Marriott. The loan is subordinate to $671,778 of debt and is senior to approximately $192,000 of other debt and equity. The loan matures in April 2008, with three one-year extensions, provides for a 0.75% placement fee and bears interest at LIBOR plus 4.30% (8.9% at December 31, 2007).

(2)

In 2005, we made a $135,000 loan to Riley HoldCo Corp., consisting of a $60,000 mezzanine loan and a $75,000 fixed rate unsecured loan. During 2006, we were repaid the $60,000 balance of the mezzanine loan with a pre-payment premium of $972, which was recognized as “interest and other investment income” for the year ended December 31, 2006.

(3)

On June 30, 2006, we made a $73,750 mezzanine loan secured by the equity interests in 280 Park Avenue, a 1.2 million square foot office building, located between 48

th

and 49

th

Streets in Manhattan. The loan bears interest at 10.25% and matures in June 2016. The loan is subordinate to $1.036 billion of other debt and is senior to approximately $260,000 of equity and interest reserves.

(4)

On February 10, 2006, we acquired a 50% interest in a $115,000 note issued by Related Equinox Holdings II, LLC (the “Note”), for $57,500 in cash. The Note is secured by a pledge of the stock of Related Equinox Holdings II. Related Equinox Holdings II owns Equinox Holdings Inc., which in turn owns all of the assets and obligations, including the fitness clubs, operated under the Equinox brand. The Note is junior to a $50,000 (undrawn) revolving loan and $280,000 of senior unsecured obligations. The Note is senior to $125,000 of cash equity contributed by third parties for their acquisition of the Equinox fitness club business. The Note matures on February 15, 2013 and bears interest at 14% through February 15, 2011, increasing by 3% per annum through maturity. The Note is prepayable at any time after February 15, 2009.

(5)

On
                June 5, 2007, we acquired a 42% interest in two
                MPH mezzanine loans totaling $158,700, for $66,000
                in cash. The loans, which were due on February
                8, 2008 and have not been repaid, are subordinate
                to $2.9 billion of mortgage and other debt and
                secured by the equity interests in four New York
                City properties: Worldwide Plaza, 1540 Broadway
                office condominium, 527 Madison Avenue and Tower
                56. We have reduced the net carrying amount of
                the loans to $9,000, by recognizing a $57,000
                non-cash charge which is included as a reduction
                of “interest
                and other investment income” on
                our consolidated statement of income for the
                year ended December 31,  2007.

(6)

On August 2, 2006, we purchased bonds for $99,500 in cash, representing a 7% interest in two margin loans aggregating $1.430 billion.  The loans were made to two separate funds managed by Fortress Investment Group LLC and were secured by $4.4 billion of publicly traded equity securities.  The loans, which were scheduled to mature in June 2007, were automatically extended to December 2007 and bore interest at LIBOR plus 3.50%.  On March 30, 2007, July 10, 2007 and October 2, 2007, we were repaid $35,348, $13,221 and $13,290, respectively.  The remaining balance of $37,641 was repaid to us on December 31, 2007.

On June 9, 2006, AmeriCold completed a $400,000 one-year, interest-only financing, collateralized by 21 of its owned and six of its leased temperature-controlled warehouses. On September 8, 2006 an amendment was executed increasing the amount of the loan to $430,000.  Of this loan, $243,000 was drawn on June 9, 2006 to repay the existing mortgage on the same facilities and the remaining $187,000 was drawn on September 27, 2006. The initial interest rate on the loan was LIBOR plus 0.60% and increased to LIBOR plus 1.25% when the remaining balance was drawn, subject to a 6.50% LIBOR cap.  On December 12, 2006, AmeriCold completed a 5.45% fixed-rate, interest-only financing in an aggregate principal amount of $1.05 billion which matures in approximately equal tranches in seven, nine and ten years.  The proceeds were used to repay $449,000 of fixed-rate mortgages
with a rate of 6.89% and the $430,000 financing described above.  The mortgages that were repaid were collateralized by 84 temperature-controlled warehouses which were released upon repayment.  The new loan is collateralized by 50 of these warehouses.  AmeriCold received net proceeds of $191,000, including the release of escrow reserves and after defeasance and closing costs.  Vornado, Crescent and Yucaipa received distributions of $88,023, $58,682 and $38,295, respectively, from a portion of the net proceeds.  Included in “interest and debt expense” for the year ended December 31, 2006 are $14,496 of defeasance costs and a $7,431 write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the old loans, of which our share, after minority interest is $10,433.

(14)

On July 3, 2007, we repaid $21,030 of the $46,837 outstanding balance of the mortgage loan which was secured by the Garfield, Edison and East Brunswick industrial warehouses.  We incurred $1,701 for prepayment penalties and defeasance costs which is included in “interest and debt expense” in the year ended December 31, 2007.

(15)

On July 29, 2006, we exercised the second of three one-year extension options of our Commerce Executive III, IV, and V mortgage loan.

(16)

On March 1, 2007, we repaid the $19,394 balance of the 1999 K Street mortgage loan.

(17)

On November 7, 2006, we completed a $130,000 refinancing of our 220 Central Park South property.  The loan has two tranches, the first tranche of $95,000 bears interest at LIBOR (capped at 5.50%) plus 2.35% (7.07% as of December 31, 2007) and the second tranche can be drawn up to $35,000 and bears interest at LIBOR (capped at 5.50%) plus 2.45% (7.17% as of December 31, 2007).  As of December 31, 2007 approximately $33,998 has been drawn on the second tranche.

(18)

On March 21, 2007, Vornado Realty Trust sold $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.85% convertible senior debentures due 2027, pursuant to an effective registration statement.  The aggregate net proceeds from this offering, after underwriters’ discounts and expenses, were approximately $1.37 billion.  The debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in 2012 for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures in 2012, 2017, and 2022 and in certain other limited circumstances.  The debentures are convertible, under certain circumstances, for cash and Vornado common shares at an initial conversion rate of 6.1553 common shares per one-thousand dollars of principal amount of debentures.  The initial conversion price of $162.46 represented a premium of 30%
over the March 21, 2007 closing price for our common shares. The principal amount of debentures will be settled for cash and the amount in excess of the principal defined as the conversion value will be settled in cash or, at our election, Vornado common shares.  The net proceeds of the offering were contributed to the Operating Partnership in the form of an inter-company loan and the Operating Partnership fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of the debentures.  There are no restrictions which limit the Operating Partnership from making distributions to Vornado and Vornado has no independent assets or operations outside of the Operating Partnership.

We are amortizing the underwriters’ discount on a straight-line basis (which approximates the effective interest method) over the period from the date of issuance to the date of earliest redemption of April 1, 2012.  Because the conversion option associated with the debentures, when analyzed as a freestanding instrument, meets the criteria to be classified as equity specified by paragraphs 12 to 32 of EITF 00-19

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s own Common Stock,”

On November 20, 2006, we sold $1,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.625% convertible senior debentures due 2026, pursuant to an effective registration statement.  The aggregate net proceeds from this offering, after underwriters’ discounts and expenses, were approximately $980,000.  The debentures are convertible, under certain circumstances, for Vornado common shares at a current conversion rate of 6.5168 common shares per $1 of principal amount of debentures. The initial conversion price of $153.45 represented a premium of 30% over the November 14, 2006 closing price for our common shares.  The debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in 2011 for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures in 2011, 2016, and 2021 and in the event of a change in
control.  The net proceeds of the offering were contributed to the Operating Partnership in the form of an inter-company loan and the Operating Partnership fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of the debentures.  There are no restrictions which limit the Operating Partnership from making distributions to Vornado and Vornado has no independent assets or operations outside of the Operating Partnership.

We are amortizing the underwriters’ discount on a straight-line basis (which approximates the effective interest method) over the period from the date of issuance to the date of earliest redemption of December 1, 2011.

On September 28, 2007, the Operating Partnership entered into a new $1.510 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which was increased by $85,000 on October 12, 2007 and can be increased to up to $2.0 billion during the initial term.  The new facility has a three-year term with two one-year extension options, bears interest at LIBOR plus 55 basis points (5.43% at December 31, 2007), based on our current credit ratings and requires the payment of an annual facility fee of 15 basis points.  Together with the existing $1.0 billion credit facility, we have an aggregate of $2.595 billion of unsecured revolving credit.  Vornado is the guarantor of the Operating Partnership’s obligations under both revolving credit agreements.

(24)

On June 28, 2006, the Operating Partnership entered into a $1,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced its previous $600,000 unsecured revolving credit facility that was due to mature in July 2006. This facility has a four-year term, with a one-year extension option and generally bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.55% (5.70% as of December 31, 2007) and requires the payment of an annual facility fee of 15 basis points.

Debt - continued

Our revolving credit facility and senior unsecured notes contain financial covenants which require us to maintain minimum interest coverage ratios and limit our debt to market capitalization ratios. We believe that we have complied with all of our financial covenants as of December 31, 2007.

On May 9, 2006, we executed supplemental indentures with respect to our senior unsecured notes due 2007, 2009 and 2010 (collectively, the “Notes”), pursuant to our consent solicitation statement dated April 18, 2006, as amended. Holders of approximately 96.7% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes consented to the solicitation. The supplemental indentures contain modifications of certain covenants and related defined terms governing the terms of the Notes to make them consistent with corresponding provisions of the covenants and defined terms included in the senior unsecured notes due 2011 issued on February 16, 2006. The supplemental indentures also include a new covenant that provides for an increase in the interest rate of the Notes upon certain decreases in the ratings assigned by rating agencies to the Notes. In connection with the consent solicitation we paid an
aggregate fee of $2,241,000 to the consenting note holders, which will be amortized into expense over the remaining term of the Notes. In addition, we incurred advisory and professional fees aggregating $1,415,000, which were expensed in 2006.

The net carrying amount of properties collateralizing the notes and mortgages payable amounted to $10.920 billion at December 31, 2007. As at December 31, 2007, the principal repayments required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows:

Stock-based Compensation

Our Share Option Plan (the “Plan”) provides for grants of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and performance shares to certain of our employees and officers.  We have approximately 5,465,093 shares available for future grant under the Plan at December 31, 2007.

In March 2006, our Board of Trustees (the “Board”) approved an amendment to our Plan to permit the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”) to grant awards in the form of limited partnership units (“OP Units”) of the Operating Partnership. OP Units can be granted either as free-standing awards or in tandem with other awards under the Plan. OP Units may be converted into the Operating Partnership’s Class A common units and, consequently, become convertible by the holder on a one-for-one basis for our common shares or the cash value of such shares at our election.

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123:

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,

as amended by SFAS No. 148:

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure

and as revised by SFAS No. 123R:

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123R”).  We adopted SFAS No. 123R, using the modified prospective application, on January 1, 2006.  Stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 consists of stock option awards, restricted common share and Operating Partnership unit awards and out-performance plan awards.  Stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 consist of stock option awards and restricted common share awards.

Out-Performance Plan

In March 2006, the Board approved the terms of the Vornado Realty Trust 2006 Out-Performance Plan (the “Out-Performance Plan”), a long-term “pay-for-performance” incentive compensation program. The purpose of the Out-Performance Plan was to further align the interests of our shareholders and management by encouraging our senior officers and employees to create shareholder value.  On April 25, 2006, our Compensation Committee approved Out-Performance Plan awards to a total of 54 employees and officers of the Company, which aggregated 91% of the total Out-Performance Plan.  The fair value of the awards on the date of grant, as adjusted for estimated forfeitures, was approximately $46,141,000 and is being amortized into expense over the five-year vesting period beginning on the date of grant, using a graded vesting attribution model.

Under the Out-Performance Plan, award recipients share in a performance pool when our total return to shareholders exceeds a cumulative 30% (for a period of 30 consecutive days), including both share appreciation and dividends paid, from a price per share of $89.17 (the average closing price per common share for the 30 trading days prior to March 15, 2006). The size of the pool is 10% of the amount in excess of the 30% benchmark, subject to a maximum cap of $100,000,000.  Each award was designated as a specified percentage of the $100,000,000 maximum cap.  Awards were issued in the form of a new class of Operating Partnership units (“OPP Units”) and are subject to achieving the performance threshold, time vesting and other conditions.  OPP Units are convertible by the holder into an equivalent number of the Operating Partnership’s Class A units, which are redeemable by the
holder for Vornado common shares on a one-for-one basis or the cash value of such shares, at our election.  All awards earned vest 33.3% on each of March 15, 2009, 2010 and 2011 subject to continued employment.  Once a performance pool has been established, each OPP Unit will receive a distribution equal to the distribution paid on a Class A unit, including an amount payable in OPP Units representing distributions paid on a Class A unit during the performance period. As of January 12, 2007, the maximum performance threshold under the Out-Performance Plan was achieved, concluding the performance period.

For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we recognized $12,734,000 and $8,293,000, respectively, of compensation expense for these awards.  The remaining unrecognized compensation expense of $27,969,000 will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.  Distributions paid on unvested OPP Units are charged to “minority interest expense” on our consolidated statements of income and amounted to $2,694,000 in 2007 and $0 in 2006.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to 100% of the average of the high and low market price of Vornado’s common shares on the NYSE on the date of grant, generally vest pro-rata over three to five years and expire 10 years from the date of grant.

For stock option awards granted prior to 2003, we used the intrinsic value method of accounting. Under this method, we did not recognize compensation expense as the option exercise price was equivalent to the market price of Vornado’s common shares on the date of each grant. Because stock option awards granted prior to 2003 vested over a three-year term, the resulting compensation cost based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant, on a pro forma basis, would have been expensed during 2003, 2004 and 2005. Accordingly, our net income applicable to common shares would remain the same on a pro forma basis for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, and would have been reduced by $337,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, or $0.01 per basic income per share and no change in diluted income per share.

We recognized compensation expense for the fair value of options granted on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, we recognized $4,549,000, $1,705,000 and $1,042,000, respectively, of compensation expense related to the options granted during 2007-2005.

Restricted Common Shares

Restricted share awards are granted at the average of the high and low market price of Vornado’s common shares on the NYSE on the date of grant and generally vest over five years.  We recognized $4,079,000, $3,820,000 and $3,559,000 of compensation expense in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, for the portion of these awards that vested during each year. As of December 31, 2007, there was $6,529,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested shares granted under the Plan.  This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.   Dividends paid on unvested shares are charged directly to retained earnings and amounted to $533,000, $841,900 and $1,038,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Retirement Plans

We have two defined benefit pension plans, a Vornado Realty Trust Retirement Plan (“Vornado Plan”) and a Merchandise Mart Properties Pension Plan (“Mart Plan”). In addition, AmeriCold, which we consolidate into our consolidated financial statements beginning in November 2004, has two defined benefit pension plans (the “AmeriCold Plans” and together with the Vornado Plan and the Mart Plan, the “Plans”). The benefits under the Vornado Plan and the Mart Plan were frozen in December 1997 and June 1999, respectively. In April 2005, AmeriCold amended its AmeriCold Retirement Income Plan to freeze benefits for non-union participants. Benefits under the Plans are or were primarily based on years of service and compensation during employment or on years of credited service and established monthly benefits. Funding policy for the Plans is based on contributions
at the minimum amounts required by law. The financial results of the Plans are consolidated in the information provided below.

On January 16, 2008, our Board of Trustees approved the termination of the Vornado Plan and the Mart Plan.  Our current estimate of the cost we will incur during 2008 to buy annuities from an insurance company or to make lump-sum payments to plan participants to terminate both plans is approximately $4,000,000.

We use a December 31 measurement date for the Plans.

Leases

As lessor:

We lease space to tenants under operating leases. Most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base rentals payable monthly in advance. Shopping center leases provide for the pass-through to tenants of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance. Office building leases generally require the tenants to reimburse us for operating costs and real estate taxes above their base year costs. Shopping center leases also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ sales. As of December 31, 2007, future base rental revenue under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding rents for leases with an original term of less than one year and rents resulting from the exercise of renewal options, is as follows:

    and 2005, respectively.

None of our tenants represented more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Former Bradlees Locations

Pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, dated May 1, 1992, we are due $5,000,000 per annum of additional rent from Stop & Shop which was allocated to certain of Bradlees former locations. On December 31, 2002, prior to the expiration of the leases to which the additional rent was allocated, we reallocated this rent to other former Bradlees leases also guaranteed by Stop & Shop. Stop & Shop is contesting our right to reallocate and claims that we are no longer entitled to the additional rent. At December 31, 2007, we are due an aggregate of $25,400,000. We believe the additional rent provision of the guaranty expires at the earliest in 2012 and we are vigorously contesting Stop & Shop’s position.

Insurance

We carry commercial liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) “acts of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (“TRIPRA”), which expires in December 2014, and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to our assets. Our New York Office, Washington, DC Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart divisions have $1.5 billion of per occurrence all risk property insurance, including terrorism coverage, in effect through September 15, 2008.  AmeriCold has $250,000,000 of per occurrence all risk property insurance coverage, including terrorism coverage, in effect through January 1, 2009.   Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $150,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, and a $150,000,000
annual aggregate limit.

In June 2007 we formed Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, to act as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage and as a direct insurer for coverage for “certified” acts of terrorism and for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by TRIPRA.  Coverage for “certified” acts
    of terrorism is fully reinsured by third party insurance
    companies and the Federal government with no exposure to
    PPIC. Prior to the formation of PPIC, we were uninsured for
    losses under NBCR coverage. Subsequently, we have $1.5 billion
    of NBCR coverage under TRIPRA, for which PPIC is responsible
    for 15% of each NBCR loss and the insurance company deductible
    of $1,000,000. We are ultimately responsible for any loss
borne by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties (which are generally non-recourse to us), senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance and/or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Litigation

On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (“USDC-NJ”) claiming we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty. Stop & Shop asserted that a prior order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York dated February 6, 2001, as modified on appeal to the District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 13, 2001, froze our right to re-allocate which effectively terminated our right to collect the additional rent from Stop & Shop. On March 3, 2003, after we moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Stop & Shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint. On March 26, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a new complaint in New York Supreme Court, asserting
substantially the same claims as in its USDC-NJ complaint. We removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In January 2005 that court remanded the action to the New York Supreme Court. On February 14, 2005, we served an answer in which we asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the motions for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Court’s decision and on December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Court’s decision.
On January 16, 2007 we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Court’s decision which was denied on March 13, 2007.  We are currently engaged in discovery and anticipate that a trial date will be set for some time in 2008.  We intend to vigorously pursue our claims against Stop & Shop.  In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

On May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas and the 555 California Street complex.  Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties.  The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump.  In August 2005, Mr. Trump brought a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court against, among others, the general partners of the partnerships referred to above.   Mr. Trump’s claims arose out of a dispute over the sale price of, and use of proceeds from, the sale of properties located on the former Penn Central rail yards between West 59th and 72nd Streets in Manhattan which were formerly
owned by the partnerships.  In decisions dated September 14, 2005 and July 24, 2006, the Court denied various of Mr. Trump’s motions and ultimately dismissed all of Mr. Trump’s claims, except for his claim seeking access to books and records.  In a decision dated October 1, 2007, the Court determined that Mr. Trump already received access to the books and records to which he was entitled, with the exception of certain documents which were subsequently delivered to Mr. Trump.  Mr. Trump has sought re-argument and renewal on, and filed a notice of appeal in connection with, his dismissed claims.  In connection with the acquisition, we agreed to indemnify the sellers for liabilities and expenses arising out of Mr. Trump’s claim that the general partners of the partnerships we acquired did not sell the rail yards at a fair price or could have sold the rail yards for a greater price and any other claims asserted in the legal action; provided
however, that if Mr. Trump prevails on certain claims involving partnership matters, other than claims relating to sale price, the sellers will be required to reimburse us for certain costs related to those claims.  We believe that the claims relating to the sale price are without merit.  All other allegations are not asserted as a basis for damages and regardless of merit would not be material to our consolidated financial statements.

There are various other legal actions against us in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Other Contractual Obligations

At December 31, 2007, our $1 billion revolving credit facility, which expires in June 2010, had $49,788,000 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. Our revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants, which require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization, and provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. At December 31, 2007, AmeriCold’s $30,000,000 revolving credit facility had $19,086,000 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. This facility requires AmeriCold to maintain, on a trailing four-quarter basis, a minimum of $30,000,000 of free cash flow, as defined. Our revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment,
including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

We entered into agreements for the purchase and resale of U.S. government obligations for periods of up to one week. The obligations purchased under these agreements are held in safekeeping in our name by various money center banks. We have the right to demand additional collateral or return of these invested funds at any time the collateral value is less than 102% of the invested funds plus any accrued earnings thereon. We had $82,240,000 and $219,990,000 of cash invested in these agreements at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

We have made acquisitions and investments in partially owned entities for which we are committed to fund additional capital aggregating $167,389,000 as of December 31, 2007. Of this amount, $115,000,000 relates to our equity commitment to the India Property Fund, L.P., and $21,800,000 relates to capital expenditures committed to the Springfield Mall, in which we have a 97.5% interest.

On November 10, 2005, we committed to fund the junior portion of up to $30,530,000 of a $173,000,000 construction loan to an entity developing a mix-use building complex in Boston, Massachusetts, at the north end of the Boston Harbor. We will earn current-pay interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 11%. The loan will mature in November 2008, with a one-year extension option. As of December 31, 2007, we have funded $18,912,000 of this commitment.

On January 16, 2008, our Board of Trustees approved the termination of the Vornado Realty Trust Employees Retirement Plan and the Merchandise Mart Properties Pension Plan.  These plans were frozen in 1998 and 1999, respectively.  Our current estimate of the cost we will incur during 2008 to buy annuities from an insurance company or to make lump-sum payments to plan participants to terminate both plans is approximately $4,000,000.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

From time to time, we have disposed of substantial amounts of real estate to third parties for which, as to certain properties, we remain contingently liable for rent payments or mortgage indebtedness that we cannot quantify.

Loan and Compensation Agreements

On November 30, 2006, Michael Fascitelli, our President, repaid to the Company his $8,600,000 outstanding loan which was scheduled to mature in December 2006.  The loan was made to him in 1996 pursuant to his employment agreement.

On December 31, 2006, 1,546,106 shares held in a rabbi trust, established for deferred compensation purposes as part of Mr. Fascitelli’s 1996 and 2001 employment agreements, were distributed to Mr. Fascitelli, net of 739,130 shares which were used to satisfy the resulting tax withholding obligation.  The shares we received for the tax liability were retired upon receipt.

On December 22, 2005, Steven Roth, our Chief Executive Officer, repaid to the Company his $13,122,500 outstanding loan which was scheduled to mature in January 2006.  Pursuant to a credit agreement dated November 1999, Mr. Roth may draw up to $15,000,000 of loans from the Company on a revolving basis.  Each loan bears interest, payable quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the loan is made and matures on the sixth anniversary of such loan.  Loans are collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the amount outstanding.  On December 23, 2005, Mr. Roth borrowed $13,122,500 under this facility, which bears interest at 4.45% per annum and matures on December 23, 2011.

Pursuant to our annual compensation review in February 2002 with Joseph Macnow, our Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee approved a $2,000,000 loan to Mr. Macnow, which bore interest at the applicable federal rate of 4.65% per annum and matures in June 2007. The loan was funded on July 23, 2002 and was collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the loan amount.  On March 26, 2007, Mr. Macnow repaid to us his $2,000,000 outstanding loan.

Effective as of April 19, 2007, we entered into a new employment agreement with Mitchell Schear, the President of our Washington, DC Office Division.  This agreement, which replaced his prior agreement, was approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Trustees and provides for a term of five years and is automatically renewable for one-year terms thereafter.  The agreement also provides for a minimum salary of $1,000,000 per year and bonuses and other customary benefits.  Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on April 19, 2007, the Compensation Committee granted options to Mr. Schear to acquire 200,000 of our common shares at an exercise price of $119.94 per share.  These options vest ratably over three years beginning in 2010 and accelerate on a change of control or if we terminate his employment without cause or by him for breach by us.  The agreement also provides that if we
terminate Mr. Schear’s employment without cause or by him for breach by us, he will receive a lump-sum payment equal to one year’s salary and bonus, up to a maximum of $2,000,000.

Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees of the Company

Alexander’s

We own 32.8% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President, are officers and directors of Alexander’s.  We provide various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements.  These agreements are described in Note 6. Investments in Partially Owned Entities.

On December 29, 2005, Michael Fascitelli, our President and President of Alexander’s, exercised 350,000 of his Alexander’s stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) which were scheduled to expire in December 2006 and received $173.82 for each SAR exercised, representing the difference between Alexander’s stock price of $247.70 (the average of the high and low market price) on the date of exercise and the exercise price of $73.88. This exercise was consistent with Alexander’s tax planning.

On January 10, 2006, the Omnibus Stock Plan Committee of the Board of Directors of Alexander’s granted Mr. Fascitelli a SAR covering 350,000 shares of Alexander’s common stock. The exercise price of the SAR is $243.83 per share of common stock, which was the average of the high and low trading price of Alexander’s common stock on date of grant. The SAR became exercisable on July 10, 2006, provided Mr. Fascitelli is employed with Alexander’s on such date, and was set to expire on March 14, 2007. Mr. Fascitelli’s early exercise and Alexander’s related tax consequences were factors in Alexander’s decision to make the new grant to him.  On March 13, 2007, Michael Fascitelli, our President of Alexander’s, exercised 350,000 of his SARS and received $144.18 for each SAR exercised representing the difference between Alexander’s stock price
of $388.01 (the average of the high and low market price) on the date of exercise and the exercise price of $243.83.

Interstate Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Steven Roth, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s, are Interstate’s two other partners. As of December 31, 2007, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned approximately 8.3% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 27.2% of Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days’ notice at the end of the term. We believe based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies that the management agreement terms are fair to us. We earned $800,000, $798,000 and $791,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Other

On December 20, 2005, we acquired a 46% partnership interest in, and became co-general partner of, partnerships that own a complex in Rosslyn, Virginia, containing four office buildings with an aggregate of 714,000 square feet and two apartment buildings containing 195 rental units. The consideration for the acquisition consisted of 734,486 newly issued Operating Partnership units (valued at $61,814,000 at acquisition) and $27,300,000 for our pro-rata share of existing debt. Of the partnership interest acquired, 19% was from Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod, trustees of Vornado, and their family members, representing all of their interest in the partnership.

On April 13, 2006, we acquired the 92.65% interest that we did not already own of 1999 K Street, located in the Central Business District of Washington, DC. The purchase price for the 92.65% interest was $52,800,000, consisting of $34,600,000 in cash and $18,200,000 of existing mortgage debt.  Mitchell N. Schear, President of our Washington, DC Office division, received $3,675,000 for his share of the proceeds as a partner of the selling entity.

Minority Interest

Minority
    interest on our consolidated balance sheets aggregated $1,493,760,000
    and $1,128,204,000 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    Of these balances, $958,003,000 and $972,915,000, respectively,
represent third-party limited partners’ interests in the Operating Partnership; and $535,757,000 and $155,289,000, respectively, represent the minority ownership of consolidated partially owned entities.

Class A units of the Operating Partnership are redeemable at the option of the holder for Vornado common shares on a one-for-one basis, or at our option for cash.   Because the number of Vornado common shares outstanding at all times equals the number of Class A units owned by Vornado, the redemption value of each Class A unit is equivalent to the market value of one Vornado common share, and the quarterly distribution to a Class A unitholder is equal to the quarterly dividend paid to a Vornado common shareholder.  Accordingly, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the aggregate redemption value of the then outstanding Class A units of the Operating Partnership owned by minority limited partners was approximately $1,366,000,000 and $1,874,000,000, respectively.

Notes to Preceding Tabular Information:

(1)

Effective on October 2, 2006, all of the then outstanding Series B-1 and Series B-2 preferred units were exchanged for 653,574 Class A units, 304,761 new Class B-2 units and 139,798 new Class B-1 units.  The new Class B-1 and B-2 units are convertible into Class A units at a rate of 100 Class A units for each pairing of 100 Class B-1 units and 218 Class B-2 units.  Class B-1 unitholders are entitled to receive, in liquidation, an amount equal to the positive difference, if any, between the amount paid in liquidation for a Class A unit and the amount paid in respect of a Class B-2 unit multiplied by 2.18.  Class B-2 unitholders are entitled to receive in liquidation the lesser of $50 per unit or the amount paid in respect of a Class A unit on liquidation divided by 2.18.  Class B-1 unitholders receive distributions only if, and to the extent that, we
pay quarterly dividends on the Class A units in excess of $0.85 per unit.  Class B-2 unitholders are expected to receive quarterly distributions of $0.39 per unit.

(2)

The holders of the Series F-1 preferred units have the right to require us to redeem the units for cash equal to the liquidation preference or, at our option, by issuing a variable number of Vornado common shares with a value equal to the liquidation amount. In accordance with SFAS No. 150, the liquidation amount of the F-1 preferred units are classified as a liability, and the related distributions as interest expense, because of the possible settlement of this obligation by issuing a variable number of Vornado common shares.

              preference. These units are redeemable after 4
              years at the option of the holder and after 10
              years at our option. Upon redemption, the holder
              may elect to receive either (i) cash or (ii) a
              debt-financed distribution of cash, or at our option
              (iii) Class A Operating Partnership units equal
              to the redemption value based on the redemption
              reference price, as defined. The G-2 and G-4 unitholders
              are entitled to receive quarterly distributions
              at a fixed rate $0.34375 per unit and the G-1 and
              G-3 unitholders are entitled to receive quarterly
              distributions at a variable rate of LIBOR plus
              0.90% (5.50% at December 31, 2007). The G-2 and
              G-3 units have variable redemption terms which,
              based on fluctuations in the value of our common
              shares, may cause a change in the value of the
              units redeemed. The G-1 and G-4 units have fixed
              redemption terms at the stated value of $25.00
              per unit liquidation preference. In accordance
              with SFAS No. 150, the liquidation amount of these
              units is classified as a liability, and the related
              distributions as interest expense, because these
              units are mandatorily redeemable by the holders.

Convertible
              at the option of the holder for an equivalent amount
              of Vornado preferred shares and redeemable at our
              option after the 5th anniversary of the date of
              issuance (ranging from November 2008 to December
              2011).

(5)

The
              Series D-13 units may be called without penalty
              at our option commencing in December 2011 or redeemed
              at the option of the holder commencing in December
              2006 for cash equal to the liquidation preference
              of $25.00 per unit, or at our option, by issuing
              a variable number of Vornado’s common shares.
              In accordance with SFAS No. 150, the liquidation
              amount of the D-13 units are classified as a liability,
              and related distributions as interest expense,
              because of the possible settlement of this obligation
              by issuing a variable number of Vornado common
              shares.

(6)

On May 2, 2006, we sold 1,400,000 perpetual 6.875% Series D-15 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units, at a price of $25.00 per unit. On August 17, 2006 we sold an additional 400,000 Series D-15 Units at a price of $25.00 per unit, for a combined total of 1,800,000 Series D-15 units and net proceeds of $43,875,000. We may redeem the Series D-15 Units at a price of $25.00 per unit after May 2, 2011.

Income Per Share

The following table provides a reconciliation of both net income and the number of common shares used in the computation of (i) basic income per common share - which utilizes the weighted average number of common shares outstanding without regard to dilutive potential common shares, and (ii) diluted income per common share - which includes the weighted average common shares and dilutive share equivalents. Potentially dilutive share equivalents include our Series A convertible preferred shares, employee stock options and restricted share awards, exchangeable and convertible senior debentures, as well as Operating Partnership convertible preferred units.

Fluctuations among quarters resulted primarily from the mark-to-market of derivative instruments, net gains on sale of real estate and wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate and from seasonality of business operations.

The total for the year may differ from the sum of the quarters as a result of weighting.

Segment Information - continued

Notes to preceding tabular information:

(1)

EBITDA represents “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.”  Management considers EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the un-levered performance of its segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)

Interest and debt expense and depreciation and amortization and income tax (benefit) expense in the reconciliation of net income to EBITDA include our share of these items from partially owned entities.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures:  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 (e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:  There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Vornado Realty Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As of December 31, 2007, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 was effective.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the trustees of us; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 197, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board of Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We have audited  the internal control over financial reporting of Vornado Realty Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
    conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
    Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
    to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the
    risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating
    the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
    based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures
    as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
    that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of trustees, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.
