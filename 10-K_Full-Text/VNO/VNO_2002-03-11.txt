      Certain statements contained herein constitute forward-looking
statements as such term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Forward-looking

similar expressions in this annual report on form 10-K. These forward-looking
statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Many
of the factors that will determine these items are beyond our ability to
control or predict. Factors that may cause actual results to differ
materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements include,
but are not limited to, the following: (a) national, regional and local
economic conditions; (b) the continuing impact of the September 11, 2001
terrorist attacks on our tenants and the national, regional and local
economies, including, in particular, the New York City and Washington, D.C.
metropolitan areas; (c) local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a
reduction in demand for real estate in the area; (d) the financial conditions
of tenants; (e) competition from other available space; (f) whether tenants
consider a property attractive; (g) whether we are able to pass some or all
of any increased operating costs we experience through to our tenants; (h)
how well we manage our properties; (i) increased interest expense; (j)
decreases in market rental rates; (k) the timing and costs associated with
property improvements and rentals; (l) changes in taxation or zoning laws;
(m) government regulations; (n) our failure to continue to qualify as a real
estate investment trust; (o) availability of financing on acceptable terms;
(p) potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations; and
(q) general competitive factors.

      For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for
forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this annual
report on Form 10-K or the date of any document incorporated by reference. All
subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any
person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the
cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. We do not
undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to our
forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
this Form 10-K to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Furthermore,
many of these factors may be more likely to occur as a result of the September
11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY

      The Company's business objective is to maximize shareholder value. The
Company intends to achieve its business objective by continuing to pursue its
investment philosophy and executing its operating strategies through:

      o     Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment
            professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;
      o     Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and
            Washington D.C., where the Company believes there is high likelihood
            of capital appreciation;
      o     Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and
            where there is a significant potential for higher rents;
      o     Investing in retail properties in select understored locations such
            as the New York City metropolitan area;
      o     Investing in fully integrated operating companies that have a
            significant real estate component with qualified, experienced
            operating management and strong growth potential which can benefit
            from the Company's access to efficient capital;
      o     Developing/redeveloping the Company's existing properties to
            increase returns and maximize value; and
      o     On occasion, providing specialty financing to real estate companies.

      The Company expects to finance its growth, acquisitions and investments
using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by
accessing the public and private capital markets.

ACQUISITIONS

      On January 1, 2002, the Company acquired the remaining 66% of Charles E.
Smith Commercial Realty ("CESCR") it did not previously own. The consideration
for the remaining 66% of CESCR was approximately $1,600,000,000, consisting of
15.7 million newly issued Vornado Operating Partnership units (valued at
$608,000,000) and acquiring the assets subject to $992,000,000 of debt (66% of
CESCR's total debt). CESCR owns and manages 12.9 million square feet of office
properties in Washington D.C. and Northern Virginia and manages an additional
5.8 million square feet of office and other commercial properties in the
Washington D.C. area.

DISPOSITIONS

      In 2001, the Company sold: (i) its 50% interest in 570 Lexington Avenue
for $60,000,000 resulting in a gain of $12,445,000, (ii) its leasehold interest
in 550/600 Mamaroneck Avenue for $22,500,000 which approximated book value, and
(iii) its 80% interest in 52 condominium units of the total 53 units at the Park
Laurel residential condominium project in New York resulting in an after tax net
gain of $15,657,000.

      Further details of the Company's dispositions are disclosed in
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations in Part II of this document.


                                      -5-


DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

      The following table sets forth certain information for
development/redevelopment projects:



      The above table does not include the capital requirements of Alexander's
and Temperature Controlled Logistics which are described in Item 2: Properties.

      The Company is also in the pre-development phase of a number of projects
including: (i) redevelopment of retail space in the Penn Plaza area, (ii) the
redevelopment of retail space in Crystal City, (iii) the redevelopment of the
former Bradlees building at 14th Street and Union Square to include office
and/or retail space, (iv) the refurbishment of the Hotel Pennsylvania and (v)
the construction of an office tower in excess of 1,000,000 square feet at 20
Times Square (70% interest). Further, the Company is reviewing opportunities in

district.

      There can be no assurance that the above projects will be commenced or
will be successful.


                                      -6-


OPERATIONS OF VORNADO OPERATING COMPANY

      In October 1998, Vornado Operating Company ("Vornado Operating") was spun
off from the Company in order to own assets that the Company could not itself
own and conduct activities that the Company could not itself conduct.

      The Company and Vornado Operating are parties to certain agreements
described below.

      REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT

      Vornado Operating was granted a $75,000,000 unsecured revolving credit
facility from the Company (the "Revolving Credit Agreement") which expires on
December 31, 2004. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest
at LIBOR plus 3%. The Company receives a commitment fee equal to 1% per annum on
the average daily unused portion of the facility. No amortization is required to
be paid under the Revolving Credit Agreement during its term. The Revolving
Credit Agreement prohibits Vornado Operating from incurring indebtedness to
third parties (other than certain purchase money debt and certain other
exceptions) and prohibits Vornado Operating from paying dividends. As of
December 31, 2001, $31,424,000 was outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Agreement.

      AGREEMENT WITH VORNADO OPERATING

      The Company and Vornado Operating are parties to an Agreement pursuant to
which, among other things, (i) the Company will under certain circumstances
offer Vornado Operating an opportunity to become the lessee of certain real
property owned now or in the future by the Company (under mutually satisfactory
lease terms) and (ii) Vornado Operating will not make any real estate investment
or other REIT-Qualified Investment unless it first offers the Company the
opportunity to make such investment and the Company has rejected that
opportunity.

      Under the Agreement, the Company provides Vornado Operating with certain
administrative, corporate, accounting, financial, insurance, legal, tax, data
processing, human resources and operational services. For these services,
Vornado Operating compensates the Company in an amount determined in good faith
by the Company as the amount an unaffiliated third party would charge Vornado
Operating for comparable services and reimburses the Company for certain costs
incurred and paid to third parties on behalf of Vornado Operating. Pursuant to
the Agreement, compensation for such services was approximately $371,000,
$330,000 and $330,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999.

      Vornado Operating and the Company each have the right to terminate the
Agreement if the other party is in material default of the Agreement or upon 90
days written notice to the other party at any time after December 31, 2003. In
addition, the Company has the right to terminate the Agreement upon a change in
control of Vornado Operating.

      VORNADO OPERATING'S MANAGEMENT

      Messrs. Roth, Fascitelli, West and Wight are directors of Vornado
Operating. Mr. Roth is also Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of
Vornado Operating, Mr. Fascitelli is also President of Vornado Operating, and
certain other members of the Company's senior management hold corresponding
positions with Vornado Operating.

      TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED LOGISTICS BUSINESS

      On March 11, 1999, the Vornado/Crescent Partnerships sold all of the
non-real estate assets of Temperature Controlled Logistics encompassing the
operations of the temperature controlled business for approximately $48,700,000
to a new partnership ("AmeriCold Logistics") owned 60% by Vornado Operating
Company and 40% by Crescent Operating Inc. AmeriCold Logistics leases the
underlying temperature controlled warehouses used in this business from the
Vornado/Crescent Partnerships ("the Landlord") which continue to own the real
estate. The leases, as amended, generally have a 15 year term with two-five year
renewal options and provide for the payment of fixed base rent and percentage
rent based on revenue AmeriCold Logistics receives from its customers. On
February 22, 2001, the Landlord restructured the AmeriCold Logistics leases to,
among other things, (i) reduce 2001's contractual rent to $146,000,000, (ii)
reduce 2002's contractual rent to $150,000,000 (plus contingent rent in certain
circumstances), (iii) increase the Landlord's share of annual maintenance
capital expenditures by $4,500,000 to $9,500,000 effective January 1, 2000 and
(iv) allow AmeriCold Logistics to defer rent to December 31, 2003 to the extent
cash is not available, as defined in the leases, to pay such rent. Based on the
Company's policy of recognizing rental income when earned and collection is
assured or cash is received, the Company did not recognize $15,281,000 and
$8,606,000 of the rent it was due in the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.
On December 31, 2001, the Landlord released the tenant from its obligation to
pay $39,812,000 of deferred rent of which the Company's share was $23,887,000.
This amount equals the rent which was not recognized as income by the Company
and accordingly had no profit and loss effect to the Company.

      Vornado Operating has previously disclosed that its investments are not
expected to generate sufficient cash flow to pay all of its expenses for the
foreseeable future. As a result, to enable Vornado Operating to meet its cash
requirements, the Company anticipates that the leases with Vornado Operating's
investee may be restructured to provide additional cash flow and Vornado
Operating's investee may sell non-core assets.


                                      -7-


OTHER INVESTMENTS

      (amounts in thousands)

      The Company's other investments at December 31, 2001 are comprised of:



*     The Company does not have unilateral control over key decisions with
      respect to these partially-owned entities and therefore does not
      consolidate their operations and financial position and applies the equity
      method of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting
      principles. The Company includes its share of partially-owned entities
      debt in reporting its exposure to a change in interest rates under Item 7A
      "Quantitive and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" and in its
      ratio of debt-to-enterprise value as disclosed on page 10. See Note 4 -
      "Investments in Partially-Owned Entities" to the Financial Statements for
      details by investment.

- ----------
(1)   STARWOOD CERUZZI JOINT VENTURE

      The Starwood Ceruzzi Joint Venture was formed in 2000 by the Company, the
      80% non-managing partner, and Starwood Ceruzzi, the 20% managing partner,
      to acquire fee and leasehold interests in properties formerly occupied by
      Hechinger Inc., a home improvement retailer which was liquidated. In the
      first quarter of 2000, the joint venture acquired two fee interests
      containing 210,000 square feet and four leasehold interests containing
      400,000 square feet in properties located in Pennsylvania, Virginia,
      Maryland and Ohio. One of the fee interests was sold in March, 2001 for
      $8,000, resulting in a gain of $1,744 (of which the Company's share was
      $1,395). The venture is redeveloping the remaining properties for retail
      use and will net lease them to tenants. The venture has no debt.

(2)   PARK LAUREL JOINT VENTURE

      The Park Laurel Joint Venture was formed in 1997 to develop a property in
      Manhattan, consisting of 94,000 square feet to be owned and used by the
      YMCA and 119,000 square feet of residential condominiums to be sold by the
      Company and its joint venture partner. Vornado has a 69% interest and
      shares control with its partners. The total cost of the project was
      approximately $109,900. In the third and fourth quarters of 2001, the
      joint venture completed the sale of 52 condominium units of the total
      53 units and received proceeds of $139,548. The Company's share of the
      after tax net gain was $15,657 and is after a charge of $3,953 (net of
      a tax benefit of $1,826) for awards accrued under the venture's incentive
      compensation plan. The credit balance at December 31, 2001 is a result of
      the above mentioned accrual.

(3)   THE PALISADES JOINT VENTURE

      The Palisades Joint Venture was formed in 1999 to develop an 800,000
      square foot high-rise residential tower in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The joint
      venture agreement provides for the Company to contribute 95% of the equity
      and receive 75% of the net profit after a 12% preferred return. The
      estimated total cost of the project is $133,700. Costs incurred to date
      are $122,000, of which $90,500 has been funded by a construction loan,
      $30,000 by the Company and $1,500 by the Company's partner. The property
      is expected to become operational in the Summer of 2002. Upon completion,
      the complex will include a 41-story residential tower containing 538
      apartments and an 800 space parking facility.

(4)   STUDENT HOUSING

      In January 2000, the Company and its joint venture partner acquired a
      252-unit student housing complex in Gainesville, Florida, for
      approximately $27,000. The Company has a 90% interest in the joint
      venture.

(6)   LOAN TO NORTHSTAR PARTNERSHIP, L.P.

      On September 19, 2000, the Company acquired $75,000 of subordinated
      unsecured debt of NorthStar Partnership, L.P., a private real estate
      company, for $65,000. The loan bears interest at 11.5% per annum, requires
      quarterly principal payments of $2,500 and matures in May 2002. All of the
      quarterly principal payments have been received by the Company in
      accordance with the loan agreement with the exception of the payment due
      on September 28, 2001 which was not received until October 30, 2001.

(7)   LOAN TO PRIMESTONE INVESTMENT PARTNERS, L.P.

      On September 28, 2000, the Company made a $62,000 loan to Primestone
      Investment Partners, L.P. The Company received a 1% upfront fee and is
      entitled to receive certain other fees aggregating approximately 3% upon
      repayment of the loan. The loan bears interest at 16% per annum.
      Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. defaulted on the repayment of this
      loan on October 25, 2001. The Company's loan was subordinate to $37,957 of
      other debt of the borrower. On October 31, 2001, the Company purchased the
      other debt for its face amount. The loans are secured by 7,944,893
      partnership units in Prime Group Realty, L.P., the operating partnership
      of Prime Group Realty Trust (NYSE:PGE), which units are exchangeable for
      the same number of shares of PGE. The loans are also guaranteed by
      affiliates of the borrower. The Company has commenced foreclosure
      proceedings with respect to the collateral.

      On November 19, 2001 the Company sold, pursuant to a participation
      agreement with a subsidiary of Cadim inc., a Canadian pension fund, a 50%
      participation in both loans at par for approximately $50,000 reducing the
      Company's net investment in the loans at December 31, 2001 to $56,768,
      including unpaid interest and fees of $6,790. Under the terms of the
      participation agreement, cash payments received shall be applied (i)
      first, to the reimbursement of reimbursable out-of-pocket costs and
      expenses incurred in connection with the servicing, administration or
      enforcement of the loans after November 19, 2001, (ii) second, to the
      Company and Cadim pro rata in proportion to the amount of interest and
      fees owed to them (all of such fees and interest accrued through November
      19, 2001 are for the account of Vornado and all of such fees and interest
      accrued after November 19, 2001 accrue on a 50/50 basis to the Company and
      Cadim) and (iii) third, 50% to the Company and 50% to Cadim. The Company
      has agreed that in the event the Company acquires the collateral in a
      foreclosure proceeding it will, upon the request of Cadim, deliver 50% of
      such collateral to Cadim.

      For financial reporting purposes, the gross amount of the loan, $106,768,
      is included in "Notes and mortgage loans receivable" and Cadim's 50%
      participation, $50,000, is reflected in "Other liabilities". The Company
      did not recognize income on these loans for the period from November 19,
      2001 through December 31, 2001, and will not recognize income until such
      time that cash is received or foreclosure proceedings have been
      consummated. The Company believes that the value of the collateral and the
      guarantees is sufficient to cover the carrying amount of the loans
      receivable including unpaid interest and fees (See Item. 3 - "Legal
      Proceedings").

(8)   DEARBORN CENTER

      The Company's investment of $21,522 represents a 38.5% interest in $55,901
      funded of a $65,000 mezzanine loan to an entity whose sole asset is
      Dearborn Center, a 1.5 million square foot high-rise office tower
      under construction in Chicago. The entity is owned by Prime Group
      Realty L.P. and another investor. The Company is a member of a
      loan syndicate led by a money center bank. The proceeds of the loan are
      being used to finance the construction, and are subordinate to a $225,000
      first mortgage. The loan is due January 21, 2004, three years from the
      date of the initial draw, and provides for a 1 year extension at the
      borrower's option (assuming net operating income at a specified level and
      a cash reserve sufficient to fund interest for the extension period). The
      loan bears interest at 12% per annum plus additional interest ranging from
      a minimum of 9.5% to a maximum of 13% if certain leasing thresholds are
      not met.

(9)   CAPI

      In March 1999, in connection with the Company's acquisition of land under
      certain of the CESCR office properties from CAPI, the Company made a
      $41,200 loan to CAPI, which matures in June 2004. Interest on the loan
      was 8.5% at December 31, 2001. The loan is secured by approximately
      1,100,000 units of Vornado Realty, L.P. Series E-1 Convertible Preferred
      Units (with a liquidation value of $55,000 at December 31, 2001) issued to
      CAPI in connection with the acquisition. Each Series E-1 Unit is
      convertible into 1.1364 shares of Vornado Realty Trust.

resulting in net proceeds of approximately $43,875,000.

      On November 19, 2001, the Company sold 9,775,000 common shares pursuant to
an effective registration statement based on the closing price of $40.58 on the

and 514,200 shares to a unit investment trust based on the closing price of
$42.96 on the NYSE. The net proceeds to the Company were approximately
$57,042,000.

      In addition, the Company completed property level financings of
$254,000,000 in 2001.

      Further details of the Company's financing activities are disclosed in
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations in Part II of this document.

      At December 31, 2001, the ratio of debt-to-enterprise value (market equity
value plus debt less cash) was 38% based on debt of $3.6 billion, including the
Company's proportionate share of debt of partially-owned non-consolidated
entities. In the future, in connection with its strategy for growth, this
percentage may change. The Company's policy concerning the incurrence of debt
may be reviewed and modified from time to time without the vote of shareholders.

      The Company may seek to obtain funds through equity offerings, debt
financings or asset sales, although there is no express policy with respect
thereto. The Company may offer its shares or Operating Partnership units in
exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise re-acquire its shares or
any other securities in the future.

EBITDA BY SEGMENT AND REGION

      The following table sets forth the percentage of the Company's EBITDA(1)
by segment and region for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999. The
proforma column gives effect to the January 1, 2002 acquisition by the Company
of the remaining 66% interest in CESCR described previously, as if it had
occurred on January 1, 2001.



- ----------
(1)   EBITDA represents income before interest, taxes, depreciation and
      amortization, extraordinary or non-recurring items, gains on sales of
      depreciable real estate, the effect of straight-lining of property rentals
      for rent escalations and minority interest. Management considers EBITDA a
      supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the performance of
      its segments. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
      employed by other companies.
(2)   Other includes the Temperature Controlled Logistics segment which has
      warehouse facilities in 33 states and Alberta, Canada. See page 36 for
      details.

ALEXANDER'S

      The Company owns 33.1% of the outstanding shares of common stock of
Alexander's. See "Interstate Properties" below for a description of Interstate's
ownership of the Company and Alexander's.

      Alexander's has seven properties (see Item 2. Properties--Alexander's).

      At December 31, 2001, the Company had loans receivable from Alexander's of
$119,000,000, including $24,000,000 drawn under the $50,000,000 line of credit
the Company granted to Alexander's on August 1, 2000. The maturity date of the
loan and the line of credit were extended to April 15, 2003. The interest rates
on the loan and line of credit will reset on March 15, 2002, and quarterly
thereafter, using the same spread to treasuries as presently exists with a 3%
floor for treasuries.

      The Company manages, develops and leases the Alexander's properties under
a management and development agreement (the "Management Agreement") and a
leasing agreement (the "Leasing Agreement") pursuant to which the Company
receives annual fees from Alexander's. These agreements have a one-year term
expiring in March of each year and are automatically renewable. See Item 2 -
"Properties" for a description of Alexander's properties and development and
redevelopment projects.

      Alexander's common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol "ALX".

INTERSTATE PROPERTIES

      As of December 31, 2001, Interstate Properties and its partners owned
approximately 15.5% of the common shares of beneficial interest of the Company,
27.5% of Alexander's common stock and beneficial ownership of 17.8% of Vornado

David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners. Mr. Roth is the
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the Managing
General Partner of Interstate Properties, and the Chief Executive Officer and a
director of both Alexander's and Vornado Operating. Mr. Wight is a trustee of
the Company and is also a director of both Alexander's and Vornado Operating.
Mr. Mandelbaum is a trustee of the Company and is also a director of
Alexander's.

COMPETITION

      The Company's business segments, Office, Retail, Merchandise Mart
Properties, Temperature Controlled Logistics, and Other operate in highly
competitive environments. The Company has a large concentration of properties in
the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, D.C. and Northern
Virginia area. The Company competes with a large number of real estate property
owners and developers. Principal factors of competition are rent charged,
attractiveness of location and the quality and breadth of services provided. The
Company's success depends upon, among other factors, the trends of the national
and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current
and prospective tenants and customers, the availability and cost of capital,
construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation
and population trends.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

      The Company's operations and properties are subject to a variety of
environmental laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which it
operates governing, among other things, soil and groundwater contamination, the
use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances, air emissions, wastewater
discharges, and employee health and safety. Under various Federal and state laws
and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be
required to investigate and clean up hazardous substances released at a property
and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property
damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by
the parties in connection with the contamination. These laws can impose
liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused,
the release of such substances. The presence of contamination or the failure to
remediate contamination may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or
lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other
Federal, state and local laws and regulations require abatement or removal of
asbestos-containing materials that are damaged, decayed or distributed by
demolition, renovation or remodeling. The laws also govern emissions of and
exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. Air emissions, waste-water discharges,
the maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment
containing polychlorinated-biphenyls (PCBs), and the operation and subsequent
removal of underground storage tanks are also regulated by Federal and state
laws. In connection with the ownership, operation and management of its
properties, the Company could be held liable for the costs of remedial action
with respect to such regulated substances and tanks and related claims for
personal injury, property damage or fines.


                                      -11-


      Each of the Company's properties has been subjected to varying degrees of
environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not
reveal any material environmental condition. However, there can be no assurance
that the identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of
contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the
discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup or compliance requirements
would not result in significant costs to the Company.

INSURANCE

      The Company carries comprehensive liability and all risk property
insurance (fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance) with
respect to its assets. The Company's all risk insurance policies in effect
before September 11, 2001 included coverage for terrorist acts, except for acts
of war. Since September 11, 2001, insurance companies are excluding terrorists
acts from coverage in all risk policies. In 2002, the Company has been unable to
obtain all risk insurance which includes coverage for terrorists acts for
policies it has renewed including the New York City Office portfolio and may not
be able to obtain such coverage for any of its other properties in the future.
Therefore, the risk of financial loss in the case of terrorist acts is the
Company's, which loss could be material.

      The Company's debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by
its properties (which are generally non-recourse to the Company) and its
revolving credit agreement, contain customary covenants requiring the Company to
maintain insurance. There can be no assurance that the lenders under these
instruments will not take the position that an exclusion from all risk insurance
coverage for losses due to terrorist acts is a breach of these debt instruments
that allows the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate repayment
of debt. In addition, if lenders insist on coverage for these risks, it could
adversely affect the Company's ability to finance and/or refinance its
properties and to expand its portfolio.

CERTAIN ACTIVITIES

      Acquisitions and investments are not required to be based on specific
allocation by type of property. The Company has historically held its properties
for long-term investment; however, it is possible that properties in the
portfolio may be sold in whole or in part, as circumstances warrant, from time
to time. Further, the Company has not adopted a policy that limits the amount or
percentage of assets which would be invested in a specific property. While the
Company may seek the vote of its shareholders in connection with any particular
material transaction, generally the Company's activities are reviewed and may be
modified from time to time by its Board of Trustees without the vote of
shareholders.

EMPLOYEES

      The Company has approximately 1,446 employees consisting of 306 in the
Office Properties segment (including 210 as a result of the CESCR acquisition),
39 in the Retail Properties segment, 487 in the Merchandise Mart Properties
segment, 456 at the Hotel Pennsylvania and 158 corporate staff. This does not
include employees of partially-owned entities.

SEGMENT DATA

      The Company operates in four business segments: Office Properties, Retail
Properties, Merchandise Mart Properties and Temperature Controlled Logistics.
The Company engages in no foreign operations other than one temperature
controlled warehouse in Canada.

tenants. Leases typically provide for step-ups in rent periodically over the
term of the lease and pass through to tenants the tenant's share of increases in
real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year. Electricity is
provided to tenants on a submetered basis or included in rent based on surveys
and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases. Leases also typically
provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant's
initial construction costs of its premises.

RETAIL

      The Company owns 55 shopping center properties of which 52 are strip
shopping centers primarily located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, two
are regional malls located in San Juan, Puerto Rico and one, the Green Acres
Mall, is a super-regional mall located in Nassau County, Long Island, New York.
The Company's shopping centers are generally located on major regional highways
in mature, densely populated areas. The Company believes its shopping centers
attract consumers from a regional, rather than a neighborhood market place
because of their location on regional highways.

      The following table sets forth the percentage of the Retail Portfolio
rentals by tenants' industry:



      As of February 1, 2002, the occupancy rate of the retail properties was
91%. The following tables set forth the occupancy rate and the average annual
base rent per square foot (excluding the Green Acres Mall) for the retail
properties at the end of each of the past five years.



      The average annual base rent per square foot for the Green Acres Mall was
$13.98 and $13.97 including the anchor tenants, and $35.98 and $35.91 for mall
tenants only, at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

      The Company's shopping center lease terms range from 5 years or less in
some instances, for smaller tenant spaces to as long as 25 years for major
tenants. Leases generally provide for additional rents based on a percentage of
tenants' sales and pass through to tenants of the tenants' share of all common
area charges (including roof and structure in strip shopping centers, unless it
is the tenant's direct responsibility), real estate taxes and insurance costs
and certain capital expenditures. Percentage rent accounted for less than 2% of
total shopping center revenues in 2001. None of the tenants in the Retail
Segment accounted for more than 10% of the Company's total revenues.


                                      -23-


      Below is a listing of tenants which accounted for 2% or more of the Retail
property revenues in 2001:



      In February 2001, Bradlees, which was in Chapter 11, closed all of its
stores including the 16 locations it leased from the Company. Three of the
former Bradlees leases were assigned and 13 were rejected. Of the 16 locations,
the leases for 13 are fully guaranteed (6 of these guarantees expire in 2002)
and one is guaranteed as to 70% by Stop & Shop, under a Master Agreement and
Guaranty dated May 1, 1992. Stop & Shop is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
KoninKlijke Ahold NV (formerly Royal Ahold NV), a leading international food
retailer. In addition, Stop & Shop also guarantees four other leases which were
rejected in a prior Bradlees bankruptcy (three of which have been assigned). The
effectiveness of Stop & Shop's guarantee is not affected by Bradlees' bankruptcy
or subsequent lease assignments. Annual property rentals at December 31, 2001,
include an aggregate of $4,000,000 of additional rent allocated to the former
Bradlees locations in East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and
Woodbridge in accordance with the Master Agreement and Guaranty. This rent will
be reallocated to other locations guaranteed by Stop & Shop at or prior to the
applicable expiration dates of such leases.

      The following table sets forth as of December 31, 2001 lease expirations
for each of the next 10 years assuming that none of the tenants exercise their
renewal options.

      In 2001, approximately 417,000 square feet of retail space was leased at a
weighted average base rent per square foot of $16.54, a 21.8% increase over the
weighted average escalated rent per square foot of $13.58 for the expiring
leases. Following is the detail by property:



- ----------
(1)   Most leases include periodic step-ups in rent, which are not reflected in
      the initial rent per square foot leased.

      The Company's strip shopping centers are substantially (over 80%) leased
to large stores (over 20,000 square feet). Tenants include destination retailers
such as discount department stores, supermarkets, home improvements stores,
discount apparel stores, membership warehouse clubs and "category killers."
Category killers are large stores which offer a complete selection of a category
of items (e.g., toys, office supplies, etc.) at low prices, often in a warehouse
format. Tenants typically offer basic consumer necessities such as food, health
and beauty aids, moderately priced clothing, building materials and home
improvement supplies, and compete primarily on the basis of price.

      The Company has two regional malls in Puerto Rico, both of which are in
the San Juan area. The Montehiedra Mall contains 525,000 square feet and is
anchored by Home Depot, Kmart and Marshalls. The Las Catalinas Mall contains
482,000 square feet and is anchored by Kmart and Sears. The Company has a 50%
interest in 343,000 square feet of the mall (excludes Sears space).

      The Green Acres Mall is a 1.6 million square foot super-regional enclosed
shopping mall complex situated in Nassau County, Long Island, New York,
approximately one mile east of the borough of Queens, New York. The Green Acres
Mall is anchored by four major department stores: three of which, Sears, Roebuck
and Co., J.C. Penney Company, Inc. and Federated Department Stores, Inc.
("Federated") doing business as Macy's, are operating and the fourth, also
leased to Federated (previously occupied by Stern's), is currently dark,
however, Federated continues to pay the rent. The complex also includes The
Plaza at Green Acres, a 188,000 square foot strip shopping center which is
anchored by Kmart and Waldbaums. Kmart, which filed for protection under Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, has announced the closing of this store.

      The following table sets forth the percentage of the Merchandise Mart
Properties office revenues by tenants' industry during 2001:



The average lease term ranges from 3 to 5 years for smaller tenants to as long
as 15 years for major tenants. Leases typically provide for step-ups in rent
periodically over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants the tenants'
share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses for a building
over a base year. Electricity is provided to tenants on a submetered basis or
included in rent based on surveys and adjusted for subsequent utility rate
increases. Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for
all or a portion of the tenant's initial construction of its premises. None of
the tenants in the Merchandise Mart Properties segment accounted for more than
10% of the Company's total revenue. Below is a listing of the Merchandise Mart
Properties office tenants which accounted for 2% or more of the Merchandise Mart

                                      -35-


TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED LOGISTICS

      The Company has a 60% interest in the Vornado/Crescent Partnerships ("the
Landlord") that own 89 refrigerated warehouses with an aggregate of
approximately 445 million cubic feet. AmeriCold Logistics leases all of the
partnerships' facilities. The Temperature Controlled Logistics segment is
headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.

      On March 11, 1999, the Vornado/Crescent Partnerships sold all of the
non-real estate assets of Temperature Controlled Logistics encompassing the
operations of the temperature controlled business for approximately $48,700,000
to a new partnership ("AmeriCold Logistics") owned 60% by Vornado Operating
Company and 40% by Crescent Operating Inc. AmeriCold Logistics leases the
underlying temperature controlled warehouses used in this business from the
Vornado/Crescent Partnerships ("the Landlord") which continue to own the real
estate. The leases, as amended, generally have a 15 year term with two-five year
renewal options and provide for the payment of fixed base rent and percentage
rent based on revenue AmeriCold Logistics receives from its customers. On
February 22, 2001, the Landlord restructured the AmeriCold Logistics leases to,
among other things, (i) reduce 2001's contractual rent to $146,000,000, (ii)
reduce 2002's contractual rent to $150,000,000 (plus contingent rent in certain
circumstances), (iii) increase the Landlord's share of annual maintenance
capital expenditures by $4,500,000 to $9,500,000 effective January 1, 2000 and
(iv) allow AmeriCold Logistics to defer rent to December 31, 2003 to the extent
cash is not available, as defined in the leases, to pay such rent. Based on the
Company's policy of recognizing rental income when earned and collection is
assured or cash is received, the Company did not recognize $15,281,000 and
$8,606,000 of the rent it was due in the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.
On December 31, 2001 the Landlord released the tenant from its obligation to pay
$39,812,000 of deferred rent of which the Company's share was $23,887,000. This
amount equals the rent which was not recognized as income by the Company and
accordingly had no profit and loss effect to the Company.

      During 2001, the Landlord completed a 125,000 square foot warehouse at its
Atlanta, Georgia complex and has acquired the original 104,000 square foot
warehouse in Tarboro, North Carolina, which is subject to a capital lease. These
transactions were completed at a total cost of $25,807,000.

      AmeriCold Logistics provides the frozen food industry with refrigerated
warehousing and transportation management services. Refrigerated warehouses are
comprised of production and distribution facilities. Production facilities
typically serve one or a small number of customers, generally food processors,
located nearby. These customers store large quantities of processed or partially
processed products in the facility until they are shipped to the next stage of
production or distribution. Distribution facilities primarily warehouse a wide
variety of customers' finished products until future shipment to end-users. Each
distribution facility generally services the surrounding regional market.
AmeriCold Logistics' transportation management services include freight routing,
dispatching, freight rate negotiation, backhaul coordination, freight bill
auditing, network flow management, order consolidation and distribution channel
assessment. AmeriCold Logistics' temperature-controlled logistics expertise and
access to both frozen food warehouses and distribution channels enable its
customers to respond quickly and efficiently to time-sensitive orders from
distributors and retailers.

      AmeriCold Logistics' customers consist primarily of national, regional and
local frozen food manufacturers, distributors, retailers and food service
organizations. A breakdown of AmeriCold Logistics' largest customers during 2001
include:

ALEXANDER'S PROPERTIES

      The Company owns 33.1% of Alexander's outstanding common shares. The
following table shows the location, approximate size and leasing status of each
of the properties owned by Alexander's as of December 31, 2001.



- ----------
(1)   Excludes parking garages.
(2)   Excludes 339,000 square foot Macy's store, owned and operated by Federated
      Department Stores, Inc.
(3)   Leased by the Company through January 2027.
(4)   On October 5, 2001, Alexander's entered into a ground lease for its
      Paramus, N.J. property with IKEA Property, Inc. The lease has a 40-year
      term with an option to purchase at the end of the 20th year for
      $75,000,000. Further, Alexander's has obtained a $68,000,000 interest
      only, non-recourse mortgage loan on the property from a third party
      lender. The interest rate on the debt is 5.92% with interest payable
      monthly until maturity in October, 2011. The triple net rent each year is
      the sum of $700,000 plus the amount of debt service on the mortgage loan.
      If the purchase option is not exercised at the end of the 20th year, the
      triple net rent for the last 20 years must include debt service sufficient
      to fully amortize the $68,000,000 over the remaining 20 year lease period.

(5)   Alexander's has completed the excavation and foundation for its Lexington
      Avenue property development project. The development plan is to construct
      a 1.4 million square foot multi-use building comprised of a commercial
      portion, which may include a combination of retail stores and offices, and
      a residential portion consisting of condominium units. There can be no
      assurance that the residential portion will be built. The funding required
      for the proposed building will be in excess of $650,000,000. Alexander's
      is exploring various alternatives for financing the project, including
      equity, debt, joint ventures and asset sales, which may involve
      arrangements with the Company.

      On May 1, 2001 Alexander's entered into a lease agreement with Bloomberg
      L.P. for approximately 700,000 square feet of office space. The initial
      term of the lease is for 25 years, with one ten-year renewal option. Base
      annual net rent is $34,221,000 in each of the first four years and
      $38,226,000 in the fifth year with a similar percentage increase each four
      years thereafter. There can be no assurance that this project ultimately
      will be completed, completed on time or completed for the budgeted amount.
      If the project is not completed on a timely basis, the lease may be
      cancelled by the tenant and significant penalties may apply.

      On January 12, 2001, Alexander's sold its Fordham Road property located in
the Bronx, New York for $25,500,000, which resulted in a gain of $19,026,000. In
addition, Alexander's paid off the mortgage on this property at a discount,
which resulted in an extraordinary gain from early extinguishment of debt of
$3,534,000 in the first quarter of 2001.

      THE NEWKIRK MASTER LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

      In 1998, the Company and affiliates of Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund
III, L.P. ("Apollo") formed a joint venture to acquire general and limited
partnership interests in the Newkirk real estate partnerships. Since its
formation, the joint venture has acquired equity interests in 91 partnerships
which own approximately 19.7 million square feet of real estate and first and
second mortgages secured by a portion of these properties. The Company owned a
30% interest in the joint venture with the balance owned by Apollo. On January
1, 2002, the Newkirk partnerships were merged into The Newkirk Master Limited
Partnership (the "MLP") to create a vehicle to enable the partners to have
greater access to capital and future investment opportunities. In connection
with the merger, the Company received limited partner interests in the MLP equal
to an approximate 21.1% interest and Apollo received limited partner interests
in the MLP equal to an approximate 54.5% interest. Further, the joint venture is
the general partner of the MLP.

      The Company's investment in the joint venture at December 31, 2001 was
comprised of:



      The Company's share of the joint venture debt was approximately
$263,952,000 at December 31, 2001.

      In conjunction with the merger, the MLP completed a $225,000,000 secured
financing collateralized by its interests in the entities that own the
properties, subject to the existing first and certain second mortgages on those
properties. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 5.5% with a LIBOR floor of 3%
(8.5% at February 1, 2002) and matures on January 31, 2005, with two one-year
extension options. As a result of the financing, on February 6, 2002 the MLP
repaid approximately $28,200,000 of existing joint venture debt and distributed
approximately $37,000,000 to the Company.

      The following table sets forth a summary of the real estate owned by the
MLP and the Company's interest therein:



      As of February 1, 2002, the occupancy rate of the properties was 100%.


                                      -43-


      The primary lease terms range from 20 to 25 years from their original
commencement dates with rents, typically above market, which fully amortize the
first mortgage debt on the properties. In addition, tenants generally have
multiple renewal options, with rents, on average, below market.

      Below is a listing of tenants which accounted for 2% or more of Newkirk
Partnership's revenues in 2001:



      ----------
      (1)   On February 12, 2002, Kaiser Aluminum, which leases an office
            building located in Oakland, California filed for protection under
            Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. To date, this lease has not
            been assumed or rejected.

opposite Madison Square Garden and consists of a hotel portion containing
1,000,000 square feet of hotel space with 1,700 rooms and a commercial portion
containing 400,000 square feet of retail and office space.

      The Hotel occupancy which is dependent on the travel industry was severely
impacted by the events of September 11, 2001, accelerating a trend which began
in the first quarter of 2001. Average occupancy for December 2001 was 53% as
compared to 71% in December 2000. REVPAR was $52 in December 2001 as compared to
$87 in December 2000.

      The following table presents rental information for the Hotel:



      As of December 31, 2001, the property's retail and office space was 56%
and 61% occupied. 25 tenants occupy the retail and office space. Annual rent per
square foot of retail and office space in 2001 was $50 and $21 compared to $45
and $17 in 2000.

DRY WAREHOUSE/INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES

      The Company's dry warehouse/industrial properties consist of eight
buildings in New Jersey containing approximately 2.0 million square feet. At
February 1, 2002 the occupancy rate of the properties was 99%. The average term
of a tenant's lease is three to five years.

      The following table sets forth the occupancy rate and average annual rent
per square foot at the end of each of the past three years.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

      The Company is from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of management, after
consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including in
respect of the matter referred to below, is not expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operation.

      On October 25, 2001, Primestone Investment Partners L.P. ("Primestone")
defaulted on the repayment of its loan from the Company (See Item. 1 page 9
Other Investments - Loan to Primestone Investment Partners L.P.). On November
19, 2001, the Company commenced an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery
against Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. in connection with foreclosure
proceedings with respect to the collateral under the loan agreement. Although
Primestone is a special purpose entity with only one asset, units in Prime
Group Realty, L.P., no operations, no employees and no operating income, it
filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on November 19, 2001 in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The Company moved to
dismiss Primestone's petition as bad faith filing. Federal bankruptcy judge
granted the Company's motion on December 18, 2001.

     Following the bankruptcy court's dismissal of Primestone's petition, the
Company attempted to reschedule the auction for January 25, 2002. Primestone
appealed to the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,
and the auction was stayed pending appeal. On January 28, 2002, the district
court affirmed the bankruptcy court's decision. The Company has since
attempted to reschedule the auction for a third time, but Primestone has
appealed once again, this time to the United States Court of Appeals.
Briefing for the appeal concluded on February 25, 2002 and the parties are
currently awaiting a decision as to if and when oral argument will occur.

    On February 13, 2002, Primestone counterclaimed against the Company. In
the counterclaim, Primestone alleges that the Company tortiously interfered
with a prospective contract with Cadim, inc. Primestone alleges that the
failure to consummate this alleged contract deprived it of the ability to
repay its loans to the Company, and that the Company is attempting to obtain
control of Prime Group Realty Trust, a publicly held affiliate of Primestone,
at an artificially low price. Primestone seeks equitable relief, including a
permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from foreclosing on collateral
pledged by Primestone, and also demands damages totaling $150,000,000 plus
costs and attorneys' fees. The parties commenced discovery on an expedited
basis in preparation for a hearing on Primestone's motion for a preliminary
injunction that was scheduled for February 22, 2002, but Primestone has
indicated that it intends not to proceed with that motion in light of a stay
granted by the United States Court of Appeals in Primestone's appeal from the
dismissal of its bankruptcy case. On March 4, 2002 the Company filed an
answer denying the essential allegations of the counterclaim.

                                      -52-


ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

      No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of the year ended December 31, 2001.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

      The following is a list of the names, ages, principal occupations and
positions with Vornado of the executive officers of Vornado and the positions

                                     PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

      Vornado's common shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol "VNO".

      Quarterly price ranges of the common shares and dividends paid per share
for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 were as follows:



- ----------
*     Comprised of a regular quarterly dividend of $.66 per share and a special
      dividend of $.31 declared on December 18, 2001, which was necessary to
      avoid the Company incurring an excise tax on distributions of less than
      85% of taxable income in the current year.

      On March 1, 2002, the number of record holders of common shares of
Vornado was 2,094.

      At December 31, 2001, the Company had a capital loss carryover of
approximately $83,000,000. The capital loss carryover is available to offset
future capital gains that would otherwise be required to be distributed as
dividends to shareholders.


                                      -54-


ITEM 6.  SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA




                                      -55-




- ----------
(1)   All share and per share information has also been adjusted for a 2-for-1
      share split in October 1997.
(2)   Funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating
      activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
      the United States of America and is not necessarily indicative of cash
      available to fund cash needs which is disclosed in the Consolidated
      Statements of Cash Flows for the applicable periods. There are no material
      legal or functional restrictions on the use of funds from operations.
      Funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net
      income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or as an
      alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Management considers
      funds from operations a supplemental measure of operating performance and
      along with cash flow from operating activities, financing activities and
      investing activities, it provides investors with an indication of the
      ability of the Company to incur and service debt, to make capital
      expenditures and to fund other cash needs. Funds from operations may not
      be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs since a
      number of REITs, including the Company, calculate funds from operations in
      a manner different from that used by the National Association of Real
      Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). Funds from operations, as defined by
      NAREIT, represents net income applicable to common shares before
      depreciation and amortization, extraordinary items and gains or losses on
      sales of real estate. Funds from operations as disclosed above has been
      modified from this definition to adjust primarily for (i) the effect of
      straight-lining of property rentals for rent escalations and leasing fee
      income, and (ii) the reversal of income taxes (benefit) which are
      considered non-recurring because of the conversion of Temperature
      Controlled Logistics Companies to REITs in 2000.

OVERVIEW

      The Company has operated over the periods presented in a generally
favorable economic environment, although the Company's operating environment
began to show signs of weakening in the first half of 2001. The Company's
physical properties were not directly affected by the catastrophic events of
September 11, 2001. Demand for New York City office space increased temporarily
as a result of displaced tenants from buildings damaged or destroyed. The
occupancy rate of the Company's New York City office portfolio increased from
95% at June 30, 2001 to 97% at December 31, 2001. The Company has experienced a
significant reduction in occupancy at its Hotel Pennsylvania subsequent to
September 11, 2001 accelerating a trend which began in the first quarter of
2001.

      Substantially all of the Company's office, retail and permanent showroom
leases contain step-ups in rent. Such rental increases are not designed to, and
in many instances do not, approximate the cost of inflation, but do have the
effect of mitigating the adverse impact of inflation. In addition, substantially
all of the Company's leases contain provisions that require the tenant to
reimburse the Company for the tenant's share of common area charges (including
roof and structure in strip shopping centers, unless it is the tenant's direct
responsibility) and real estate taxes or for increases of such expenses over a
base amount, thus offsetting, in part, the effects of inflation on such
expenses.


                                      -58-


      Below is a summary of net income and EBITDA(1) by segment for the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. Prior to 2001, income from the Company's
preferred stock affiliates ("PSAs") was included in income from partially-owned
entities. On January 1, 2001, the Company acquired the common stock of its PSAs
and converted these entities to taxable REIT subsidiaries. Accordingly, the
Hotel portion of the Hotel Pennsylvania and the management companies (which
provide services to the Company's business segments and operate the Trade Show
business of the Merchandise Mart division) have been consolidated effective
January 1, 2001. Amounts for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 have
been reclassified to give effect to the consolidation of these entities, as if
consolidated as of January 1, 1999.



      See Supplemental Information on page 73 for the following data regarding
the fourth quarter of 2001 and 2000: (i) a summary of net income and EBITDA by
segment, (ii) details of the changes by segment in EBITDA and (iii) leasing
activity. Further, the Supplemental Information contains data regarding (i)
leasing activity for the year ended December 31, 2001, (ii) Condensed Proforma
Operating Results for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 giving effect
to the January 1, 2002 acquisition of the remaining 66% of Charles E. Smith
Commercial Realty as if it had occurred on January 1, 2000 and (iii) a summary
of related party disclosures.


                                      -59-





                                      -60-




- ----------
(1)   EBITDA represents income before interest, taxes, depreciation and
      amortization, extraordinary or non-recurring items, gains or losses on
      sales of depreciable real estate, the effect of straight-lining of
      property rentals for rent escalations and minority interest. Management
      considers EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing
      the performance of its segments. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly
      titled measures employed by other companies.
(2)   Includes (i) the reversal of income taxes (benefit) which are considered
      non-recurring because of the conversion of the Temperature Controlled
      Logistics Companies to REITs in 2000 and (ii) the add back of
      non-recurring unification costs.
(3)   Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and
      straight-lining of rents included in the reconciliation of net income to
      EBITDA reflects amounts which are netted in income from partially-owned
      entities.
(4)   Net of $15,281 and $9,787 of rent not recognized as income in 2001 and
      2000, respectively.
(5)   Includes the reversal of $1,266 and $4,765 of expenses in connection with
      a deferred compensation arrangement in 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Other EBITDA is comprised of:



- ----------
(1)   Reflects acquisitions of additional partnership interests.

(2)   Includes leasing fees of $2,500 in connection with Alexander's ground
      lease of its Paramus property to IKEA in the fourth quarter of 2001.

(3)   The commercial portion of the Hotel was wholly-owned as of August 5, 1999,
      and accordingly consolidated.

(4)   Average occupancy and REVPAR for the Hotel Pennsylvania for the year ended
      December 31, 2001 was 63% and $70 compared to 76% and $87 for the year
      ended December 31, 2000.


                                      -61-



      The following table sets forth the percentage of the Company's EBITDA by
segment for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. The Proforma
column gives effect to the January 1, 2002 acquisition by the Company of the
remaining 66% interest in CESCR described previously as if it had occurred on
January 1, 2001.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

      YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND DECEMBER 31, 2000

      Below are the details of the changes by segment in EBITDA.



- ----------
(1)   Represents operations which were owned for the same period in each year.
(2)   EBITDA and the same store percentage increase was $295,222 and 13.7% for
      the New York City office portfolio and $84,943 and 3.6% for the CESCR
      portfolio.
(3)   The Company reflects its 60% share of the Vornado/Crescent Partnerships'
      ("the Landlord") equity in the rental income it receives from AmeriCold
      Logistics, its tenant, which leases the underlying temperature controlled
      warehouses used in its business. On February 22, 2001, the Landlord
      restructured the AmeriCold Logistics leases to among other things, (i)
      reduce 2001's contractual rent to $146,000, (ii) reduce 2002's contractual
      rent to $150,000 (plus additional contingent rent in certain
      circumstances), (iii) increase the Landlord's share of annual maintenance
      capital expenditures by $4,500 to $9,500 effective January 1, 2000 and
      (iv) extend the deferred rent period to December 31, 2003 from March 11,
      2002.

      The tenant has advised the Landlord that (i) its revenue for the year
      ended December 31, 2001 from the warehouses it leases from the Landlord,
      is lower than last year by 4.2% and (ii) its gross profit before rent at
      these warehouses for the corresponding period is lower than last year by
      $26,764 (a 14.4% decline). This decrease is attributable to a reduction in
      total customer inventory stored at the warehouses and customer inventory
      turns.

      Based on the Company's policy of recognizing rental income when earned and
      collection is assured or cash is received, the Company did not recognize
      $15,281 and $8,606 of the rent it was due in the years ended December 31,
      2001 and 2000. On December 31, 2001 the Landlord released the tenant from
      its obligation to pay $39,812 of deferred rent of which the Company's
      share was $23,887. This amount equals the rent which was not recognized as
      income by the Company and accordingly had no profit and loss effect to the
      Company.

(4)   Included in "Other" is $2,422 of interest income from the $31,424 note
      receivable the Company has from Vornado Operating Company ("Vornado
      Operating"). Vornado Operating has only one significant asset, its
      investment in AmeriCold Logistics and does not generate positive cash flow
      sufficient to cover all of its expenses. Accordingly, commencing January
      1, 2002, the Company will no longer recognize the interest income due on
      the $31,424 loan until Vornado Operating is cash flow positive in an
      amount sufficient to fund the interest due to the Company. The Company
      anticipates that the leases with Vornado Operating's investee may be
      restructured to provide additional cash flow and Vornado Operating's
      investee may sell non-core assets.


                                      -62-


REVENUES

      The Company's revenues, which consist of property rentals, tenant expense
reimbursements and other income were $985,773,000 in the year ended December 31,
2001 compared to $926,151,000 in the prior year, an increase of $59,622,000.
These increases by segment resulted from:



- ----------
(1)   Results primarily from the 14th Street and Union Square property being
      taken out of service for redevelopment on February 9, 2001 and the sale of
      the Company's Texas properties on March 2, 2000.
(2)   Results primarily from the termination of the Sports Authority lease at
      the Hotel Pennsylvania in January 2001.
(3)   Average occupancy and REVPAR for the Hotel Pennsylvania were 63% and $70
      for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 76% and $87 for the year ended
      December 31, 2000.
(4)   Reflects a decrease of $2,514 in property rentals arising from the
      straight-lining of rent escalations.

        See Supplemental Information on page 76 for details of leasing activity.


                                      -63-


EXPENSES

      The Company's expenses were $600,626,000 in the year ended December 31,
2001, compared to $551,101,000 in the prior year, an increase of $49,525,000.
This increase by segment resulted from:



- ----------
(1)   Includes $1,900 for the collection of a receivable from a commercial
      tenant of the Hotel in 2001 which was previously fully reserved.

INCOME APPLICABLE TO ALEXANDER'S

      Income applicable to Alexander's (loan interest income, management,
leasing and development fees, equity in income) was $24,548,000 in the year
ended December 31, 2001, compared to $17,363,000 in the prior year, an increase
of $7,185,000. This increase resulted primarily from the Company's share of
Alexander's gain on sale of its Fordham Road property on January 12, 2001.


                                      -64-


INCOME FROM PARTIALLY-OWNED ENTITIES

      In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company
reflects the income it receives from (i) entities it owns less than 50% of and
(ii) entities it owns more than 50% of, but which have a partner who has the
right to exercise significant control, on the equity method of accounting
resulting in such income appearing on one line in the Company's consolidated
statements of income. Below is the detail of income from partially-owned
entities by investment as well as the increase (decrease) in income of
partially-owned entities for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the
prior year:




                                      -65-


INTEREST AND OTHER INVESTMENT INCOME

      Interest and other investment income (interest income on mortgage loans
receivable, other interest income, dividend income and net gains on marketable
securities) was $54,385,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to
$33,798,000 in the prior year, an increase of $20,587,000. This increase
resulted primarily from the acquisition of NorthStar subordinated unsecured debt
(22% effective rate) on September 19, 2000 and a loan to Primestone Investment
Partners, L.P. on September 28, 2000 (20% effective rate).

      On September 28, 2000, the Company made a $62,000,000 loan to
Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. The Company received a 1% upfront fee
and is entitled to receive certain other fees aggregating approximately 3%
upon repayment of the loan. The loan bears interest at 16% per annum.
Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. defaulted on the repayment of this loan
on October 25, 2001. The Company's loan was subordinate to $37,957,000 of
other debt of the borrower. On October 31, 2001, the Company purchased the
other debt for its face amount. The loans are secured by 7,944,893
partnership units in Prime Group Realty, L.P., the operating partnership of
Prime Group Realty Trust (NYSE:PGE), which units are exchangeable for the
same number of shares of PGE. The loans are also guaranteed by affiliates of
the borrower. The Company has commenced foreclosure proceedings with respect
to the collateral.

      On November 19, 2001 the Company sold, pursuant to a participation
agreement with a subsidiary of Cadim inc., a Canadian pension fund, a 50%
participation in both loans at par for approximately $50,000,000 reducing the
Company's net investment in the loans at December 31, 2001 to $56,768,000,
including unpaid interest and fees of $6,790,000. Under the terms of the
participation agreement, cash payments received shall be applied (i) first,
to the reimbursement of reimbursable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the servicing, administration or enforcement of
the loans after November 19, 2001, (ii) second, to the Company and Cadim pro
rata in proportion to the amount of interest and fees owed to them (all of
such fees and interest accrued through November 19, 2001 are for the account
of Vornado and all of such fees and interest accrued after November 19, 2001
accrue on a 50/50 basis to the Company and Cadim) and (iii) third, 50% to the
Company and 50% to Cadim. The Company has agreed that in the event the
Company acquires the collateral in a foreclosure proceeding it will, upon the
request of Cadim, deliver 50% of such collateral to Cadim.

      For financial reporting purposes, the gross amount of the loan,
$106,768,000, is included in "Notes and mortgage loans receivable" and Cadim's
50% participation, $50,000,000, is reflected in "Other liabilities". The
Company did not recognize income on these loans for the period from November
19, 2001 through December 31, 2001, and will not recognize income until such
time that cash is received or foreclosure proceedings have been consummated.
The Company believes that the value of the collateral and the guarantees is
sufficient to cover the carrying amount of the loans receivable including
unpaid interest and fees.

      Included in interest and other investment income for the year ended
December 31, 2001, is $2,422,000 of interest income from the $31,424,000 note
receivable the Company has from Vornado Operating Company ("Vornado Operating").
Vornado Operating has only one significant asset, its investment in AmeriCold
Logistics and does not generate positive cash flow sufficient to cover all of
its expenses. Accordingly, commencing January 1, 2002, the Company will no
longer recognize the interest income due on the $31,424,000 loan until Vornado
Operating is cash flow positive in an amount sufficient to fund the interest due
to the Company.

INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE

      Interest and debt expense was $173,076,000 for the year ended December 31,
2001, compared to $179,380,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $6,304,000. This
decrease resulted primarily from a $36,270,000 savings from a 289 basis point
reduction in weighted average interest rate on variable rate debt partially
offset by interest on higher average outstanding loan balances. Interest and
debt expense includes amortization of debt issuance costs of $8,458,000 and
$7,298,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.


                                      -66-

      The following table sets forth the details of net gain on disposition of
wholly-owned and partially-owned assets for the years ended December 31, 2001
and 2000:



NET GAIN FROM CONDEMNATION PROCEEDING

In September 1998, Atlantic City condemned the Company's property. In the third
quarter of 1998, the Company recorded a gain of $1,694,000, which reflected the
condemnation award of $3,100,000, net of the carrying value of the property of
$1,406,000. The Company appealed the amount and on June 27, 2001, was awarded an
additional $3,050,000, which has been recorded as a gain in the quarter ended

resulting from the write-off of an equity investment in a technology company. In
the second quarter of 2001, the Company recorded an additional charge of
$13,561,000 resulting from the write-off of all of its remaining equity
investments in technology companies due to both the deterioration of the
financial condition of these companies and the lack of acceptance by the market
of certain of their products and services. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the
Company recorded $1,481,000 of income resulting from the reversal of a deferred
rent liability relating to the termination of an agreement permitting one of the
technology companies access to its properties.

550/600 MAMARONECK AVENUE

      On August 6, 2001, the Company sold its leasehold interest in 550/600
Mamaroneck Avenue for $22,500,000, which approximated its net book value.

(69% owned by the Company) completed the sale of 52 condominium units of the
total 53 units and received proceeds of $139,548,000. The Company's share of the

tax benefit of $1,826,000) for awards accrued under the venture's incentive
compensation plan.

      On May 17, 2001, the Company sold its 50% interest in 570 Lexington Avenue

investment of $7,374,000 in RTR based on the operating losses and an assessment

                                      -67-


OTHER

      The Company recorded the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle of $4,110,000 in the first quarter of 2001. The Company had previously
marked-to-market changes in the value of stock purchase warrants through
accumulated other comprehensive loss. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, those changes are
recognized through earnings, and accordingly, the Company has reclassified
$4,110,000 from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the consolidated
statement of income as of January 1, 2001. Future changes in value of such
securities will be recorded through earnings.

      The Company recorded an extraordinary item of $1,170,000 in the first
quarter of 2001 representing the Company's share of Alexander's extraordinary
gain from early extinguishment of debt. The Company incurred an extraordinary
loss of $1,125,000 in the first quarter of 2000 due to the write-off of
unamortized financing costs in connection with the prepayment of debt.

      Minority interest was $112,363,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001,
compared to $102,374,000 for the prior year, an increase of $9,989,000. This
increase is primarily due to an increase in perpetual preferred units
distributions for units issued in 2000 and 2001.

      The Company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to
qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as
amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT
taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets
certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income
which is distributed to its shareholders. The Company has distributed to its
shareholders an amount greater than its taxable income. Therefore, no provision
for Federal income taxes is required.

his employment arrangement, was $13,123,000 ($4,704,000 of which is shown as
a reduction in shareholders' equity). The loan bears interest at 4.49% per
annum (based on the applicable Federal rate) and matures in January 2006. The
Company also provided Mr. Roth with the right to draw up to $15,000,000 of
additional loans on a revolving basis. Each additional loan will bear
interest, payable quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the
loan is made and will mature on the sixth anniversary of the loan.

      At December 31, 2001, loans due from Mr. Fascitelli, in accordance with

(based on the applicable Federal rate).

convertible obligation payable November 30, 2001, at the Company's option in
919,540 of its common shares or the cash equivalent of their appreciated

and Mr. Fascitelli have agreed to extend the deferral period for three
additional years. The Company has funded the obligation in common shares.
Accordingly, the Company has reflected this liability as Deferred
compensation shares not yet delivered in the Equity section of the balance
sheet. The cash and common shares are held in an irrevocable trust (the fair
value of this obligation was $40,155,000 at December 31, 2001). For the years

$4,744,000 and $3,733,000 of compensation expense of which $2,612,000 and

and $2,132,000 and $1,765,000 represented dividends paid on the shares.

      On March 8, 2002, the Company extended its employment agreement with
Mr. Fascitelli for a five year period ending December 31, 2006. Pursuant to
the employment agreement, he will receive a deferred payment in five years of
626,566 Vornado common shares which are valued for compensation purposes at
$27,500,000. The number of shares was set by the Company's Compensation
Committee in December to achieve a value of $25,000,000 and have appreciated
$2,500,000 since then. The shares will vest on December 31, 2002. Mr.
Fascitelli will also receive regular annual cash compensation as determined
by the Company's Compensation Committee and will continue as a member of
Vornado's Board.

      One other executive officer of the Company has a loan outstanding pursuant
to an employment agreement of $1,000,000 at December 31, 2001. The loan matures
in April 2005 and bears interest at either the applicable Federal rate provided
or the broker call rate (6.63% at December 31, 2001).

      Information regarding employment agreements with other Officers of the
Company are incorporated by reference in Part III of this document.

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus 3%.
The Company receives a commitment fee equal to 1% per annum on the average daily
unused portion of the facility. No amortization is required to be paid under the
Revolving Credit Agreement during its term. The Revolving Credit Agreement
prohibits Vornado Operating from incurring indebtedness to third parties (other

was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement.

      FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000

      Funds from operations was $376,523,000 in the year ended December 31,
2001, compared to $335,158,000 in the prior year, an increase of $41,365,000.
Funds from operations for the year ended December 31, 2001, includes (i) a
$15,657,000 after tax net gain on sale of Park Laurel condominium units, (ii)
$29,110,000 (1) for write-offs of investments and other deferred costs and (iii)
$1,250,000 for donations to the Twin Towers Fund and the NYC Fireman's Fund.
Funds from operations before these items and after minority interest was
$389,426,000, a $54,268,000 increase over the prior year, or a 12.7% increase on
a per share basis.

      The following table reconciles funds from operations and net income:



The number of shares that can be used for determining funds from operations
per share is as follows:



- ----------
(1)   Write-off of investments and other deferred costs in 2001 include:



(2)   See note on following page for Reconciliation of Funds from Operations as
      shown above to the Operating Partnership's funds from operations.


                                      -82-


      Funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating
activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to
fund cash needs which is disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
for the applicable periods. There are no material legal or functional
restrictions on the use of funds from operations. Funds from operations should
not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the
Company's operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure
of liquidity. Management considers funds from operations a supplemental measure
of operating performance and along with cash flow from operating activities,
financing activities and investing activities, it provides investors with an
indication of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt, to make
capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs. Funds from operations may not
be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs since a
number of REITs, including the Company, calculate funds from operations in a
manner different from that used by NAREIT. Funds from operations, as defined by
NAREIT, represents net income applicable to common shares before depreciation
and amortization, extraordinary items and gains or losses on sales of real
estate. Funds from operations as disclosed above has been modified from this
definition to adjust primarily for (i) the effect of straight-lining of property
rentals for rent escalations and leasing fee income, and (ii) the reversal of
income taxes (benefit) which are considered non-recurring because of the
conversion of Temperature Controlled Logistics Companies to REITs in 2000.

      Below are the cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and
financing activities:



      Assuming all of the convertible units of the Operating Partnership were
converted to shares, the minority interest in partnership earnings would not be
deducted in calculating funds from operations and the shares used in calculating
funds from operations per share would be increased to reflect the conversion.
Funds from operations per share would not change. The following table reconciles
funds from operations as shown above, to the Operating Partnership's funds from
operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000:



      The number of shares to be used for determining Operating Partnership
funds from operations per share is as follows:



      See supplemental information on page 76 for Condensed Pro forma Operating
Results for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 giving effect to the
January 1, 2002 acquisition by the Company of the remaining 66% of Charles E.
Smith Commercial Realty as if it had occurred on January 1, 2000.


                                      -83-


ACQUISITION ACTIVITY, CERTAIN CASH REQUIREMENTS AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES

      ACQUISITION ACTIVITY

      On January 1, 2002, the Company acquired the remaining 66% of CESCR it did
not previously own. The consideration for the remaining 66% of CESCR was
approximately $1,600 million, consisting of 15.7 million newly issued Vornado
Operating Partnership units (valued at $608 million) and acquiring the assets
subject to $992 million of debt (66% of CESCR's total debt). CESCR owns and
manages 12.9 million square feet office properties in Washington D.C. and
Northern Virginia and manages an additional 5.8 million square feet of office
and other commercial properties in the Washington D.C. area.

      The Company's future success will be affected by its ability to integrate
the assets and businesses it acquires and to effectively manage those assets and
businesses. The Company currently expects to continue to grow. However, its
ability to do so will be dependent on a number of factors, including, among
others, (a) the availability of reasonably priced assets that meet the Company's
acquisition criteria and (b) the price of the Company's common shares, the rates
at which the Company is able to borrow money and, more generally, the
availability of financing on terms that, in the Company's view, make such
acquisitions financially attractive.

      CERTAIN CASH REQUIREMENTS

      For 2002, the Company has budgeted approximately $172.6 million for
capital expenditures (excluding acquisitions) and leasing commissions as
follows:



      Tenant allowances and leasing commissions for the New York City Office
properties approximate $23.00 per square foot for renewal space and $48.00 per
square foot for vacant space. Historically, approximately two-thirds of existing
tenants renew their leases.

- ----------
(1)   Represents the Company's 60% share of the Vornado/Crescent Partnerships
      obligation to fund $9,500 of capital expenditures per annum.
(2)   Primarily for the Hotel Pennsylvania.

      In addition to the capital expenditures reflected above, the Company is
currently engaged in or considering certain development and redevelopment
projects for which it has budgeted approximately $158.4 million to be expended
as outlined in the "Development and Redevelopment Projects" section of Item
1--Business. The $158.4 million does not include amounts for other projects
which are also included in the "Development and Redevelopment Projects" section
of Item 1 -Business, as no budgets for them have been finalized. There can be no
assurance that any of the above projects will be ultimately completed, completed
on time or completed for the budgeted amount.

      No cash requirements have been budgeted for the capital expenditures and
amortization of debt of Alexander's, or The Newkirk MLP, which are partially
owned by the Company. These investees are expected to fund their own cash
requirements. Alexander's is prohibited by its loan agreements from paying
dividends. In 2002 the Company expects to receive distributions of approximately
$44.2 million from its investment in The Newkirk MLP, including the distribution
of approximately $37 million received on February 6, 2002, in connection with a
Newkirk refinancing.


                                      -84-


FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

      Below is a schedule of the Company's contractual obligations and
commitments at December 31, 2001:



      The Company is reviewing various alternatives for the repayment or
refinancing of debt coming due during 2002. The Company has $1 billion available
under its revolving credit facility which matures in March, 2003 and a number of
properties which are unencumbered.

      The Company's credit facility contains customary conditions precedent to
borrowing such as the bring down of customary representations and warranties as
well as compliance with financial covenants such as minimum interest coverage
and maximum debt to market capitalization. The facility provides for higher
interest rates in the event of a decline in the Company's ratings below
Baa3/BBB. This facility also contains customary events of default which could
give rise to acceleration and include such items as failure to pay interest or
principal and breaches of financial covenants such as maintenance of minimum
capitalization and minimum interest coverage.

      The Company carries comprehensive liability and all risk property
insurance (fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance) with
respect to its assets. The Company's all risk insurance policies in effect
before September 11, 2001 included coverage for terrorist acts, except for acts
of war. Since September 11, 2001, insurance companies are excluding terrorists
acts from coverage in all risk policies. In 2002, the Company has been unable to
obtain all risk insurance which includes coverage for terrorists acts for
policies it has renewed including the New York City Office portfolio and may not
be able to obtain such coverage for any of its other properties in the future.
Therefore, the risk of financial loss in the case of terrorist acts is the
Company's, which loss could be material.

      The Company's debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by
its properties (which are generally non-recourse to the Company) and its
revolving credit agreement, contain customary covenants requiring the Company to
maintain insurance. There can be no assurance that the lenders under these
instruments will not take the position that an exclusion from all risk insurance
coverage for losses due to terrorist acts is a breach of these debt instruments
that allows the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate repayment
of debt. In addition, if lenders insist on coverage for these risks, it could
adversely affect the Company's ability to finance and/or refinance its
properties and to expand its portfolio.

      In addition, many of the Company's non-recourse mortgages contain debt
service covenants which if not satisfied could require cash collateral. These
covenants are not "ratings" related.

CORPORATE

      On September 20, 2001, the Company sold an aggregate of $45,000,000 8.25%
Series D-9 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units resulting in net proceeds of
approximately $43,875,000.

      On November 19, 2001, the Company sold 9,775,000 common shares pursuant to
an effective registration statement based on the closing price of $40.58 on the
NYSE. The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $377,200,000. In
connection therewith the Company repaid the $285,000,000 then outstanding under
its revolving credit facility.

      On February 25, 2002, the Company sold 884,543 common shares to a
closed-end fund and 514,200 shares to a unit investment trust based on the
closing price of $42.96 on the NYSE. The net proceeds to the Company were
approximately $57,042,000.


                                      -85-


OFFICE

      On January 11, 2001, the Company completed a $105,000,000 refinancing of
its 888 Seventh Avenue office building. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate
of 6.6% and matures on January 1, 2006. A portion of the proceeds received were
used to repay the then existing mortgage of $55,000,000.

MERCHANDISE MART

      On October 16, 2001, the Company completed a $49,000,000 refinancing of
its Washington Design Center property. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate
of 6.95% and matures on October 16, 2011. A portion of the proceeds received
were used to repay the then existing mortgage of $23,000,000.

      On July 11, 2001, the Company completed a $50,000,000 refinancing of its
Market Square Complex. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.95% and
matures in July 2011. The proceeds received were used to repay the then existing
mortgage of $49,000,000.

OTHER

      On September 20, 2001, the Company completed a $50,000,000 mortgage
financing, cross-collateralized by its eight industrial warehouse properties.
The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.95% per annum and matures on
October 1, 2011.

      On February 1, 2002, the Newkirk MLP, in which the Company has a 21.1%
interest, completed a $225,000,000 mortgage financing collateralized by its
properties, subject to the existing first and certain second mortgages on those
properties. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 5.5% with a LIBOR floor of
3.0% (8.5% at February 1, 2002) and matures on January 31, 2005, with two
one-year extension options.

      The Company has an effective shelf registration under which the Company
can offer an aggregate of approximately $940,000,000 of equity securities and
Vornado Realty L.P. can offer an aggregate of $1.0 billion of debt
securities.

      The Company anticipates that cash from continuing operations will be
adequate to fund business operations and the payment of dividends and
distributions on an on-going basis for more than the next twelve months;
however, capital outlays for significant acquisitions will require funding from
borrowings or equity offerings.


                                      -86-


RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

      The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE
INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, as amended, which establishes accounting and
reporting standards requiring every derivative instrument (including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded on the balance
sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. The Statement
requires that changes in the derivative instrument's fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The
Company's investment securities include stock purchase warrants received from
companies that provide fiber-optic network and broadband access to the Company's
Office division tenants. Statement 133 requires these warrants to be
marked-to-market at each reporting period with the change in value recognized
currently in earnings. The Company has previously marked-to-market changes in
value through accumulated other comprehensive loss. Under Statement 133, those
changes are recognized through earnings, and accordingly, the Company has
reclassified $4,110,000 from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the
consolidated statement of income as the cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle as of January 1, 2001. Future changes in value of such
securities will be recorded through earnings. The Company does not currently
utilize derivatives for hedging purposes and does not engage in speculative
activities.

      In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (effective July 1, 2001) and SFAS No. 142, GOODWILL
AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (effective January 1, 2002). SFAS No. 141 prohibits
pooling-of-interests accounting for acquisitions. SFAS No. 142 specifies that
goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be amortized but instead be
subject to periodic impairment testing. In the first quarter of 2002, the
Company will write-off goodwill of approximately $32,491,000, of which (i)
$18,000,000 represents its share of the goodwill arising from the Company's
investment in Temperature Controlled Logistics and (ii) $14,491,000 represents
goodwill arising from the Company's acquisition of the Hotel Pennsylvania. The
write-off will be reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle. Amortization of goodwill during 2001 was approximately $1,116,000.

      In August 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 143, ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT
OBLIGATIONS (effective January 1, 2003) and SFAS No. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE
IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS (effective January 1, 2002). SFAS
No. 143 requires the recording of the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation in the period which it is incurred. SFAS No. 144
supersedes current accounting literature and now provides for a single
accounting model for long lived-assets to be disposed of by sale and requires
discontinued operations presentation for disposals of a "component" of an
entity. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of these statements
will have a material effect on the Company's financial statements; however under
SFAS No. 144, if the Company were to dispose of a material operating property,
such property's results of operations will have to be separately disclosed as
discontinued operations in the Company's financial statements.


                                      -87-


ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

      The Company's exposure to a change in interest rates on its wholly-owned
and partially-owned debt (all of which arises out of non-trading activity) is as
follows:



- ----------
(1)   Excludes the effect of a $123,500 mortgage financing, cross-collateralized
      by the Company's 770 Broadway and 595 Madison Avenue office properties, as
      the proceeds are in a restricted mortgage escrow account which bears
      interest at the same rate as the loan.

      Various financial instruments exist which could be employed to reduce the
Company's exposure to change in interest rates. The Company does not currently
utilize such hedging strategies.

      The fair value of the Company's debt at December 31, 2001, based on
discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made
to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt
approximates its carrying value.


                                      -88-

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Shareholders and Board of Trustees
Vornado Realty Trust
New York, New York

      We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vornado
Realty Trust as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2001. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 14. These financial
statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

      We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Vornado Realty Trust at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS

      Vornado Realty Trust is a fully-integrated real estate investment trust

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      BASIS OF PRESENTATION: The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Vornado Realty Trust and its majority-owned subsidiary,
Vornado Realty L.P. as well as entities in which the Company has a 50% or
greater interest, provided that the Company exercises control (where the Company
doesn't exercise control, such entities are accounted for under the equity
method). All significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated. Equity
interests in partially-owned corporate entities are accounted for under the
equity method of accounting when the Company's ownership interest is more than
20% but less than 50%. When partially-owned investments are in partnership form,
the 20% threshold may be reduced. For all other investments, the Company uses
the cost method. Equity investments are recorded initially at cost and
subsequently adjusted for the Company's share of the net income or loss and cash
contributions and distributions to or from these entities.

      Prior to January 1, 2001, the Company's equity interests in
partially-owned entities also included investments in preferred stock
affiliates (corporations in which the Company owned all of the preferred
stock and none of the common equity). Ownership of the preferred stock
entitled the Company to substantially all of the economic benefits in the
preferred stock affiliates. On January 1, 2001, the Company acquired the
common stock of the preferred stock affiliates, which was owned by Officers
and Trustees of Vornado, and converted them to taxable REIT subsidiaries.
Accordingly, the Hotel portion of the Hotel Pennsylvania and the management
companies (which provide services to the Company's business segments and
operate the Trade Show business of the Merchandise Mart division) have been
consolidated beginning January 1, 2001.

      Management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

      RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain prior year balances have been reclassified in
order to conform to current year presentation.

      REAL ESTATE: Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Betterments, major renewals and certain costs
directly related to the acquisition, improvement and leasing of real estate are
capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. For
redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book value of the
existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and
improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to
the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated
fair value of the redeveloped property when complete. If the cost of the
redeveloped property, including the undepreciated net book value of the property
carried forward, exceeds the estimated fair value of redeveloped property, the
excess is charged to expense. During 2001, the amount of undepreciated book
value carried forward on redeveloped properties totaled $8,116,000. Depreciation
is provided on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful lives
which range from 7 to 40 years. Tenant allowances are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximates the
useful lives of the assets. Additions to real estate include interest expense
capitalized during construction of $12,171,000, $12,269,000, and $7,012,000 for
the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999.

      The Company's properties are reviewed for impairment if events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be
recoverable. In such an event, a comparison is made of the current and projected
operating cash flows of each such property into the foreseeable future on an
undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of such property. Such carrying amount
would be adjusted, if necessary, to estimated fair value to reflect an
impairment in the value of the asset.

      CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly
liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less.
Cash and cash equivalents does not include cash escrowed under loan agreements
and cash restricted in connection with an officer's deferred compensation
payable.

      MARKETABLE SECURITIES: The Company has classified debt and equity
securities which it intends to hold for an indefinite period of time
(including warrants to acquire equity securities) as securities available for
sale; equity securities it intends to buy and sell on a short term basis as
trading securities; and preferred stock investments as securities held to
maturity. Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in
earnings. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are
included as a component of shareholders' equity and other comprehensive
income. Realized gains or losses on the sale of securities are recorded based
on specific identification. A portion of the Company's preferred stock
investments are redeemable and accounted for in accordance with EITF 99-20
"Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained
Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets." Income is recognized
by applying the prospective method of adjusting the yield to maturity based
on an estimate of future cash flows. If the value of the investment based on
the present value of the future cash flows is less than the Company's
carrying amount, the investments will be written-down to fair value through
earnings.

                              VORNADO REALTY TRUST

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)

      At December 31, 2001 and 2000, marketable securities had an aggregate cost
of $117,284,000 and $129,023,000 and an aggregate market value of $126,774,000
and $120,340,000 (of which $13,888,000 and $13,713,000 represents trading
securities; $49,763,000 and $57,945,000 represents securities available for
sale; and $63,123,000 and $48,682,000 represent securities held to maturity).
Gross unrealized gains and losses were $14,738,000 and $5,243,000 at December
31, 2001, and $8,159,000 and $16,842,000 at December 31, 2000.

      NOTES AND MORTGAGE LOANS RECEIVABLE: The Company evaluates the
collectibility of both interest and principal of each of its loans, if
circumstances warrant, to determine whether it is impaired. A loan is considered
to be impaired, when based on current information and events, it is probable
that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the
existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount
of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the
value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan's
effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient to the value of the
collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Interest on impaired loans is
recognized on a cash basis.

      DEFERRED CHARGES: Direct financing costs are deferred and amortized over
the terms of the related agreements as a component of interest expense. Direct
costs related to leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a
straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases. All other deferred
charges are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective
interest rate method, in accordance with the terms of the agreements to which
they relate.

      GOODWILL: The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets
acquired is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives which range from 10 to 40 years. Goodwill is reviewed for
impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. In such event, a comparison is made of the
current and projected operating cash flows of the related assets into the
foreseeable future on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of both the
asset and related goodwill. Such carrying amount would be adjusted, if
necessary, to estimate value to reflect an impairment in the value of the
goodwill.

      FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: All financial instruments of the
Company are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at amounts
which, in management's estimation, based upon an interpretation of available
market information and valuation methodologies (including discounted cash flow
analyses with regard to fixed rate debt) are considered appropriate, and
reasonably approximate their fair values. Such fair value estimates are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized upon disposition of
the Company's financial instruments.

      REVENUE RECOGNITION: Base rents, additional rents based on tenants'
sales volume and reimbursement of the tenants' share of certain operating
expenses are generally recognized when due from tenants. The straight-line
basis is used to recognize base rents under leases entered into after
November 14, 1985, if they provide for varying rents over the lease terms.
Contingent rents are not recognized until realized.

      INCOME TAXES: The Company operates in a manner intended to enable it to
continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at
least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year
and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of
its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. The Company will
distribute to its shareholders 100% of its taxable income before the first
distribution of the 2002 calendar year. Therefore, no provision for Federal
income taxes is required. Dividend distributions for the years ended December
31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, were characterized for Federal income tax purposes as
ordinary income.

      The Company owns stock in corporations that have elected to be treated for
Federal income tax purposes, as taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS"). The value of
the combined TRS stock cannot and does not exceed 20% of the value of the
Company's total assets. A TRS is taxable on its net income at regular corporate
tax rates. For the 2001 tax year, the total tax is approximately $1,050,000.


                                      -98-


                              VORNADO REALTY TRUST

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)

      The net basis of the Company's assets and liabilities for tax purposes is
approximately $1,069,000,000 lower than the amount reported for financial
statement purposes. At December 31, 2001, the Company had a capital loss
carryover of approximately $83,000,000. The capital loss carryover is available
to offset future capital gains that would otherwise be required to be
distributed as dividends to shareholders.

      AMOUNTS PER SHARE: Basic earnings per share is computed based on average
shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share considers the effect of
outstanding options, warrants and convertible or redeemable securities.

      STOCK OPTIONS: The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the
intrinsic value method. Under the intrinsic value method compensation cost is
measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the Company's
stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option granted.
Compensation cost for stock options, if any, is recognized ratably over the
vesting period. The Company's policy is to grant options with an exercise price
equal to the quoted market price of the Company's stock on the grant date.
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the Company's stock
option plans.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

      The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE
INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, as amended, which establishes accounting and
reporting standards requiring every derivative instrument (including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded on the balance
sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. The Statement
requires that changes in the derivative instrument's fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The
Company's investment securities include stock purchase warrants received from
companies that provide fiber-optic network and broadband access to the Company's
Office division tenants. Statement 133 requires these warrants to be
marked-to-market at each reporting period with the change in value recognized
currently in earnings. The Company has previously marked-to-market changes in
value through accumulated other comprehensive loss. Under Statement 133, those
changes are recognized through earnings, and accordingly, the Company has
reclassified $4,110,000 from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the
consolidated statement of income as the cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle as of January 1, 2001. Future changes in value of such
securities will be recorded through earnings. The Company does not currently
utilize derivatives for hedging purposes and does not engage in speculative
activities.

      In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (effective July 1, 2001) and SFAS No. 142, GOODWILL
AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (effective January 1, 2002). SFAS No. 141 prohibits
pooling-of-interests accounting for acquisitions. SFAS No. 142 specifies that
goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be amortized but instead be
subject to periodic impairment testing. In the first quarter of 2002, the
Company will write-off goodwill of approximately $32,491,000, of which (i)
$18,000,000 represents its share of the goodwill arising from the Company's
investment in Temperature Controlled Logistics and (ii) $14,491,000 represents
goodwill arising from the Company's acquisition of the Hotel Pennsylvania. The
write-off will be reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle. Amortization of goodwill during 2001 was approximately $1,116,000.

      In August 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 143, ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT
OBLIGATIONS (effective January 1, 2003) and SFAS No. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE
IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS (effective January 1, 2002). SFAS
No. 143 requires the recording of the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation in the period which it is incurred. SFAS No. 144
supersedes current accounting literature and now provides for a single
accounting model for long lived-assets to be disposed of by sale and requires
discontinued operations presentation for disposals of a "component" of an
entity. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of these statements
will have a material effect on the Company's financial statements; however under
SFAS No. 144, if the Company were to dispose of a material operating property,
such property's results of operations will have to be separately disclosed as
discontinued operations in the Company's financial statements.

      LOAN TO PRIMESTONE INVESTMENT PARTNERS, L.P.

      On September 28, 2000, the Company made a $62,000,000 loan to
Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. The Company received a 1% upfront fee

upon repayment of the loan. The loan bears interest at 16% per annum.
Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. defaulted on the repayment of this loan
on October 25, 2001. The Company's loan was subordinate to $37,957,000 of
other debt of the borrower. On October 31, 2001, the Company purchased the
other debt for its face amount. The loans are secured by 7,944,893
partnership units in Prime Group Realty, L.P., the operating partnership of
Prime Group Realty Trust (NYSE:PGE), which units are exchangeable for the
same number of shares of PGE. The loans are also guaranteed by affiliates of
the borrower. The Company has commenced foreclosure proceedings with respect
to the collateral.

      On November 19, 2001 the Company sold, pursuant to a participation
agreement with a subsidiary of Cadim inc., a Canadian pension fund, a 50%
participation in both loans at par for approximately $50,000,000 reducing the
Company's net investment in the loans at December 31, 2001 to $56,768,000
including unpaid interest and fees of $6,790,000. Under the terms of the
participation agreement, cash payments received shall be applied (i) first,
to the reimbursement of reimbursable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the servicing, administration or enforcement of
the loans after November 19, 2001, (ii) second, to the Company and Cadim pro
rata in proportion to the amount of interest and fees owed to them (all of
such fees and interest accrued through November 19, 2001 are for the account
of Vornado and all of such fees and interest accrued after November 19, 2001
accrue on a 50/50 basis to the Company and Cadim) and (iii) third, 50% to the
Company and 50% to Cadim. The Company has agreed that in the event the
Company acquires the collateral in a foreclosure proceeding it will, upon the
request of Cadim, deliver 50% of such collateral to Cadim.

      For financial reporting purposes, the gross amount of the loan,
$106,768, is included in "Notes and mortgage loans receivable" and Cadim's
50% participation, $50,000,000 is reflected in "Other liabilities". The
Company did not recognize income on these loans for the period from November
19, 2001 through December 31, 2001, and will not recognize income until such
time that cash is received or foreclosure proceedings have been consummated.
The Company believes that the value of the collateral and the guarantees is
sufficient to cover the carrying amount of the loans receivable including
unpaid interest and fees.

      LOAN TO DEARBORN CENTER

      The Company's investment of $21,522,000 represents a 38.5% interest in
$55,901,000 funded of a $65,000,000 mezzanine loan to an entity whose sole
asset is Dearborn Center, a 1.5 million square foot high-rise office tower
under construction in Chicago. The entity is owned by Prime Group Realty L.P.
and another investor. The Company is a member of a loan syndicate led by a
money center bank. The proceeds of the loan are being used to finance the
construction, and are subordinate to a $225,000 first mortgage. The loan is
due January 21, 2004, three years from the date of the initial draw, and
provides for a one year extension at the borrower's option (assuming net
operating income at a specified level and a cash reserve sufficient to fund
interest for the extension period). The loan bears interest at 12% per annum
plus additional interest ranging from a minimum of 9.5% to a maximum of 13%
if certain leasing thresholds are not met.

DISPOSITIONS:

      The following table sets forth the details of net gain on disposition of
wholly-owned and partially-owned assets for the years ended December 31, 2001,
2000 and 1999:



      NET GAIN FROM CONDEMNATION PROCEEDING

      In September 1998, Atlantic City condemned the Company's property. In the
third quarter of 1998, the Company recorded a gain of $1,694,000, which
reflected the condemnation award of $3,100,000, net of the carrying value of the
property of $1,406,000. The Company appealed the amount and on June 27, 2001,
was awarded an additional $3,050,000, which has been recorded as a gain in the
quarter ended June 30, 2001.

      WRITE-OFF INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES

      In the first quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $4,723,000
resulting from the write-off of an equity investment in a technology company. In
the second quarter of 2001, the Company recorded an additional charge of
$13,561,000 resulting from the write-off of all of its remaining equity
investments in technology companies due to both the deterioration of the
financial condition of these companies and the lack of acceptance by the market
of certain of their products and services. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the
Company recorded $1,481,000 of income resulting from the reversal of a deferred
rent liability relating to the termination of an agreement permitting one of the
technology companies access to its properties.

      550/600 MAMARONECK AVENUE

      On August 6, 2001, the Company sold its leasehold interest in 550/600

Texas for $25,750,000, resulting in a gain of $2,560,000 and (ii) its Westport,
Connecticut office property for $24,000,000, resulting in a gain of $8,405,000.

OWNERSHIP

      At December 31, 2001, the Company had a 33.1% ownership interest in
Alexander's. In addition, Interstate Properties and its partners owned
approximately 15.5% of the common shares of beneficial interest of the Company
and 27.5% of Alexander's common stock. Interstate Properties is a general
partnership in which Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are
partners. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of
the Company, the Managing General Partner of Interstate Properties, and the
Chief Executive Officer and a director of Alexander's. Messrs. Mandelbaum and
Wight are trustees of the Company and are also directors of Alexander's.

      At December 31, 2001, the Company had loans receivable from Alexander's of
$119,000,000, including $24,000,000 drawn under the $50,000,000 line of credit
the Company granted to Alexander's on August 1, 2000. The interest rates on the
loan and the line of credit were extended to April 15, 2003. The interest rates
on the loan and line of credit will reset on March 15, 2002, and quarterly
thereafter, using the same spread to treasuries as presently exists with a 3%
floor for treasuries.

REAL ESTATE AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY

      Alexander's has completed the excavation and foundation for its Lexington
Avenue property development project. The development plan is to construct a 1.4
million square foot multi-use building comprised of a commercial portion, which
may include a combination of retail stores and offices; and a residential
portion consisting of condominium units. There can be no assurance that the
residential portion will be built. The funding required for the proposed
building will be in excess of $650,000,000. Alexander's is exploring various
alternatives for financing the project, including equity, debt, joint ventures
and asset sales, which may involve arrangements with the Company.

      On May 1, 2001 Alexander's entered into a lease agreement with Bloomberg
L.P., for approximately 700,000 square feet of office space. The initial term of
the lease is for 25 years, with one ten-year renewal option. Base annual net
rent is $34,221,000 in each of the first four years and $38,226,000 in the fifth
year with similar percentage increases each four years. There can be no
assurance that this project ultimately will be completed, completed on time or
completed for the budgeted amount. If the project is not completed on a timely
basis, the lease may be cancelled and significant penalties may apply.

      On January 12, 2001, Alexander's sold its Fordham Road property located in
Bronx, New York for $25,500,000, which resulted in a gain of $19,026,000. In
addition, Alexander's paid off the mortgage on this property at a discount,
which resulted in an extraordinary gain from early extinguishment of debt of
$3,534,000 in the first quarter of 2001.

      On October 5, 2001, Alexander's entered into a ground lease for its
Paramus, N.J. property with IKEA Property, Inc. The lease has a 40-year term
with an option to purchase at the end of the 20th year for $75,000,000. Further,
Alexander's has obtained a $68,000,000 interest only, non-recourse mortgage loan
on the property from a third party lender. The interest rate on the debt is
5.92% with interest payable monthly until maturity in October, 2011. The triple
net rent each year is the sum of $700,000 plus the amount of debt service on the
mortgage loan. If the purchase option is not exercised at the end of the 20th
year, the triple net rent for the last 20 years must include debt service
sufficient to fully amortize the $68,000,000 over the remaining 20 year lease
period.

AGREEMENTS WITH ALEXANDER'S

      Alexander's is managed by and its properties are leased by the Company,
pursuant to agreements with a one-year term expiring in March of each year which
are automatically renewable. The annual management fee payable to the Company by
Alexander's is equal to the sum of (i) $3,000,000, (ii) 3% of the gross income
from the Kings Plaza Mall, and (iii) 6% of development costs with minimum
guaranteed fees of $750,000 per annum.

      The leasing agreement provides for the Company to generally receive a fee
of (i) 3% of sales proceeds and (ii) 3% of lease rent for the first ten years of
a lease term, 2% of lease rent for the eleventh through the twentieth years of a
lease term and 1% of lease rent for the twenty-first through thirtieth year of a
lease term, subject to the payment of rents by Alexander's tenants. Such amount
is receivable annually in an amount not to exceed $2,500,000 until the present
value of such installments (calculated at a discount rate of 9% per annum)
equals the amount that would have been paid at the time the transactions which
gave rise to the commissions occurred. At December 31, 2001, $2,249,000 is due
to the Company under this agreement.

      building for $90,000. Of the proceeds received, the Company repaid the
      existing debt of $65,000. The new 3-year debt matures on February 28, 2003
      and bears interest at Libor + 1.45% (3.38% at December 31, 2001).

(7)   On August 11, 2000, the Company completed a $173,500 mortgage financing,
      cross-collaterized by its 770 Broadway and 595 Madison Avenue office
      buildings. The loan bears interest at LIBOR + .40% (2.27% at December 31,
      2001) and matures on August 1, 2002. At December 31, 2001, the proceeds of
      the loan are in a restricted mortgage escrow account, which bears interest

      The Company's debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by
its properties (which generally non-recourse to the Company and its revolving
credit agreement, contain customary covenants requiring the Company to maintain
insurance. There can be no assurance that the lenders under these instruments
will not take the position that an exclusion from all risk insurance coverage
for losses due to terrorist acts is a breach of these debt instruments that
allows the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate repayment of
debt. In addition, if lenders insist on coverage for these risks, it could
adversely affect the Company's ability to finance and/or refinance its
properties and to expand its portfolio.

7. EMPLOYEES' SHARE OPTION PLAN

      Under the Omnibus Share Plan (the "Plan"), various officers and employees
have been granted incentive share options and non-qualified options to purchase
common shares. Options granted are at prices equal to 100% of the market price
of the Company's shares at the date of grant. Shares vest on a graduated basis,
becoming fully vested 36 months after grant. All options expire ten years after
grant.

      The Plan also provides for the award of Stock Appreciation Rights,
Performance Shares and Restricted Stock, as defined, none of which have been
awarded as of December 31, 2001.

      If compensation cost for Plan awards had been determined based on fair

9. LEASES

      AS LESSOR:

      The Company leases space to tenants in office buildings and shopping
centers under operating leases. Most of the leases provide for the payment of
fixed base rentals payable monthly in advance. Shopping center leases provide
for the pass-through to tenants of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance.
Office building leases generally require the tenants to reimburse the Company
for operating costs and real estate taxes above their base year costs. Shopping
center leases also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rent
based on a percentage of the tenants' sales. As of December 31, 2001, future
base rental revenue under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding rents for
leases with an original term of less than one year and rents resulting from the
exercise of renewal options, is as follows:



      These amounts do not include rentals based on tenants' sales. These
percentage rents approximated $2,157,000, $4,825,000, and $2,213,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999.

      In February 2001, Bradlees, which was in Chapter 11, closed all of its
stores including the 16 locations it leased from the Company. Three of the
former Bradlees leases were assigned and 13 were rejected. Of the 16 locations,
the leases for 13 are fully guaranteed (6 of these guarantees expire in 2002)
and one is guaranteed as to 70% by Stop & Shop Companies, Inc., under a Master
Agreement and Guaranty dated May 1, 1992. Stop & Shop is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of KoninKlijke Ahold NV (formerly Royal Ahold NV), a leading
international food retailer. In addition to these 14 leases, Stop & Shop also
guarantees four other leases which were rejected in a prior Bradlees bankruptcy
(three of which have been assigned). The effectiveness of Stop & Shop's
guarantee is not affected by Bradlees' bankruptcy or subsequent lease
assignments. Annual property rentals at December 31, 2001, include an aggregate
of $4,000,000 of additional rent allocated to the former Bradlees locations in
East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge in accordance with
the Master Agreement and Guaranty. This rent will be reallocated to other
locations guaranteed by Stop & Shop at or prior to the applicable expiration
dates of such leases.

      None of the Company's tenants represented more than 10% of the Company's
total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001.

      AS LESSEE:

      The Company is a tenant under operating leases for certain properties.
These leases will expire principally during the next thirty years. Future
minimum lease payments under operating leases at December 31, 2001, are as
follows:



      Rent expense was $15,433,000, $15,248,000, and $14,269,000 for the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999.

balance, and utilized $93,600,000 of availability under the facility for letters
of credit and guarantees.

      Each of the Company's properties has been subjected to varying degrees of
environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not
reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no
assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the
extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or
changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to the
Company.

      The Company carries comprehensive liability and all risk property
insurance (fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance) with
respect to its assets. The Company's all risk insurance policies in effect
before September 11, 2001 included coverage for terrorist acts, except for acts
of war. Since September 11, 2001, insurance companies are excluding terrorists
acts from coverage in all risk policies. In 2002, the Company has been unable to
obtain all risk insurance which includes coverage for terrorists acts for
policies it has renewed including the New York City Office portfolio and may not
be able to obtain such coverage for any of its other properties in the future.
Therefore, the risk of financial loss in the case of terrorist acts is the
Company's, which loss could be material.

      The Company's debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by
its properties (which are generally non-recourse to the Company) and its
revolving credit agreement, contain customary covenants requiring the Company to
maintain insurance. There can be no assurance that the lenders under these
instruments will not take the position that an exclusion from all risk insurance
coverage for losses due to terrorist acts is a breach of these debt instruments
that allows the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate repayment
of debt. In addition, if lenders insist on coverage for these risks, it could
adversely affect the Company's ability to finance and/or refinance its
properties and to expand its portfolio.

      From time-to-time, the Company has disposed of substantial amounts of real
estate to third parties for which, as to certain properties, it remains
contingently liable for rent payments or mortgage indebtedness.

                                     -115-


      On October 25, 2001, Primestone Investment Partners L.P. ("Primestone")
defaulted on the repayment of its loan from the Company (See Note 3 -
Acquisitions and Dispositions). On November 19, 2001, the Company commenced
an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Primestone Investment
Partners, L.P. in connection with foreclosure proceedings with respect to the
collateral under the loan agreement.

      Although Primestone is a special purpose entity with only one asset,
units in Prime Group Realty, L.P., no operations, no employees and no
operating income, it filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on November 19,
2001 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The
Company moved to dismiss Primestone's petition as bad faith filing. A federal
bankruptcy judge granted the Company's motion on December 18, 2001.

      Following the bankruptcy court's dismissal of Primestone's petition,
the Company attempted to reschedule the auction for January 25, 2002.
Primestone appealed to the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware, and the auction was stayed pending appeal. On January 28, 2002, the
district court affirmed the bankruptcy court's decision. The Company has
since attempted to reschedule the auction for a third time, but Primestone
has appealed once again, this time to the United States Court of Appeals.
Briefing for the appeal concluded on February 25, 2002 and the parties are
currently awaiting a decision as to if and when oral argument will occur.

      On February 13, 2002, Primestone counterclaimed against the Company. In
the counterclaim, Primestone alleges that the Company tortiously interfered
with a prospective contract with Cadim, inc. Primestone alleges that the
failure to consummate this alleged contract deprived it of the ability to
repay its loans to the Company, and that the Company is attempting to obtain
control of Prime Group Realty Trust, a publicly held affiliate of Primestone,
at an artificially low price. Primestone seeks equitable relief, including a
permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from foreclosing on collateral
pledged by Primestone, and also demands damages totaling $150,000,000 plus
costs and attorneys' fees. The parties commenced discovery on an expedited
basis in preparation for a hearing on Primestone's motion for a preliminary
injunction that was scheduled for February 22, 2002, but Primestone has
indicated that it intends not to proceed with that motion in light of a stay
granted by the United States Court of Appeals in Primestone's appeal from the
dismissal of its bankruptcy case. Vornado plans to file a reply denying the
essential allegations of the counterclaim.

      There are various legal actions against the Company in the ordinary course
of business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal
counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on the
Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

11. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

      The Company enters into agreements for the purchase and resale of U.S.
government obligations for periods of up to one week. The obligations purchased
under these agreements are held in safekeeping in the name of the Company by
various money center banks. The Company has the right to demand additional
collateral or return of these invested funds at any time the collateral value is
less than 102% of the invested funds plus any accrued earnings thereon.

12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

      LOAN AND COMPENSATION AGREEMENTS

      At December 31, 2001, the loan due from Mr. Roth in accordance with his
employment arrangement was $13,123,000 ($4,704,000 of which is shown as a
reduction in shareholders' equity). The loan bears interest at 4.49% per annum
(based on the applicable Federal rate) and matures in January 2006. The Company
also provided Mr. Roth with the right to draw up to $15,000,000 of additional
loans on a revolving basis. Each additional loan will bear interest, payable
quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the loan is made and will
mature on the sixth anniversary of the loan.

      At December 31, 2001, loans due from Mr. Fascitelli, in accordance with
his employment agreement, aggregated $8,600,000. The loans which were
scheduled to mature in 2003 have been extended to 2006 in connection with the
extension of Mr. Fascitelli's employment agreement (discussed below), and
bear interest, payable quarterly at a weighted average interest rate of 3.97%
(based on the applicable Federal rate).

      Pursuant to his December 1996 employment agreement in December 1996,
Mr. Fascitelli became entitled to a deferred payment consisting of $5,000,000
in cash and a convertible obligation payable November 30, 2001, at the
Company's option in 919,540 of its common shares or the cash equivalent of
their appreciated value but not less than $20,000,000. Prior to November 30,
2001, the Company and Mr. Fascitelli have agreed to extend the deferral
period for three additional years. The Company has funded the obligation in
common shares. Accordingly, the Company has reflected this liability as a
deferred compensation shares not yet delivered in the Equity section of the
balance sheet. The cash and common shares are held in an irrevocable trust
(the fair value of this obligation was $40,155,000 at December 31, 2001). For
the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized
approximately $4,744,000 and $3,733,000 of compensation expense of which
$2,612,000 and $1,968,000 represented the appreciation in value of the shares
in each period and $2,132,000 and $1,765,000 represented dividends paid on
the shares.

      On March 8, 2002, the Company extended its employment agreement with
Mr. Fascitelli for a five year period ending December 31, 2006. Pursuant to
the employment agreement, he will receive a deferred payment in five years of
626,566 Vornado common shares which are valued for compensation purposes at
$27,500,000. The number of shares was set by the Company's Compensation
Committee in December to achieve a value of $25,000,000 and have appreciated
$2,500,000 since then. The shares will vest on December 31, 2002. Mr.
Fascitelli will also receive regular annual cash compensation as determined
by the Company's Compensation Committee and will continue as a member of
Vornado's Board.

      One other executive officer of the Company a loan outstanding pursuant
to an employment agreement of $1,000,000 at December 31, 2001. The loan matures
in April 2005 and bears interest at either the applicable Federal rate provided
or the broker call rate (6.63% at December 31, 2001).

      Information regarding employment agreements with other Officers of the
Company are incorporated by reference in Part II of this document.

real estate companies, that the terms and conditions of such contracts are
fair to the Company. In connection with these contracts, the Company paid
$51,280,000, $47,493,000, and $40,974,000 for the years ended December 31,

VORNADO OPERATING COMPANY

      In October 1998, Vornado Operating Company ("Vornado Operating") was spun
off from the Company in order to own assets that the Company could not itself
own and conduct activities that the Company could not itself conduct. The
Company granted Vornado Operating a $75,000,000 unsecured revolving credit
facility (the "Revolving Credit Agreement") which expires on December 31, 2004.
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus 3%.
The Company receives a commitment fee equal to 1% per annum on the average daily
unused portion of the facility. No amortization is required to be paid under the
Revolving Credit Agreement during its term. The Revolving Credit Agreement
prohibits Vornado Operating from incurring indebtedness to third parties (other
than certain purchase money debt and certain other exceptions) and prohibits
Vornado Operating from paying dividends. As of December 31, 2001, $31,424,000
was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement.

OTHER

      The Company owns preferred securities in Capital Trust, Inc. ("Capital
Trust") totaling $48,758,000 at December 31, 2001. Mr. Roth, the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of Vornado Realty Trust, is a member of the Board of
Directors of Capital Trust nominated by the Company.

      On May 17, 2001, the Company sold its 50% interest in 570 Lexington
Avenue to an entity controlled by the late Bernard Mendik, a former executive
officer of the Company, for $60,000,000, resulting in a gain to the Company
of $12,445,000.

      During 2001, the Company paid $136,000 for legal services to a firm in
which one of the Company's trustees is a member.

      On January 1, 2001, the Company acquired the common stock of various
preferred stock affiliates which was owned by Officer and Trustees of the
Company and converted them to taxable REIT subsidiaries. The total acquisition
price was $5,155,000. The purchase price, which was the estimated fair value,
was determined by both independent appraisal and by reference to the
individuals' pro rata share of the earnings of the preferred stock affiliates
during the three-year period that these investments were held.

      In connection with the Park Laurel condominium project, the joint venture
accrued $5,779,000 of awards under the venture's incentive compensation plan.

*     These encumbrances are cross collateralized under a blanket mortgage in
      the amount of $492,213 at December 31, 2001.

Notes:

      (1)   Initial cost is cost as of January 30, 1982 (the date on which
            Vornado commenced real estate operations) unless acquired subsequent
            to that date -- see Column H.
      (2)   The net basis of the company's assets and liabilities for tax
            purposes is approximately $1,069,000 lower than the amount reported
            for financial statement purposes.
      (3)   Date of original construction -- many properties have had
            substantial renovation or additional construction -- see Column D.
      (4)   Buildings on these properties were demolished. As a result, the cost
            of the buildings and improvements, net of accumulated depreciation,
            were transferred to land. In addition, the cost of the land in
            Kearny is net of a $1,615 insurance recovery.
