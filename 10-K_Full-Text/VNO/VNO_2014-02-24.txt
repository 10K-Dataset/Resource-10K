PART I

ITEM 1.        BUSINESS

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”).  Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors.  Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 94.0% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2013.  All references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership.

As of December 31, 2013, we own all or portions of:

New York:

·

19.8 million square feet of Manhattan office space in 31 properties and four residential properties containing 1,653 units;

·

2.4 million square feet of Manhattan street retail space in 55 properties;

·

The 1,700 room Hotel Pennsylvania located on Seventh Avenue at 33

rd

Street in the heart of the Penn Plaza district;

·

A 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX), which owns six properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, including 731 Lexington Avenue, the 1.3 million square foot Bloomberg, L.P. headquarters building;

Washington, DC:

·

16.2 million square feet of office space in 59 properties and seven residential properties containing 2,405 units;

Retail Properties:

·

14.9 million square feet of retail space in 106 strip shopping centers and single tenant retail assets, primarily in the northeast states and California;

·

5.3 million square feet of retail space in six regional malls, located in the northeast / mid-Atlantic states and Puerto Rico;

Other Real Estate and Related Investments:

·

The 3.6 million square foot Merchandise Mart in Chicago, whose largest tenant is Motorola Mobility, owned by Google, which leases 608,000 square feet;

·

A 70% controlling interest in 555 California Street, a three-building office complex in San Francisco’s financial district aggregating 1.8 million square feet, known as the Bank of America Center;

·

A 25.0% interest in Vornado Capital Partners, our real estate fund.  We are the general partner and investment manager of the fund;

·

A 32.6% interest in Toys “R” Us, Inc.; and

·

Other real estate and related investments and mortgage and mezzanine loans on real estate.


Objectives and Strategy

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and execute our operating strategies through:

·

Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

·

Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;

·

Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

·

Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;

·

Developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and

·

Investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets.  We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

ACQUISITIONS

Since January 1, 2013, we have completed the following acquisitions:

·

A 20.1% interest in 650 Madison Avenue, a 27-story, 594,000 square foot Class A office and retail tower located on Madison Avenue between 59th and 60th Street, for $260 million ($1.295 billion at 100%).

·

A 92.5% interest in 655 Fifth Avenue, a 57,500 square foot retail and office property located at the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street in Manhattan, for $277.5 million ($300 million at 100%).

SEGMENT DATA

We operate in the following business segments: New York, Washington, DC, Retail Properties, and Toys “R” Us (“Toys”).  As a result of certain organizational changes and asset sales in 2012, the Merchandise Mart segment no longer meets the criteria to be a separate reportable segment; accordingly, effective January 1, 2013, the remaining assets have been reclassified to “Other.”  We have also reclassified the prior period segment financial results to conform to the current year presentation. Financial information related to these business segments for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 is set forth in Note 26 – Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

SEASONALITY

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the current quarter to the previous quarter. The business of Toys is highly seasonal and substantially all of Toys’ net income is generated in its fourth quarter, which we record on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter. The New York and Washington, DC segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year.  The Retail Properties segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage and specialty rental income.

tenants ACCOUNTING FOR over 10% of revenues

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011

.


Certain Activities

We do not base our acquisitions and investments on specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for long‑term investment; however, it is possible that properties in our portfolio may be sold when circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property or property type. While we may seek the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by our Board of Trustees without the vote of shareholders.

Employees

As of December 31, 2013, we have approximately 4,369 employees, of which 339 are corporate staff. The New York segment has 3,244 employees, including 2,564 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering services primarily to our New York and Washington, DC properties and 516 employees at the Hotel Pennsylvania. The Washington, DC and Retail Properties segments have 448 and 107 employees, respectively and the Merchandise Mart properties have 231 employees.  The foregoing does not include employees of partially owned entities, including Toys or Alexander’s, of which we own 32.6% and 32.4%, respectively.

principal executive offices

Our principal executive offices are located at 888 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019; telephone (212) 894‑7000.

ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS

Material factors that may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition are summarized below.  The risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.  See “Forward-Looking Statements” contained herein on page 3.

Real Estate Investments’ Value and Income Fluctuate Due to Various Factors.

The value of real estate fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business. These conditions may also adversely impact our revenues and cash flows.

The factors that affect the value of our real estate investments include, among other things:

·

national, regional and local economic conditions;

·

competition from other available space;

·

local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area;

·

how well we manage our properties;

·

the development and/or redevelopment of our properties;

·

changes in market rental rates;

·

the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;

·

whether we are able to pass all or portions of any increases in operating costs through to tenants;

·

changes in real estate taxes and other expenses;

·

whether tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property attractive;

·

the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;

·

availability of financing on acceptable terms or at all;

·

inflation or deflation;

·

fluctuations in interest rates;

·

our ability to obtain adequate insurance;

·

changes in zoning laws and taxation;

·

government regulation;

·

consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attacks against, the United States;

·

potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations;

·

natural disasters;

·

general competitive factors; and

·

climate changes.

The rents or sales proceeds we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors. If rental revenues, sales proceeds and/or occupancy levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available to pay indebtedness and for distribution to shareholders. In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs generally do not decline when the related rents decline.

Capital markets and economic conditions can materially affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations as well as the value of our debt and equity securities.

There are many factors that can affect the value of our debt and equity securities, including the state of the capital markets and the economy.  Demand for office and retail space may decline nationwide, as it did in 2008 and 2009 due to the economic downturn, bankruptcies, downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting.  Government action or inaction may adversely affect the state of the capital markets.  The cost and availability of credit may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads, which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our results of operations, and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants.  Our inability or the inability of our tenants to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the value of our debt and equity securities.


Real
estate is a competitive business.

We compete with a large number of property owners
and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their
investments. Principal factors of competition include rents charged, sales
prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth
and quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other
factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies, financial
condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and
customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs,
taxes, governmental regulation, legislation and population trends.

We depend on leasing space
to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from tenants who
may not be able to pay.

Our financial results depend significantly on
leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms. In
addition, because a majority of our income comes from renting of real property,
our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and funds available for
distribution to shareholders will decrease if a significant number of our
tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain occupancy
levels on favorable terms. If a tenant does not pay its rent, we may not be
able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial
legal costs.  During periods of economic adversity, there may be an increase in
the number of tenants that cannot pay their rent and an increase in vacancy
rates.

Bankruptcy or insolvency of
tenants may decrease our revenue, net income and available cash.

From time to time, some of our tenants have
declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become
insolvent in the future. In the case of our malls and strip shopping centers,
the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could cause us to suffer lower
revenues and operational difficulties, including leasing the remainder of the
property. As a result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could
result in decreased revenue, net income and funds available to pay our
indebtedness or make distributions to shareholders.

We may
incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and environmental
contamination may impair our ability to lease and/or sell real estate.

Our operations and properties are subject to
various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection
of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic
substances and health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or
previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and
clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or
operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties
for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up
costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination. These laws often
impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the
release of the substances or caused the release. The presence of contamination
or the failure to remediate contamination may impair our ability to sell or
lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other laws
and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can
require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event
of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of
and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. The maintenance and removal of lead
paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) are also regulated by federal and state laws. We are also subject to
risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants
such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can
be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in
susceptible individuals. Our predecessor companies may be subject to similar
liabilities for activities of those companies in the past.  We could incur
fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial
action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or related claims
arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure to contamination
at or from our properties.

Each of our properties has been subject to varying
degrees of environmental assessment. To date, these environmental assessments
have not revealed any environmental condition material to our business.
However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of
contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination,  human
exposure to contamination or changes in clean-up or compliance requirements
could result in significant costs to us.

We face risks associated with our tenants
being designated “Prohibited Persons” by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.

Pursuant to Executive Order 13224
and other laws, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States
Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”) maintains a list of persons designated as
terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned (“Prohibited Persons”) from
conducting business or engaging in transactions in the United States.  Our
leases, loans and other agreements may require us to comply with OFAC
requirements.  If a tenant or other party with whom we conduct business is
placed on the OFAC list we may be required to terminate the lease or other
agreement.  Any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or otherwise
negatively affect our financial results and cash flows.


Our business and
operations would suffer in the event of system failures.

Despite system redundancy, the implementation of
security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal
information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any
number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy
blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures. 
Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations
could result in a material disruption to our business.  We may also incur
additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions.

The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a
deficiency in our cyber security, could negatively impact our business by
causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our
confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships, all of
which could negatively impact our financial results.

A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse
event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our
information resources. More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional
attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access
to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or steal confidential
information. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks
posed to our systems, both internal and those we have outsourced. Our three
primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber
incident include operational interruption, damage to our relationship with our
tenants, and private data exposure.  We have implemented processes, procedures
and controls to help mitigate these risks, but these measures, as well as our
increased awareness

of
a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that our financial results will
not be negatively impacted by such an incident.

Some of our potential
losses may not be covered by insurance.

We maintain
general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all
risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per
occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods.  Our California
properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $180,000,000 per
occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the
affected property, up to a $180,000,000 annual aggregate. We maintain coverage
for terrorism acts with limits of $4.0 billion per occurrence and in the
aggregate, and $2.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism
involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) terrorism
events, as defined by Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act,
which expires in December 2014.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our
wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a
portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our
earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for NBCR
acts.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured
by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure
to PPIC.  For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and
15% of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible
for the remaining 85% of a covered loss.  We are ultimately responsible for any
loss incurred by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance
market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we
cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable
terms in the future.

Our debt
instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are
non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements
contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we
believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these
agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at
reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage
than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our
properties and expand our portfolio.

Compliance
or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety
regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”)
generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, meet
certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. 
Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government
or the award of damages to private litigants and/or legal fees to their
counsel.  From time to time persons have asserted claims against us with
respect to some of our properties under the ADA, but to date such claims have
not resulted in any material expense or liability.  If, under the ADA, we are
required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or
more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as
the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders.


Our properties are subject to various federal,
state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life
safety requirements.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could
incur fines or private damage awards.  We do not know whether existing
requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will
require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow
and results of operations.

Our Investments Are
Concentrated in the New York CITY METROPOLITAN AREA and Washington, DC /
NORTHERN VIRGINIA Area. Circumstances Affecting These Areas Generally Could
Adversely Affect Our Business.

A
significant portion of our properties are located in the New York City / New
Jersey metropolitan area and Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area and are
affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent to those areas.

In 2013, approximately 96% of our EBITDA,
excluding items that affect comparability, came from properties located in the
New York City metropolitan areas and the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia
area.  We may continue to concentrate a significant portion of our future
acquisitions in these areas or in other geographic real estate markets in the United
States or abroad.  Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns and we
cannot predict how economic conditions will impact these markets in either the
short or long term. Declines in the economy or declines in real estate markets
in these areas could hurt our financial performance and the value of our
properties.  In addition to the factors affecting the national economic
condition generally, the factors affecting economic conditions in these regions
include:

·

financial
performance and productivity of the media, advertising, financial, technology,
retail, insurance and real estate industries;

·

space
needs of, and budgetary constraints affecting, the United States Government,
including the effect of a deficit reduction plan and/or base closures and
repositioning under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 2005, as
amended;

·

business
layoffs or downsizing;

·

industry
slowdowns;

·

relocations
of businesses;

·

changing
demographics;

·

increased
telecommuting and use of alternative work places;

·

infrastructure
quality; and

·

any
oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.

It is impossible for us to assess the future
effects of trends in the economic and investment climates of the geographic
areas in which we concentrate, and more generally of the United States, or the
real estate markets in these areas.  Local, national or global economic
downturns, would negatively affect our businesses and profitability.

Terrorist
attacks, such as those of September 11, 2001 in New York City and the Washington,   DC area, may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to
generate cash flow.

We have significant investments in large
metropolitan areas, including the New York, Washington, DC and San Francisco metropolitan areas. In the aftermath of a terrorist attack, tenants in these
areas may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile
areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of
future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize
businesses in these areas. This, in turn, would trigger a decrease in the
demand for space in these areas, which could increase vacancies in our
properties and force us to lease space on less favorable terms. As a result,
the value of our properties and the level of our revenues and cash flows could
decline materially.

Natural
Disasters could have a concentrated impact on the areas where we operate and
could adversely impact our results.

Our investments are concentrated in the New York,
Washington, DC, Chicago and San Francisco metropolitan areas.  Natural
disasters, including earthquakes, storms and hurricanes, could impact our
properties in these and other areas in which we operate.  Potentially adverse
consequences of “global warming” could similarly have an impact on our
properties.  As a result, we could become subject to significant losses and/or
repair costs that may or may not be fully covered by insurance and to the risk
of business interruption.  The incurrence of these losses, costs or business
interruptions may adversely affect our operating and financial results.


We May Acquire or Sell Assets or Entities or Develop
Properties. Our Failure or Inability to Consummate These Transactions or Manage
the Results of These Transactions Could Adversely Affect Our Operations and
Financial Results.

We may
acquire, develop or redevelop real estate and acquire related companies and
this may create risks.

We may acquire, develop or redevelop properties or
acquire real estate related companies when we believe doing so is consistent
with our business strategy. We may not succeed in (i) developing, redeveloping
or acquiring real estate and real estate related companies; (ii) completing
these activities on time or within budget; and (iii) leasing or selling
developed, redeveloped or acquired properties at amounts sufficient to cover
our costs.  Competition in these activities could also significantly increase
our costs. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming
and could divert management’s attention. Acquisitions or developments in new
markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge
may result in weaker than anticipated performance. We may also abandon
acquisition or development opportunities that we have begun pursuing and
consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred.  Furthermore, we may be
exposed to the liabilities of properties or companies acquired, some of which
we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition.

From time to time we have
made, and in the future we may seek to make, one or more material
acquisitions.  The announcement of such a material acquisition may result in a
rapid and significant decline in the price of our common shares.

We are continuously looking at material
transactions that we believe will maximize shareholder value.  However, an
announcement by us of one or more significant acquisitions could result in a
quick and significant decline in the price of our common shares.

It may be difficult to buy
and sell real estate quickly, which may limit our flexibility.

Real estate investments are relatively difficult
to buy and sell quickly. Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary our
portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.

We may
not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the debt
associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so
without incurring additional costs.  In addition, when we dispose of or sell
assets, we may not be able to reinvest the sales proceeds and earn similar
returns.

As part of an acquisition of a property, or a
portfolio of properties, we may agree, and in the past have agreed, not to
dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness for a
long-term period, unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the
seller. These agreements could result in us holding on to properties that we
would otherwise sell and not pay down or refinance.  In addition, when we
dispose of or sell assets, we may not be able to reinvest the sales proceeds
and earn returns similar to those generated by the assets that were sold.

From
time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, investments
in companies over which we do not have sole control. Some of these companies
operate in industries with different risks than investing and operating real
estate.

From time to time we have made, and in the future
we may seek to make, investments in companies that we may not control,
including, but not limited to, Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”),
Toys “R” Us (“Toys”), Lexington Realty Trust (“Lexington”), and other equity
and mezzanine investments. Although these businesses generally have a
significant real estate component, some of them operate in businesses that are
different from investing and operating real estate, including operating or
managing toy stores. Consequently, we are subject to operating and financial
risks of those industries and to the risks associated with lack of control,
such as having differing objectives than our partners or the entities in which
we invest, or becoming involved in disputes, or competing directly or
indirectly with these partners or entities.  In addition, we rely on the
internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their
failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may
adversely affect us.

We are
subject to risks that affect the general retail environment.

A substantial portion of our properties are in the
retail shopping center real estate market and we have a significant investment
in Toys.  This means that we are subject to factors that affect the retail
environment generally, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence,
the threat of terrorism and increasing competition from discount retailers,
outlet malls, retail websites and catalog companies.  These factors could
adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants and the retailer
in which we hold an investment and the willingness of retailers to lease space
in our shopping centers, and in turn, adversely affect us.


Our investment in Toys subjects us
to risks that are different from our other lines of business and may result in
increased seasonality and volatility in our reported earnings.

Because Toys is a retailer, its operations subject
us to the risks of a retail company that are different than those presented by
our other lines of business. The business of Toys is highly seasonal and
substantially all of Toys net income is generated in its fourth quarter. In
addition, our fiscal year ends on December 31 whereas, as is common for
retailers, Toys’ fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31.
Therefore, we record our pro rata share of Toys’ net earnings on a one-quarter
lag basis. For example, our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2013
include Toys’ financial results for its first, second and third quarters ended
November 2, 2013, as well as Toys’ fourth quarter results of 2012.
Because of the seasonality of Toys, our reported quarterly net income shows
increased volatility. We may also, in the future and from time to time, invest
in other businesses that may report financial results that are more volatile than
our historical financial results.

We
depend upon our anchor tenants to attract shoppers.

We own several regional malls and other shopping
centers that are typically anchored by well-known department stores and other
tenants who generate shopping traffic at the mall or shopping center. The value
of our properties would be adversely affected if tenants or anchors failed to
meet their contractual obligations, sought concessions in order to continue
operations or ceased their operations, including as a result of bankruptcy. If
the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly
due to economic conditions, closing of anchors or for other reasons, tenants
may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the event
of a default by a tenant or anchor, we may experience delays and costs in
enforcing our rights as landlord.

Our decision to dispose of real estate
assets would change the holding period assumption in our valuation analyses,
which could result in material impairment losses and adversely affect our
financial results.

We evaluate
real estate assets for impairment based on the projected cash flow of the asset
over our anticipated holding period.  If we change our intended holding period,
due to our intention to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset, then under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we
must reevaluate whether that asset is impaired.  Depending on the carrying
value of the property at the time we change our intention and the amount that
we estimate we would receive on disposal, we may record an impairment loss that
would adversely affect our financial results. This loss could be material to
our results of operations in the period that it is recognized.

We
invest in marketable equity securities.  The value of these investments may
decline as a result of operating performance or economic or market conditions.

We invest in marketable equity securities of
publicly-traded companies, such as Lexington Realty Trust.  As of December 31, 2013,
our marketable securities have an aggregate carrying amount of $191,917,000, at
market.  Significant declines in the value of these investments due to, among
other reasons, operating performance or economic or market conditions, may
result in the recognition of impairment losses which could be material.

Our
Organizational and Financial Structure Gives Rise to Operational and Financial
Risks.

We may not be able to
obtain capital to make investments.

We depend primarily on external financing to fund
the growth of our business. This is because one of the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for a REIT is that it distributes
90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its shareholders.
There is a separate requirement to distribute net capital gains or pay a
corporate level tax in lieu thereof. Our access to debt or equity financing
depends on the willingness of third parties to lend or make equity investments
and on conditions in the capital markets generally. Although we believe that we
will be able to finance any investments we may wish to make in the foreseeable
future, there can be no assurance that new financing will be available or
available on acceptable terms.  For information about our available sources of
funds, see

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources”

and the notes to
the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) depends on dividends and
distributions from its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The creditors and
preferred security holders of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts
payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any
dividends or distributions to Vornado.

Substantially all of Vornado’s assets are held
through its Operating Partnership that holds substantially all of its
properties and assets through subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership’s cash
flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by its subsidiaries, and in turn,
substantially all of Vornado’s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to
it by the Operating Partnership. The creditors of each of Vornado’s direct and
indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations
to them, when due and payable, before distributions may be made by that
subsidiary to its equity holders. Thus, the Operating Partnership’s ability to
make distributions to holders of its units depends on its subsidiaries’ ability
first to satisfy their obligations to their creditors and then to make
distributions to the Operating Partnership. Likewise, Vornado’s ability to pay
dividends to holders of common and preferred shares depends on the Operating
Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and
make distributions payable to holders of preferred units and then to make
distributions to Vornado.

Furthermore, the holders of preferred units of the
Operating Partnership are entitled to receive preferred distributions before
payment of distributions to holders of Class A units of the Operating
Partnership, including Vornado. Thus, Vornado’s ability to pay cash dividends
to its shareholders and satisfy its debt obligations depends on the Operating
Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and
make distributions to holders of its preferred units and then to holders of its
Class A units, including Vornado.  As of December 31, 2013, there were three
series of preferred units of the Operating Partnership not held by Vornado with
a total liquidation value of $56,139,000.

In addition, Vornado’s participation in any
distribution of the assets of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries upon
the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency, is only after the claims of the
creditors, including trade creditors and preferred security holders, are
satisfied.

We have
outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may increase and
refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.

We rely on both secured and unsecured, variable
rate and non-variable rate debt to finance acquisitions and development
activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt financing
or refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and
results of operations would likely be adversely affected.  In addition, the
cost of our existing debt may increase, especially in the case of a rising
interest rate environment, and we may not be able to refinance our existing
debt in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms.  If the cost or amount of
our indebtedness increases or we cannot refinance our debt in sufficient
amounts or on acceptable terms, we are at risk of credit ratings downgrades and
default on our obligations that could adversely affect our financial condition
and results of operations.

Covenants
in our debt instruments could adversely affect our financial condition and our
acquisitions and development activities.

The mortgages on our properties contain customary
covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of
the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue
insurance coverage. Our unsecured indebtedness and debt that we may obtain in
the future may contain customary restrictions, requirements and other
limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including covenants that
limit our ability to incur debt based upon the level of our ratio of total debt
to total assets, our ratio of secured debt to total assets, our ratio of EBITDA
to interest expense, and fixed charges, and that require us to maintain a
certain level of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt. Our ability to borrow
is subject to compliance with these and other covenants. In addition, failure
to comply with our covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt
instrument, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from
other sources or give possession of a secured property to the lender. Under
those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or
may be available only on unattractive terms.

Vornado may fail to qualify
or remain qualified as a REIT and may be required to pay income taxes at corporate
rates.

Although we believe that we will remain organized
and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes, we may fail to remain so qualified. Qualifications are governed by
highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which
there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and depend on
various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control.  In
addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court
decisions may significantly change the relevant tax laws and/or the federal
income tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT.  If, with respect to any
taxable year, we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT and do not qualify
under statutory relief provisions, we could not deduct distributions to
shareholders in computing our taxable income and would have to pay federal
income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The federal income
tax payable would include any applicable alternative minimum tax. If we had to
pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute to
shareholders and pay our indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years
involved, and we would no longer be required to make distributions to
shareholders.  In addition, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a
REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification
was lost, unless we were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory
provisions.


We face
possible adverse changes in tax laws, which may result in an increase in our
tax liability.

From time to time changes in state and local tax
laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax
liability. The shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in
recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes.
If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets
or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for
payment of dividends.

Loss of
our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of
our common shares.

We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth,
the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado. 
While we believe that we could find a replacement for him and other key
personnel, the loss of their services could harm our operations and adversely affect
the value of our common shares.

Vornado’s
charter documents and applicable law may hinder any attempt to acquire us.

Our Amended and Restated
Declaration of Trust (the “declaration of trust”) sets limits on the ownership
of our shares.

Generally, for Vornado to maintain its
qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% in
value of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of Vornado may be owned,
directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the
last half of Vornado’s taxable year. The Internal Revenue Code defines
“individuals” for purposes of the requirement described in the preceding
sentence to include some types of entities. Under Vornado’s declaration of trust,
as amended, no person may own more than 6.7% of the outstanding common shares
of any class, or 9.9% of the outstanding preferred shares of any class, with
some exceptions for persons who held common shares in excess of the 6.7% limit
before Vornado adopted the limit and other persons approved by Vornado’s Board
of Trustees. These restrictions on transferability and ownership may delay,
deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might
involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the shareholders.

The Maryland General Corporation Law (the
“MGCL”) contains provisions that may reduce the likelihood of certain takeover
transactions.

The MGCL

imposes
conditions and restrictions on certain “business combinations” (including,
among other transactions, a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or, in
certain circumstances, an asset transfer or issuance of equity securities)
between a Maryland REIT and certain persons who beneficially own at least 10%
of the corporation’s stock (an “interested shareholder”). Unless approved in
advance by the board of trustees of the trust, or otherwise exempted by the
statute, such a business combination is prohibited for a period of five years
after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an
interested shareholder.  After such five-year period, a business combination
with an interested shareholder must be: (a) recommended by the board of
trustees of the trust, and (b) approved by the affirmative vote of at least (i)
80% of the trust’s outstanding shares entitled to vote and (ii) two-thirds of
the trust’s outstanding shares entitled to vote which are not held by the
interested shareholder with whom the business combination is to be effected,
unless, among other things, the trust’s common shareholders receive a “fair
price” (as defined by the statute) for their shares and the consideration is
received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested
shareholder for his or her shares.

In approving a transaction, the Board may provide
that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval,
with any terms and conditions determined by the Board.  Vornado’s Board has
adopted a resolution exempting any business combination between Vornado and any
trustee or officer of Vornado or its affiliates.  As a result, any trustee or
officer of Vornado or its affiliates may be able to enter into business
combinations with Vornado that may not be in the best interest of Vornado’s
shareholders. With respect to business combinations with other persons, the
business combination provisions of the MGCL may have the effect of delaying,
deferring or preventing a change in control of Vornado or other transaction
that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the
shareholders. The business combination statute may discourage others from
trying to acquire control of Vornado and increase the difficulty of
consummating any offer.

Vornado has a classified Board of Trustees and that may
reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Vornado’s Board of Trustees is divided into three
classes of trustees. Trustees of each class are chosen for three-year staggered
terms. Staggered terms of trustees may reduce the possibility of a tender offer
or an attempt to change control of Vornado, even though a tender offer or
change in control might be in the best interest of Vornado’s shareholders.


We
may issue additional shares in a manner that could adversely affect the
likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Vornado’s declaration of trust authorizes the
Board of Trustees to:

·

cause
Vornado to issue additional authorized but unissued common shares or preferred
shares;

·

classify
or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred shares;

·

set
the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified
shares that Vornado issues; and

·

increase,
without shareholder approval, the number of shares of beneficial interest that
Vornado may issue.

The Board of Trustees could establish a series of
preferred shares whose terms could delay, deter or prevent a change in control
of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise
be in the best interest of Vornado’s shareholders, although the Board of
Trustees does not now intend to establish a series of preferred shares of this
kind. Vornado’s declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that
may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado or other transaction
that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our
shareholders.

We may change our policies
without obtaining the approval of our shareholders.

Our operating and financial policies, including
our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other companies,
growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively
determined by our Board of Trustees. Accordingly, our shareholders do not
control these policies.

Our Ownership
Structure and Related-Party Transactions May Give Rise to Conflicts of
Interest.

Steven
Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise substantial influence over us. They
and some of our other trustees and officers have interests or positions in
other entities that may compete with us.

As of December 31, 2013, Interstate Properties, a
New Jersey general partnership, and its partners owned an aggregate of
approximately 6.6% of the common shares of Vornado and 26.3% of the common
stock of Alexander’s Inc. (NYSE: ALX) (“Alexander’s”), which is described
below.  Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the
three partners of Interstate Properties. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado, the managing general partner of
Interstate Properties and the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
of Alexander’s. Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are trustees of Vornado and
also directors of Alexander’s.

Because of these overlapping interests,
Mr. Roth and Interstate Properties and its partners may have substantial influence
over Vornado and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Vornado’s
shareholders for approval. In addition, certain decisions concerning our
operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among
Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate Properties and our other
equity or debt holders. In addition, Mr. Roth, Interstate Properties and
its partners, and Alexander’s currently and may in the future engage in a wide
variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts
of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as which of these
entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business
opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties
and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential
competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted,
competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as
acquisitions and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these
entities.

We currently manage and lease the real estate
assets of Interstate Properties under a management agreement for which we
receive an annual fee equal to 4% of base rent and percentage rent.  See the
related party disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

There may be conflicts of
interest between Alexander’s and us.

As of December 31, 2013, we owned 32.4% of the
outstanding common stock of Alexander’s. Alexander’s is a REIT that has six
properties, which are located in the greater New York metropolitan area.  In
addition to the 2.1% that they indirectly own through Vornado, Interstate
Properties, which is described above, and its partners owned 26.3% of the
outstanding common stock of Alexander’s as of December 31, 2013. Mr. Roth
is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Office of Vornado, the
managing general partner of Interstate Properties, and the Chairman of the Board
and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s.  Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum
are trustees of Vornado and also directors of Alexander’s and general partners
of Interstate Properties.  Dr. Richard West is a trustee of Vornado and a
director of Alexander’s.  In addition, Joseph Macnow, our Executive Vice
President – Finance and Chief Administrative Officer, is the Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer of Alexander’s.


We manage, develop and lease Alexander’s properties under management and development agreements and leasing agreements under which we receive annual fees from Alexander’s. See the related party disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

The Number of Shares of Vornado Realty Trust and the Market for Those Shares Give Rise to Various Risks.

The trading price of our common shares has been volatile and may fluctuate.

The trading price of our common shares has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control.  In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies.  These broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our common shares.  Among the factors that could affect the price of our common shares are:

·

our financial condition and performance;

·

the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;

·

actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;

·

our dividend policy;

·

the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and fixed income securities;

·

uncertainty and volatility in the equity and credit markets;

·

fluctuations in interest rates;

·

changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs;

·

failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;

·

speculation in the press or investment community;

·

strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;

·

the extent of institutional investor interest in us;

·

the extent of short-selling of our common shares and the shares of our competitors;

·

fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;

·

general financial and economic market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for REITs and other real estate related companies;

·

domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; and

·

all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report on the Form 10-K.

A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for shareholders.

Vornado has many shares available for future sale, which could hurt the market price of its shares.

The interests of our current shareholders could be diluted if we issue additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2013, we had authorized but unissued, 62,715,312 common shares of beneficial interest, $.04 par value and 57,266,023 preferred shares of beneficial interest, no par value; of which 20,356,425 common shares are reserved for issuance upon redemption of Class A Operating Partnership units, convertible securities and employee stock options and 11,200,000 preferred shares are reserved for issuance upon redemption of preferred Operating Partnership units.  Any shares not reserved may be issued from time to time in public or private offerings or in connection with acquisitions.  In addition, common and preferred shares reserved may be sold upon issuance in the public market after registration under the Securities Act or under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or other available exemptions from registration.  We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common and preferred shares or Operating Partnership Class A and preferred units will have on the market prices of our outstanding shares.

In addition, under Maryland law, the Board has the authority to increase the number of authorized shares without shareholder approval.

New York

As of December 31, 2013, our New York segment consisted of 27.3 million square feet in 71 properties.  The 27.3 million square feet is comprised of 19.8 million square feet of office space in 31 properties, 2.4 million square feet of retail space in 55 properties, four residential properties containing 1,653 units, the 1.4 million square foot Hotel Pennsylvania, and our 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”), which owns six properties in the greater New York metropolitan area.  The New York segment also includes 10 garages totaling 1.7 million square feet (4,909 spaces) which are managed by, or leased to, third parties.

New York lease terms generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 20 years for major tenants, and may provide for extension options at market rates.  Leases typically provide for periodic step‑ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants their share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year.  Electricity is provided to tenants on a sub-metered basis or included in rent based on surveys and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases.  Leases also typically provide for free rent and tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.

As of December 31, 2013, the occupancy rate for our New York segment, in which we own 21.4 million square feet (of a total of 27.3 million square feet), was 96.8%.  The statistics provided in the following sections include information for our share of the office, retail and residential space.

Washington, DC

As of December 31, 2013, our Washington, DC segment consisted of 71 properties aggregating 19.2 million square feet.  The 19.2 million square feet is comprised of 16.2 million square feet of office space in 59 properties, seven residential properties containing 2,405 units, a hotel property, and 20.8 acres of undeveloped land.  The Washington, DC segment also includes 56 garages totaling approximately 8.9 million square feet (29,611 spaces) which are managed by, or leased to, third parties.

Washington, DC office lease terms generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 15 years for major tenants, and may provide for extension options at either pre-negotiated or market rates. Leases typically provide for periodic step-ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants, the tenants’ share of increases in real estate taxes and certain property operating expenses over a base year. Periodic step-ups in rent are usually based upon either fixed percentage increases or the consumer price index. Leases also typically provide for free rent and tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.

As of December 31, 2013, the occupancy rate for our Washington DC segment, in which we own 16.6 million square feet (of a total of 19.2 million square feet), was 83.4%, and 29.0% of the occupied space was leased to various agencies of the U.S. Government.  The statistics provided in the following sections include information for our share of the office and residential space.

Base Realignment and Closure (“BRAC”)

Our Washington, DC segment was impacted by the BRAC statute, which required the Department of Defense (“DOD”) to relocate from 2,395,000 square feet in our buildings in the Northern Virginia area to government owned military bases.  See page 46 for the status of BRAC related move-outs and the sluggish leasing environment in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area, and its impact on 2013 EBITDA and the estimated impact on 2014 EBITDA.


RETAIL PROPERTIES

As of December 31, 2013, our Retail Properties segment consisted of 112 retail properties aggregating 20.2 million square feet.  Of the 112 retail properties, 106 are strip shopping centers and single tenant retail assets located primarily in the Northeast and California, and six are regional malls located in New York, New Jersey, Virginia and San Juan, Puerto Rico.  Our strip shopping centers and malls are generally located on major highways in mature, densely populated areas, and therefore attract consumers from a regional, rather than a neighborhood market place.  Our strip shopping centers are substantially (approximately 78%) leased to large stores (over 20,000 square feet).

Retail Properties’ lease terms generally range from five years or less in some instances for smaller tenants to as long as 25 years for major tenants.  Leases generally provide for reimbursements of real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges (including roof and structure in strip shopping centers, unless it is the tenant’s direct responsibility), and percentage rents based on tenant sales volume.  Percentage rents accounted for less than 1% of the Retail Properties total revenues during 2013.

As of December 31, 2013, the occupancy rate for the Retail Properties segment, in which we own 18.2 million square feet (of a total of 20.2 million square feet), was 94.3%.  The statistics provided in the following sections includes information for our share of the Strip Shopping Centers and Regional Malls.

________________________________

(1)   FFO
is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors
of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). 
NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gain from
sales of depreciated real estate assets, real estate impairment losses,
depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, extraordinary
items and other specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such
adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are
used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons
of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it
excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains
on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the
value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating
based on existing market conditions.  FFO does not represent cash generated
from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available
to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net
income as a performance measure or cash flows as a liquidity measure.  FFO may
not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Overview

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”).  Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors.  Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 94.0% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2013.  All references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership.

We own and operate office and retail properties (our “core” operations) with large concentrations in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area. In addition, we have a 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX) (“Alexander’s”), which owns six properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, a 32.6% interest in Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”) as well as interests in other real estate and related investments.

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. Below is a table comparing our performance to the FTSE NAREIT Office Index (“Office REIT”) and the Morgan Stanley REIT Index (“RMS”) for the following periods ended December 31, 2013:

(1) Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance.

We intend to achieve our business objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and execute our operating strategies through:

·

Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

·

Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;

·

Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

·

Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;

·

Developing and redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and

·

Investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets.  We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

We compete with a large number of property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments than we are. Principal factors of competition include rents charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided.  See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.

2013 Acquisitions

On September 30, 2013, a joint venture, in which we have a 20.1% interest, acquired 650 Madison Avenue, a 27-story, 594,000 square foot Class A office and retail tower located on Madison Avenue between 59th and 60th Street, for $1.295 billion.  The property contains 523,000 square feet of office space and 71,000 square feet of retail space.  The purchase price was funded with cash and a new $800,000,000 seven-year 4.39% interest-only loan.

On October 4, 2013, we acquired a 92.5% interest in 655 Fifth Avenue, a 57,500 square foot retail and office property located at the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street in Manhattan, for $277,500,000 in cash.

On October 15, 2013, we acquired, for $194,000,000 in cash, land and air rights for 137,000 zoning square feet thereby completing the assemblage for our 220 Central Park South development site in Manhattan.

In addition to the above, during 2013, we acquired three Manhattan street retail properties, in separate transactions, for an aggregate of $65,300,000.

During 2013, we sold an aggregate of $1.430 billion in assets resulting in net proceeds of approximately $940,000,000 and net gains aggregating $435,000,000.  Below are the details of these sales.

Retail Properties

On January 24, 2013, we sold the Green Acres Mall located in Valley Stream, New York, for $500,000,000.  The sale resulted in net proceeds of $185,000,000, after repaying the existing loan and closing costs, and a net gain of $202,275,000.

On April 15, 2013, we sold The Plant, a power strip shopping center in San Jose, California, for $203,000,000.  The sale resulted in net proceeds of $98,000,000, after repaying the existing loan and closing costs, and a net gain of $32,169,000.

On April 15, 2013, we sold a retail property in Philadelphia, which is a part of the Gallery at Market Street, for $60,000,000.  The sale resulted in net proceeds of $58,000,000, and a net gain of $33,058,000.

On September 23, 2013, we sold a retail property in Tampa, Florida for $45,000,000, of which our 75% share was $33,750,000.  Our share of the net proceeds after repaying the existing loan and closing costs were $20,810,000, and our share of the net gain was $8,728,000.

In addition to the above, during 2013, we sold 12 other properties, in separate transactions, for an aggregate of $82,300,000, in cash, which resulted in a net gain aggregating $7,851,000.

New York

On December 17, 2013, we sold 866 United Nations Plaza, a 360,000 square foot office building in Manhattan for $200,000,000.  The sale resulted in net proceeds of $146,439,000 after repaying the existing loan and closing costs, and a net gain of $127,512,000.

Other

On January 23, 2013, we and the other equity holders of LNR entered into a definitive agreement to sell LNR for $1.053 billion, of which our 26.2% share was $275,900,000.  The definitive agreement provided that LNR would not (i) make any cash distributions to the equity holders, including us, through the completion of the sale, which occurred on April 19, 2013, and (ii) take any of the following actions (among others) without the purchaser’s approval, the lending or advancing of any money, the acquisition of assets in excess of specified amounts, or the issuance of equity interests.  The sale was the result of a competitive bidding process that we believe resulted in a sale price that represented the fair value of our investment in LNR.  The sale was consummated on April 19, 2013, and we received net proceeds after transaction and closing costs of $240,474,000.  Notwithstanding the terms of the definitive agreement, in accordance with GAAP, we recorded our pro rata share of LNR’s earnings on a one-quarter lag basis through the date of sale, which increased our investment in LNR above our share of the net sales proceeds and resulted in us recognizing an other than temporary impairment loss on our investment of $27,231,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2013.  LNR’s net loss for the period from January 1, 2013 through April 19, 2013 was $80,654,000, including a $66,241,000 non-cash impairment loss. Our share of the net loss was $21,131,000, including $17,355,000 for our share of the non-cash impairment loss.  In the three months ended June 30, 2013, we recorded our share of the net loss but did not record our share of the non-cash impairment loss, as it was effectively considered in our assessment of “other-than-temporary” impairment loss when we recorded the $27,231,000 impairment loss in the three months ended March 31, 2013.  As a result of recording our share of the net loss of $3,776,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2013, the carrying amount of our investment decreased below our share of the net sales proceeds; accordingly, we recorded an offsetting gain on the sale of our investment.

On April 24,
2013, a site located in the Downtown Crossing district of Boston was sold by a
joint venture, of which we owned a 50% interest.  Our share of the net proceeds
were approximately $45,000,000, which resulted in a $2,335,000 impairment loss
that was recognized in the first quarter.

On October 1, 2013, we sold a parcel of land known as
Harlem Park located at 1800 Park Avenue (at 125

th

Street) in New
York City, for $66,000,000. The sale resulted in net proceeds of $63,000,000
and a net gain of $23,507,000.

2013 Financings

Secured Debt

On
February 20, 2013, we completed a $390,000,000 financing of the retail
condominium located at 666 Fifth Avenue at 53

rd

Street, which we had
acquired December 2012.  The 10-year fixed-rate interest only loan bears
interest at 3.61%.  This property was previously unencumbered.  The net
proceeds from this financing were approximately $387,000,000.

On
March 25, 2013, we completed a $300,000,000 financing of the Outlets at Bergen
Town Center, a 948,000 square foot shopping center located in Paramus, New
Jersey.  The 10-year fixed-rate interest only loan bears interest at 3.56%. 
The property was previously encumbered by a $282,312,000 floating-rate loan.

On
June 7, 2013, we completed a $550,000,000 refinancing of Independence Plaza, a
three-building 1,328 unit residential complex in the Tribeca submarket of
Manhattan.  The five-year fixed-rate interest only mortgage loan bears interest
at 3.48%.  The property was previously encumbered by a $323,000,000
floating-rate loan.  The net proceeds of $219,000,000, after repaying the
existing loan and closing costs, were distributed to the partners, of which our
share was $137,000,000.

On October 30, 2013, we completed the restructuring of
the $678,000,000 (face amount) 5.74% Skyline properties mortgage loan. The loan
was separated into two tranches; a senior $350,000,000 position and a junior
$328,000,000 position. The maturity date has been extended from February 2017
to February 2022, with a one-year extension option. The effective interest rate
is 2.965%. Amounts expended to re-lease the property are senior to the
$328,000,000 junior position.

On November 27, 2013, we completed a
$450,000,000 refinancing of Eleven Penn Plaza, a 1.1 million square foot
Manhattan office building.  The seven-year fixed-rate interest only loan bears
interest at 3.95%. The net proceeds from this refinancing were approximately
$107,000,000 after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.

Unsecured
Revolving Credit Facility

On
March 28, 2013, we extended one of our two $1.25 billion revolving credit
facilities from June 2015 to June 2017, with two six-month extension options.
The interest on the extended facility was reduced from LIBOR plus 135 basis
points to LIBOR plus 115 basis points. In addition, the facility fee was
reduced from 30 basis points to 20 basis points.

Preferred
Securities

On January 25, 2013, we sold 12,000,000 5.40%
Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at a price of
$25.00 per share in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an
effective registration statement.  We retained aggregate net proceeds of $290,306,000,
after underwriters’ discounts and issuance costs, and contributed the net
proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 12,000,000 Series L
Preferred Units (with economic terms that mirror those of the Series L
Preferred Shares).

On February 19, 2013, we redeemed all of the
outstanding 6.75% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares and
6.75% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at par,
for an aggregate of $262,500,000 in cash, plus accrued and unpaid dividends
through the date of redemption.

On May 9, 2013, we redeemed all of the
outstanding 6.875% Series D-15 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units with an
aggregate face amount of $45,000,000 for $36,900,000 in cash, plus accrued and
unpaid distributions through the date of redemption.

Due to the effects of BRAC related move-outs and the sluggish leasing environment in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area, EBITDA from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 was lower than 2011 by $54,857,000 and EBITDA from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 was lower than 2012 by $14,254,000.  We estimate that 2014 EBITDA will be between $10,000,000 and $15,000,000 lower than 2013 EBITDA.


Critical
Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial
statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary
of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of
our consolidated financial statements.  The summary should be read in
conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies
included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Real Estate

Real estate is carried at cost, net of
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Maintenance and repairs are expensed
as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life
of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs
associated with a property to its various components. If we do not allocate
these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real
estate, depreciation expense may be misstated.  As real estate is undergoing development
activities, all property operating expenses directly associated with and
attributable to, the development and construction of a project, including
interest expense, are capitalized to the cost of real property to the extent we
believe such costs are recoverable through the value of the property.  The
capitalization period begins when development activities are underway and ends
when the project is substantially complete.  General and administrative costs
are expensed as incurred.

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess
the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements,
identified intangibles, such as acquired above and below-market leases and
acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and
we allocate purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value
based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and
capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future
cash flows are based on a number of factors, including historical operating
results, known trends and market/economic conditions. Identified intangibles
are recorded at their estimated fair value, separate and apart from goodwill.
Identified intangibles that are determined to have finite lives are amortized
over the period in which they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly
to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired.

As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the carrying
amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $14.9 billion and
$15.2 billion, respectively.  As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the carrying
amounts of identified intangible assets (including acquired above-market
leases, tenant relationships and acquired in-place leases) were $323,322,000
and $415,330,000, respectively, and the carrying amounts of identified
intangible liabilities, a component of “deferred revenue” on our consolidated
balance sheets, were $510,485,000 and $560,989,000, respectively.

Our properties, including any related intangible
assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An
impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate
projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an
undiscounted basis.  An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the
property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses
are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market
information at the time the analyses are prepared.  If our estimates of the
projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions
change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such
differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.  The
evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on
assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements
that could differ materially from actual results.  Plans to hold properties
over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.


Critical
Accounting Policies – continued

Partially Owned Entities

We consolidate entities in which we have a
controlling financial interest.  In determining whether we have a controlling financial
interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the
accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board
representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and
contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as
well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and we are the
primary beneficiary.  We are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE when
we have (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to
absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the
VIE. When the requirements for consolidation are not met, we account for
investments under the equity method of accounting if we have the ability to
exercise significant influence over the entity.  Equity method investments are
initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net
income or loss and cash contributions and distributions each period.
Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or the equity method are
accounted for on the cost method.

Investments in partially owned entities are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is
measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its
estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended
holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are
prepared.  The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned
entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each
investment and market conditions.  If our estimates of the projected future
cash flows, the nature of development activities for properties for which such
activities are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change
based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses
may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated
financial statements.  The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective
and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates
and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.

As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the carrying
amounts of investments in partially owned entities, including Toys “R” Us, was
$1.2 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively.

Mortgage and Mezzanine Loans Receivable

We invest in mortgage and mezzanine loans of
entities that have significant real estate assets.  These investments are either
secured by the real property or by pledges of the equity interests of the
entities owning the underlying real estate.  We record these investments at the
stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium.  We accrete
or amortize any discount or premium over the life of the related receivable
utilizing the effective interest method or straight-line method, if the result
is not materially different. We evaluate the collectability of both interest
and principal of each of our loans whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate such amounts may not be recoverable. A loan is impaired when it is
probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the
existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss
accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the
present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective
interest rate, or as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if
the loan is collateral dependent. If our estimates of the collectability of
both interest and principal or the fair value of our loans change based on
market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be
different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial
statements.

As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the carrying
amounts of mortgage and mezzanine loans receivable, net of a $5,845,000
allowance in 2013, were $170,972,000 and $225,359,000, respectively.


Critical
Accounting Policies – continued

Allowance For Doubtful Accounts

We periodically evaluate the collectability of
amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts ($21,869,000
and $37,674,000 as of December 31, 2013 and 2012) for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the
lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from
the straight-lining of rents ($4,355,000 and $3,165,000 as of December 31, 2013
and 2012, respectively). This receivable arises from earnings recognized in
excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management
exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment
history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These
estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our
consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

We have the following revenue sources and revenue
recognition policies:

·

Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized
over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis
which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases. 
We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the
leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. 
In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance
for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a
reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease.

·

Percentage Rent — income arising from retail tenant leases that is
contingent upon tenant sales exceeding defined thresholds. These rents are
recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., when tenant sales
thresholds have been achieved).

·

Hotel Revenue — income arising from the operation of the Hotel
Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and
banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and
beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been
rendered.

·

Trade Shows Revenue — income arising from the operation of trade shows,
including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows
have occurred.

·

Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide
for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate
taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods
as the expenses are incurred.

·

Management, Leasing and Other Fees — income arising from contractual
agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is
recognized as the related services are performed under the respective
agreements.

·

Cleveland Medical Mart — revenue arising from the development of
the Cleveland Medical Mart.  This revenue was recognized as the related
services were performed under the respective agreements using the criteria set
forth in ASC 605-25,

Multiple Element Arrangements.

Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among
other things, its collectibility. If our assessment of the collectibility of
revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be
material.

Income Taxes

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to
continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) under Sections
856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections,
a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend
to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not
be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its
shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income.
Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If we fail to
distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, or fail to meet
other REIT requirements, we may fail to qualify as a REIT which may result in
substantial adverse tax consequences.


Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Years Ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011

As a result of certain organizational changes and asset sales in 2012, the Merchandise Mart segment no longer met the criteria to be a separate reportable segment; accordingly, effective January 1, 2013, the remaining assets were reclassified to “Other.”  We have also reclassified the prior period segment financial results to conform to the current year presentation.  Below is a summary of net income and a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA

Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Years Ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 - continued

Notes to preceding tabular information:

(1)

EBITDA represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization." We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)

Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax expense (benefit) in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these items from partially owned entities.

(Loss) Income Applicable to Toys

In the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized a net loss of $362,377,000 from our investment in Toys, comprised of $128,919,000 for our 32.6% share of Toys’ net loss and $240,757,000 of non-cash impairment losses (see below), partially offset by $7,299,000 of management fee income.  In the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized net income of $14,859,000 from our investment in Toys, comprised of $45,267,000 for our 32.6% share of Toys’ net income and $9,592,000 of management fee income, partially offset by a $40,000,000 non-cash impairment loss (see below).

We account for Toys on the equity method, which means our investment is increased for our pro rata share of Toys undistributed net income.  At December 31, 2012, we estimated that the fair value of our investment was $40,000,000 less than the carrying amount of $518,041,000 and concluded that the decline in the value of our investment was “other-than-temporary” based on, among other factors, compression of earnings multiples of comparable retailers and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near term.  Accordingly, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $40,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2012.

In the first quarter of 2013, we recognized our share of Toys’ fourth quarter net income of $78,542,000 and a corresponding non-cash impairment loss of the same amount to continue to carry our investment at fair value.

At December 31, 2013, we estimated that the fair value of our investment in Toys was approximately $80,062,000 ($83,224,000 including $3,162,000 for our share of Toys’ accumulated other comprehensive income), or $162,215,000 less than the carrying amount after recognizing our share of Toys third quarter net loss in our fourth quarter.  In determining the fair value of our investment, we considered, among other inputs, a December 31, 2013 third-party valuation of Toys.  We have concluded that the decline in the value of our investment is “other-than-temporary” based on, among other factors, Toys’ 2013 holiday sales results, compression of earnings multiples of comparable retailers and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near term.  Accordingly, we recognized an additional non-cash impairment loss of $162,215,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013.

We will continue to assess the recoverability of our investment each quarter.  To the extent the fair value of our investment does not change, we will recognize a non-cash impairment loss equal to our share of Toys’ fourth quarter net income, if any, in our first quarter of 2014.

This decrease was primarily due to (i) $25,502,000 of higher capitalized interest and (ii) $4,738,000 of interest savings from the restructuring of the Skyline properties mortgage loan in the fourth quarter of 2013, partially offset by (iii) interest expense of $12,319,000 from the financing of the retail condominium at 666 Fifth Avenue in the first quarter of 2013, and (iv) an $8,436,000 prepayment penalty in connection with the refinancing of Eleven Penn Plaza.

Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets

Net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets was $3,407,000 in the year ended December 31, 2013 (comprised primarily of net gains from the sale of marketable securities, land parcels (including Harlem Park), and residential condominiums aggregating $58,245,000, partially offset by a $54,914,000 net loss on sale of J.C. Penney common shares), compared to $13,347,000 in the year ended December 31, 2012 (comprised of net gains from the sale of marketable securities, land parcels and residential condominiums).

Income Tax Benefit (Expense)

In the year ended December 31, 2013, we had an income tax benefit of $6,406,000, compared to an expense of $8,132,000 in the prior year, a decrease in expense of $14,538,000.  This decrease resulted primarily from a reversal of previously accrued deferred tax liabilities in the current year due to a change in the effective tax rate resulting from an amendment of the Washington, DC Unincorporated Business Tax Statute.

compared to $32,018,000 in the prior year, an increase of $31,934,000.  This
increase resulted primarily from (i) $14,095,000 of higher net income allocated
to the noncontrolling interests of our Real Estate Fund, (ii) $13,222,000 of
lower income in the prior year resulting from a priority return on our
investment in 1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street, and (iii)

noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership was $23,659,000 in the
year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $35,327,000 in the prior year, a
decrease of $11,668,000.  This decrease resulted primarily from lower net
income subject to allocation to unitholders.

Preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership
were $1,158,000

in the year ended December 31,

, compared to $9,936,000 in the prior year, a decrease of
$8,778,000.  This decrease resulted primarily from the redemption of the 6.875%

Share Dividends

Preferred share dividends were $82,807,000 in the
year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $76,937,000 in the prior year, an
increase of $5,870,000.  This increase resulted from the issuance of
$300,000,000 of 5.70% Series K cumulative redeemable preferred shares in July
2012 and $300,000,000 of 5.40% Series L cumulative redeemable preferred shares
in January 2013, partially offset by the redemption of $262,500,000 of 6.75%
Series F and Series H cumulative redeemable preferred shares in February 2013
and $75,000,000 of 7.0% Series E cumulative redeemable preferred shares in
August 2012.

Preferred
Unit and Share Redemptions

In year ended
December 31, 2013, we recognized $1,130,000 of expense in connection with
preferred unit and share redemptions, comprised of $9,230,000 of expense from
the redemption of the 6.75% Series F and Series H cumulative redeemable
preferred shares in February 2013, partially offset by an $8,100,000 discount
from the redemption of all of the 6.875% Series D-15 cumulative redeemable
preferred units in May 2013.  In the year ended December 31, 2012, we
recognized an $8,948,000 discount primarily from the redemption of all of the
7.0% Series D-10 and 6.75% Series D-14 cumulative redeemable preferred units.

Same Store EBITDA

Same store EBITDA represents EBITDA from property level operations which are owned by us in both the current and prior year reporting periods.  Same store EBITDA excludes segment-level overhead expenses, which are expenses that we do not consider to be property-level expenses, as well as other non-operating items.  We present same store EBITDA on both a GAAP basis and a cash basis (which excludes income from the straight-lining of rents, amortization of below-market leases, net of above-market leases and other non-cash adjustments).  We present these non-GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers.  Same store EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Below is the reconciliation of EBITDA to same store EBITDA on a GAAP basis for each of our segments for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to year ended December 31, 2012.

Notes to preceding tabular information:

New York:

The $44,759,000 increase in New York GAAP basis same store EBITDA resulted primarily from increases in Office and Retail of $32,415,000 and $9,595,000, respectively.  The Office increase resulted primarily from higher (i) rental revenue of $16,405,000 (primarily due to a $1.85 increase in average annual rents per square foot) and (ii) signage revenue and management and leasing fees of $16,151,000.  The Retail increase resulted primarily from higher rental revenue of $10,710,000, (primarily due to a $9.35 increase in average annual rents per square foot).

Washington, DC:

The $10,323,000 decrease in Washington, DC GAAP basis same store EBITDA resulted primarily from lower rental revenue of $15,267,000, primarily due to a 330 basis point decrease in office average same store occupancy to 82.8% from 86.1%, a significant portion of which resulted from the effects of BRAC related move-outs and the sluggish environment in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area (see page 46).

Retail Properties:

The $6,481,000 increase in Retail Properties GAAP basis same store EBITDA resulted primarily from higher rental revenue of $7,322,000, due to a 130 basis point increase in average same store occupancy to 93.5% from 92.2%, and a $0.19 increase in average annual rents per square foot.

$519,157,000 in the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $25,444,000.  This

exchangeable and convertible senior debentures in April 2012 and November 2011,
respectively, (ii) $15,604,000 of higher capitalized interest and (iii)

shares in April 2011 and $300,000,000 of 5.70% Series K cumulative redeemable
preferred shares in July 2012, partially offset by the redemption of
$75,000,000 of 7.0% Series E cumulative redeemable preferred shares in August
2012.

Notes to preceding tabular information:

New York:

The
$15,591,000 increase in New York GAAP basis same store EBITDA resulted
primarily from an increase in Office of $13,029,000.  The Office increase
resulted from higher rental revenue of $29,671,000 (primarily due to a $1.93
increase in average annual rents per square foot), partially offset by an
increase in operating expenses.

Washington, DC:

The
$35,167,000 decrease in Washington, DC GAAP basis same store EBITDA resulted
primarily from lower rental revenue of $38,658,000, primarily due to a 740
basis point decrease in office average same store occupancy to 86.2% from
93.6%, a significant portion of which resulted from the effects of BRAC related
move-outs and the sluggish leasing environment in the Washington, DC / Northern
Virginia area (see page 46).

Retail Properties:

The
$3,076,000 increase in Retail Properties GAAP basis same store EBITDA resulted
primarily from higher rental revenue of $7,004,000, due to an increase in
average same store occupancy and average annual rents per square foot.

Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 - continued

Notes to preceding tabular information:

(1)

EBITDA represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization." We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)

Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax (benefit) expense in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these items from partially owned entities.

Same Store EBITDA

Same store EBITDA represents EBITDA from property level operations which are owned by us in both the current and prior year reporting periods.  Same store EBITDA excludes segment-level overhead expenses, which are expenses that we do not consider to be property-level expenses, as well as other non-operating items.  We present same store EBITDA on both a GAAP basis and a cash basis (which excludes income from the straight-lining of rents, amortization of below-market leases, net of above-market leases and other non-cash adjustments).  We present these non-GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers.  Same store EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Below is the reconciliation of EBITDA to same store EBITDA on a GAAP basis for each of our segments for the three months ended December 31, 2013, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2012.

Related Party Transactions

Alexander’s

We own 32.4% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, the
Chairman of our Board and Chief Executive Officer is also the Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s.  We provide various services
to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and leasing
agreements.  These agreements are described in Note 6 -

Investments in
Partially Owned Entities

to our consolidated financial statements in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Interstate
Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr.
Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr.,
Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s, are Interstate’s two other
partners. As of December 31, 2013, Interstate and its partners beneficially
owned an aggregate of approximately 6.6% of the common shares of beneficial
interest of Vornado and 26.3% of Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of
Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual
fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent.  The management
agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless
terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term.  We
believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies,
that the management agreement terms are fair to us.  We earned $606,000,
$794,000, and $787,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years
ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Property rental income is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, debt service, leasing commissions, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, as well as acquisition and development costs.    Other sources of liquidity to fund cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, and our revolving credit facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity; and asset sales.

We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures.  Capital requirements for development expenditures and acquisitions may require funding from borrowings and/or equity offerings.

We may from time to time purchase or retire outstanding debt securities.  Such purchases, if any will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors.  The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Dividends

On January 15, 2014, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.73 per share (an indicated annual rate of $2.92 per common share).  This dividend, if continued for all of 2014, would require us to pay out approximately $547,000,000 of cash for common share dividends.  In addition, during 2014, we expect to pay approximately $82,000,000 of cash dividends on outstanding preferred shares and approximately $33,000,000 of cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations

We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a “well-known seasoned issuer.”  We have issued publicly senior unsecured notes from a shelf registration statement that contain financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt, and that require us to maintain a level of unencumbered assets based on the level of our secured debt.  Our revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB.  Our revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.  As of December 31, 2013, we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants required by our senior unsecured notes and our revolving credit facilities.

As of December 31, 2013, we had $583,290,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $2,171,009,000 of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, net of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit of $295,870,000 and $33,121,000, respectively.

Details of 2013 financing activities are provided in the “Overview” of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.  Details of 2012 financing activities are discussed below.

Secured Debt

On January 9, 2012, we completed a $300,000,000 refinancing of 350 Park Avenue, a 559,000 square foot Manhattan office building. The five-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 3.75% and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the third year. The proceeds of the new loan and $132,000,000 of existing cash were used to repay the existing loan and closing costs.

On March 5, 2012, we completed a $325,000,000 refinancing of 100 West 33

rd

Street, a 1.1 million square foot property located between 32

nd

and 33

rd

Streets in Manhattan.  The building contains the 257,000 square foot Manhattan Mall and 848,000 square feet of office space.  The three-year loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% and has two one-year extension options.  We retained net proceeds of approximately $87,000,000, after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.

On July 26, 2012, we completed a $150,000,000 refinancing of 2101 L Street, a 380,000 square foot office building located in Washington, DC. The 12-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 3.97% and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the third year.

On August 17, 2012, we completed a $98,000,000 refinancing of 435 Seventh Avenue, a 43,000 square foot retail property in Manhattan. The seven-year loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.25%. We retained net proceeds of approximately $44,000,000, after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.

On November 8, 2012, we completed a $950,000,000 refinancing of 1290 Avenue of the Americas (70% owned), a 2.1 million square foot Manhattan office building. The 10-year fixed rate interest-only loan bears interest at 3.34%.  The partnership retained net proceeds of approximately $522,000,000, after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.

On November 16, 2012, we completed a $120,000,000 refinancing of 4 Union Square South, a 206,000 square foot Manhattan retail property. The seven-year loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.15% and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the third year. We retained net proceeds of approximately $42,000,000, after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.

Activities and Contractual Obligations – continued

Senior Unsecured Debt

In
April 2012, we redeemed all of the outstanding exchangeable and convertible
senior debentures at par, for an aggregate of $510,215,000 in cash.

Preferred Securities

On
July 11, 2012, we sold 12,000,000 5.70% Series K Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Shares at a price of $25.00 per share in an underwritten public
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement.  We retained
aggregate net proceeds of $290,971,000, after underwriters’ discounts and
issuance costs and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in
exchange for 12,000,000 Series K Preferred Units (with economic terms that
mirror those of the Series K Preferred Shares).  Dividends on the Series K
Preferred Shares are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears.  The Series K
Preferred Shares are not convertible into, or exchangeable for, any of our
properties or securities.  On or after five years from the date of issuance (or
sooner under limited circumstances), we may redeem the Series K Preferred
Shares at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid
dividends through the date of redemption. The Series K Preferred Shares have no
maturity date and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless redeemed by us.

On July 19, 2012, we redeemed all of the
outstanding 7.0% Series D-10 and 6.75% Series D-14 cumulative redeemable

Acquisitions and Investments

Details of 2013
acquisitions and investments are provided in the “Overview” of Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. 
Details of 2012 acquisitions and investments are discussed below.

Marriott
Marquis Times Square - Retail and Signage

On July 30, 2012, we entered
into a lease with Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE: HST) (“Host”), under
which we will redevelop the retail and signage components of the Marriott
Marquis Times Square Hotel.  The Marriott Marquis with over 1,900 rooms is
one of the largest hotels in Manhattan.  We plan to redevelop and
substantially expand the existing retail space, including converting the below
grade parking garage into retail, and creating six-story, 300 foot wide block
front, dynamic LED signs.  During the term of the lease we will pay fixed
rent equal to the sum of $12,500,000, plus a portion of the property’s net cash
flow after we receive a 5.2% preferred return on our invested capital. 
The lease contains put/call options which, if exercised, would lead to our
ownership.  Host can exercise the put option during defined periods
following the conversion of the project to a condominium.  We can exercise
our call option under the same terms, at any time after the fifteenth year of
the lease term.

Fifth Avenue - Retail

On December 6, 2012, we
acquired a retail condominium located at 666 Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street for
$707,000,000 in cash. The property contains 114,000 square feet, 39,000 square
feet in fee and 75,000 square feet by long-term lease from the 666 Fifth Avenue
office condominium, which is 49.5% owned by us.

Independence Plaza

In 2011, we acquired a 51% interest in the
subordinated debt of Independence Plaza, a three-building 1,328 unit
residential complex in the Tribeca submarket of Manhattan which has 54,500
square feet of retail space and 550 parking spaces, for $45,000,000 and a
warrant to purchase 25% of the equity for $1,000,000.  On December 21, 2012, we
acquired a 58.75% interest in the property as follows: (i) buying one of the
equity partners’ 33.75% interest for $160,000,000, (ii) exercising our warrant
for 25% of the equity and (iii) contributing the appreciated value of our
interest in the subordinated debt as preferred equity.  In connection
therewith, we recognized income of $105,366,000, comprised of $60,396,000 from
the accelerated amortization of the discount on the subordinated debt
immediately preceding the conversion to preferred equity, and a $44,970,000
purchase price fair value adjustment upon exercising the warrant.  The
transaction valued the property at $844,800,000. We manage the retail space at
the property and Stellar Management, our partner, manages the residential
space.

Vornado Capital Partners Real Estate Fund (the “Fund”)

During 2012,
the Fund made four investments aggregating $203,700,000.  At December 31, 2012,
the Fund had nine investments with an aggregate fair value of $600,786,000, or
$67,642,000 in excess of cost.

Development and Redevelopment Expenditures

We are in the process of renovating the Springfield Mall, which is expected to be completed in 2015.  The incremental development cost of this project is approximately $250,000,000, of which $97,600,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2013, approximately $130,000,000 is expected to be expended in 2014, and the balance of $22,400,000 is expected to be expended in 2015.

We are in the process of redeveloping and substantially expanding the existing retail space at the Marriott Marquis Times Square Hotel, including converting the below grade parking garage into retail and creating a six-story, 300 foot wide block front, dynamic LED sign, all of which is expected to be completed in 2015.  The incremental development cost of this project is approximately $215,000,000, of which $52,100,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2013, approximately $118,000,000 is expected to be expended in 2014, and the balance of $44,900,000 is expected to be expended in 2015.

We plan to construct a residential condominium tower containing 472,000 zoning square feet on our 220 Central Park South development site.  The incremental development cost of this project is approximately $850,000,000.  In February 2014, we completed a $600,000,000 loan secured by this site.

We plan to develop a 699-unit residential project in Pentagon City (Metropolitan Park 4&5), which is expected to be completed in 2016.  The project will include a 37,000 square foot Whole Foods Market at the base of the building.  The incremental development cost of this project is approximately $250,000,000; a significant portion of which is expected to be financed.

We are in the process of repositioning and re-tenanting 280 Park Avenue (49.5% owned).  Our share of the incremental development cost of this project is approximately $62,000,000, of which $34,700,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2013, and the balance of $27,300,000 is expected to be expended in 2014.

We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in Manhattan, including the Hotel Pennsylvania and in Washington, including 1900 Crystal Drive, Rosslyn and Pentagon City.

There can be no assurance that any of our development or redevelopment projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed, or completed on schedule or within budget.

Insurance

We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods.  Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $180,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, up to a $180,000,000 annual aggregate. We maintain coverage for terrorism acts with limits of $4.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate, and $2.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) terrorism events, as defined by Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, which expires in December 2014.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for NBCR acts.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC.  For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and 15% of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of a covered loss.  We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us.  However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space.  These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans.  As of December 31, 2013, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $342,000,000.

At December 31, 2013, $33,121,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our revolving credit facilities.  Our revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

As of December 31, 2013, w

e expect to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating

approximately $145,000,000.

Funds From Operations (“FFO”)

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”).  NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, extraordinary items and other specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions.  FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flows as a liquidity measure.  FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $641,037,000, or $3.41 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $818,565,000, or $4.39 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2012. FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was a negative $6,784,000, or $0.04 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2013, compared to a positive $55,890,000, or $0.30 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2012.  Details of certain items that affect comparability are discussed in the financial results summary of our “Overview.”

ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We have exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest rates on our consolidated and non-consolidated debt (all of which arises out of non-trading activity) is as follows:

We may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. As of December 31, 2013, we have one interest rate cap with a principal amount of $60,000,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.36%.  This cap is based on a notional amount of $60,000,000 and caps LIBOR at a rate of 7.00%.  In addition, we have one interest rate swap on a $425,000,000 mortgage loan that swapped the rate from LIBOR plus 2.00% (2.17% at December 31, 2013) to a fixed rate of 5.13% for the remaining five-year term of the loan.

As of December 31, 2013, we have investments in mezzanine loans with an aggregate carrying amount of $152,853,000 that are based on variable interest rates which partially mitigate our exposure to a change in interest rates.

Fair Value of Debt

The estimated fair value of our consolidated debt is calculated based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt.  As of December 31, 2013, the estimated fair value of our consolidated debt was $9,802,000,000.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

Shareholders and
Board of Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vornado Realty
Trust (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2013. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in
the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement
schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and
financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Vornado Realty Trust at December
31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
February 24, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting.

2.    Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vornado and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership. All inter-company amounts have been eliminated.  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Literature

In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an update (“ASU 2013-02”) to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 220,

Comprehensive Income

(“Topic 220”). ASU 2013-02 requires additional disclosures regarding significant reclassifications out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive income, including the effect on the respective line items of net income for amounts that are required to be reclassified into net income in their entirety and cross-references to other disclosures providing additional information for amounts that are not required to be reclassified into net income in their entirety. The adoption of this update as of January 1, 2013, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, but resulted in additional disclosures (see Note 12 –

Shareholders’ Equity – Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

).

In June 2013, the FASB issued an update (“ASU 2013-08”) to ASC Topic 946,

Financial Services - Investment Companies

(“Topic 946”). ASU 2013-08 amends the guidance in Topic 946 for determining whether an entity qualifies as an investment company and requires certain additional disclosures. ASU 2013-08 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2013. The adoption of this update as of January 1, 2014, did not have any impact on our real estate fund and our consolidated financial statements.

Significant Accounting Policies

Real Estate:

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly related to the improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete. If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the net book value of the existing property, exceeds the estimated fair value of redeveloped property, the excess is charged to expense. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40 years. Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximate the useful lives of the assets. Additions to real estate include interest expense capitalized during construction of $42,303,000 and $16,801,000 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles, such as acquired above and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and we allocate the purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions.  We record acquired intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases, acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired intangible liabilities (including below–market leases) at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. We amortize identified intangibles that have finite lives over the period they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

2.    Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies - continued

Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis.  An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared.  If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.  The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.  Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.

The table below summarizes impairment losses, acquisition related costs and tenant buy-outs in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

Partially Owned Entities:

We consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest.  In determining whether we have a controlling financial interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and we are the primary beneficiary.  We are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We generally do not control a partially owned entity if the entity is not considered a VIE and the approval of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect to major decisions, such as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange or other disposition of real property, the hiring of a chief executive officer, the commencement, compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or arbitration or the placement of new or additional financing secured by assets of the venture.  We account for investments under the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions each period. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method.

Investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared.  In the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recognized non-cash impairment losses on investments in partially owned entities, aggregating $281,098,000,

$44,936,000 and $13,794,000, respectively.  Included in these amounts are $240,757,000 and $40,000,000 of impairment losses related to our investment in Toys in 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Mortgage and Mezzanine Loans Receivable:

We invest in mortgage and mezzanine loans of entities that have significant real estate assets.  These investments are either secured by the real property or by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate.  We record these investments at the stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium. We accrete or amortize any discount or premium over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest method or straight-line method, if the result is not materially different.  We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such amounts may not be recoverable. A loan is impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  Interest on impaired loans is recognized when received in cash.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities.  The majority of our cash and cash equivalents consists of (i) deposits at major commercial banks, which may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit, (ii) United States Treasury Bills, and (iii) Certificate of Deposits placed through an Account Registry Service (“CDARS”).  To date, we have not experienced any losses on our invested cash.

Restricted Cash:

Restricted cash consists of security deposits, cash restricted for the purposes of facilitating a Section 1031 Like-Kind exchange, cash restricted in connection with our deferred compensation plan and cash escrowed under loan agreements for debt service, real estate taxes, property insurance and capital improvements.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:

We periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents. This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates.  As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had $21,869,000 and $37,674,000, respectively, in allowances for doubtful accounts.  In addition, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had $4,355,000 and $3,165,000, respectively, in allowances for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents.

Deferred Charges:

Direct financing costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements as a component of interest expense. Direct costs related to successful leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the lives of the related leases. All other deferred charges are amortized on a straight line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, in accordance with the terms of the agreements to which they relate.

Revenue Recognition:

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:

•      Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.  We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use.  In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

•      Percentage Rent — income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon tenant sales exceeding defined thresholds. These rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., when tenant sales thresholds have been achieved).

•      Hotel Revenue — income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue is recognized when the services have been rendered.

•      Trade Shows Revenue — income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred.

•      Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.

•      Management, Leasing and Other Fees — income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.

•      Cleveland Medical Mart — revenue arising from the development of the Cleveland Medical Mart.  This revenue was recognized as the related services were performed under the respective agreements using the criteria set forth in ASC 605-25,

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities:

ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, our derivative instruments consisted of an interest rate cap and an interest rate swap.  We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings. We assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction. For derivatives not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.

Income Taxes:

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856‑860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to shareholders 100% of taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.  Dividends distributed for the year ended December 31, 2013, were characterized, for federal income tax income tax purposes, as ordinary income.  Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2012, were characterized, for Federal income tax purposes, as 62.7% ordinary income and 37.3% long-term capital gain.  Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2011 were characterized, for Federal income tax purposes, as 93.2% ordinary income and 6.8% long-term capital gain.

We have elected to treat certain consolidated subsidiaries, and may in the future elect to treat newly formed subsidiaries, as taxable REIT subsidiaries pursuant to an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code that became effective January 1, 2001.  Taxable REIT subsidiaries may participate in non-real estate related activities and/or perform non-customary services for tenants and are subject to Federal and State income tax at regular corporate tax rates. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries had a combined current income tax expense of approximately $9,608,000, $20,336,000 and $26,645,000 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and have immaterial differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities.

4.     Acquisitions

On October 4, 2013, we acquired a 92.5% interest in 655 Fifth Avenue, a 57,500 square foot retail and office property located at the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street in Manhattan, for $277,500,000 in cash. We consolidate the accounts of the property into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

On October 15, 2013, we acquired, for $194,000,000 in cash, land and air rights for 137,000 zoning square feet thereby completing the assemblage for our 220 Central Park South development site in Manhattan.

In addition to the above, during 2013, we acquired three Manhattan street retail properties, in separate transactions, for an aggregate of $65,300,000.

5.    Marketable Securities and Derivative Instruments

Our portfolio of marketable securities is comprised of equity securities that are classified as available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale securities are presented on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses resulting from the mark-to-market of these securities are included in “other comprehensive income (loss).”  Realized gains and losses are recognized in earnings only upon the sale of the securities and are recorded based on the weighted average cost of such securities.

We evaluate our portfolio of marketable securities for impairment each reporting period.  For each of the securities in our portfolio with unrealized losses, we review the underlying cause of the decline in value and the estimated recovery period, as well as the severity and duration of the decline.  In our evaluation, we consider our ability and intent to hold these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for us to recover our cost basis.  We also evaluate the near-term prospects for each of these investments in relation to the severity and duration of the decline.

Investment in Lexington Realty Trust (“Lexington”) (NYSE: LXP)

From the inception of our investment in Lexington in 2008, until the first quarter of 2013, we accounted for our investment under the equity method because of our ability to exercise significant influence over Lexington’s operating and financial policies. As a result of Lexington’s common share issuances, our ownership interest was reduced over time from approximately 17.2% to 8.8% at March 31, 2013. In the first quarter of 2013, we concluded that we no longer have the ability to exercise significant influence over Lexington’s operating and financial policies, and began accounting for this investment as a marketable equity security – available for sale, in accordance with ASC Topic 320,

Investment in J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (“J.C. Penney”) (NYSE: JCP)

At December 31, 2012, we owned 23,400,000 J.C.

In addition, in the first quarter of 2013, we wrote down the remaining 8,584,010 J.C. Penney common shares we owned to fair value, based on J.C. Penney’s March 31, 2013 closing share price of $15.11 per share, and recorded a $39,487,000 impairment loss, which is included in “interest and other investment (loss) income, net” on our consolidated statements of income.

On September 19, 2013, we settled the forward contract and received 4,815,990 J.C. Penney common shares. In connection therewith, we recognized a $33,487,000 loss from the mark-to-market of the derivative position through its settlement date, which is included in “interest and other investment (loss) income, net” on our consolidated statements of income.

Toys “R” Us (“Toys”)

As of December 31, 2013, we own 32.6% of Toys.  We account for our investment in Toys under the equity method and record our share of Toys’ net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because Toys’ fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, and our fiscal year ends on December 31.  The business of Toys is highly seasonal and substantially all of Toys’ net income is generated in its fourth quarter.

At December 31, 2012, we estimated that the fair value of our investment was $40,000,000 less than the carrying amount of $518,041,000 and concluded that the decline in the value of our investment was “other-than-temporary” based on, among other factors, compression of earnings multiples of comparable retailers and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near term.  Accordingly, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $40,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2012.

In the first quarter of 2013, we recognized our share of Toys’ fourth quarter net income of $78,542,000 and a corresponding non-cash impairment loss of the same amount to continue to carry over our investment at fair value.

At December 31, 2013, we estimated that the fair value of our investment in Toys was approximately $80,062,000 ($83,224,000 including $3,162,000 for our share of Toys’ accumulated other comprehensive income), or $162,215,000 less than the carrying amount after recognizing our share of Toys third quarter net loss in our fourth quarter.  In determining the fair value of our investment, we considered, among other inputs, a December 31, 2013 third-party valuation of Toys.  We have concluded that the decline in the value of our investment is “other-than-temporary” based on, among other factors, Toys’ 2013 holiday sales results, compression of earnings multiples of comparable retailers and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near term.  Accordingly, we recognized an additional non-cash impairment loss of $162,215,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013.

We will continue to assess the recoverability of our investment each quarter.  To the extent the fair value of our investment does not change, we will recognize a non-cash impairment loss equal to our share of Toys’ fourth quarter net income, if any, in our first quarter of 2014.

As of December 31, 2013, the carrying amount of our investment in Toys is less than our share of Toys' equity by approximately $322,255,000. This basis difference results primarily from non-cash impairment losses aggregating $280,757,000 that we recognized in 2013 and 2012. We have allocated the basis difference to Toys' real estate (which will be amortized over its estimated useful life), and intangible assets, primarily trade names and trademarks (which is not being amortized and will be recognized upon disposition of our investment).

Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”) (NYSE: ALX)

As of December 31, 2013, we own 1,654,068 Alexander’s commons shares, or approximately 32.4% of Alexander’s common equity.  We manage, lease and develop Alexander’s properties pursuant to the agreements described below which expire in March of each year and are automatically renewable.  As of December 31, 2013, we have a $43,307,000 receivable from Alexander’s for fees under these agreements.

As of December 31, 2013 the market value (“fair value” pursuant to ASC 820) of our investment in Alexander’s, based on Alexander’s December 31, 2013 closing share price of $330.00, was $545,842,000, or $378,057,000 in excess of the carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet.  As of December 31, 2013, the carrying amount of our investment in Alexander’s, excluding amounts owed to us, exceeds our share of the equity in the net assets of Alexander’s by approximately $42,048,000.  The majority of this basis difference resulted from the excess of our purchase price for the Alexander’s common stock acquired over the book value of Alexander’s net assets.  Substantially all of this basis difference was allocated, based on our estimates of the fair values of Alexander’s assets and liabilities, to real estate (land and buildings).  We are amortizing the basis difference related to the buildings into earnings as additional depreciation expense over their estimated useful lives.  This depreciation is not material to our share of equity in Alexander’s net income.  The basis difference related to the land will be recognized upon disposition of our investment.

Management and Development Agreements

We receive an annual fee for managing Alexander’s and all of its properties equal to the sum of (i) $2,800,000, (ii) 2% of the gross revenue from the Rego Park II Shopping Center, (iii) $0.50 per square foot of the tenant-occupied office and retail space at 731 Lexington Avenue, and (iv) $272,000, escalating at 3% per annum, for managing the common area of 731 Lexington Avenue.  In addition, we are entitled to a development fee of 6% of development costs, as defined.

Leasing Agreements

We provide Alexander’s with leasing services for a fee of 3% of rent for the first ten years of a lease term, 2% of rent for the eleventh through twentieth year of a lease term and 1% of rent for the twenty-first through thirtieth year of a lease term, subject to the payment of rents by Alexander’s tenants.  In the event third-party real estate brokers are used, our fee increases by 1% and we are responsible for the fees to the third-parties.  We are also entitled to a commission upon the sale of any of Alexander’s assets equal to 3% of gross proceeds, as defined, for asset sales less than $50,000,000, or 1% of gross proceeds, as defined, for asset sales of $50,000,000 or more.  The total of these amounts is payable to us in annual installments in an amount not to exceed $4,000,000 with interest on the unpaid balance at one-year LIBOR plus 1.0% (1.84% at December 31, 2013).

Other Agreements

Building Maintenance Services (“BMS”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, supervises (i) cleaning, engineering and security services at Alexander’s 731 Lexington Avenue property and (ii) security services at Alexander’s Rego Park I and Rego Park II properties, for an annual fee of the costs for such services plus 6%.  During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recognized $2,036,000, $2,362,000 and $2,442,000 of income, respectively, under these agreements.

LNR Property Corporation (“LNR”)

In January 2013, we and the other equity holders of LNR entered into a definitive agreement to sell LNR for $1.053 billion, of which our share of the net proceeds was $240,474,000.  The definitive agreement provided that LNR would not (i) make any cash distributions to the equity holders, including us, through the completion of the sale, which occurred on April 19, 2013, and (ii) take any of the following actions (among others) without the purchaser’s approval, the lending or advancing of any money, the acquisition of assets in excess of specified amounts, or the issuance of equity interests.  Notwithstanding the terms of the definitive agreement, in accordance with GAAP, we recorded our pro rata share of LNR’s earnings on a one-quarter lag basis through the date of sale, which increased the carrying amount of our investment in LNR above our share of the net sales proceeds and resulted in us recognizing an “other-than-temporary” impairment loss on our investment of $27,231,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2013.  LNR’s net loss for the period from January 1, 2013 through April 19, 2013 was $80,654,000, including a $66,241,000 non-cash impairment loss. Our share of the net loss was $21,131,000, including $17,355,000 for our share of the non-cash impairment loss.  In the three months ended June 30, 2013, we recorded our share of the net loss but did not record our share of the non-cash impairment loss, as it was effectively considered in our assessment of “other-than-temporary” impairment loss when we recorded the $27,231,000 impairment loss in the three months ended March 31, 2013.  As a result of recording our share of the net loss of $3,776,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2013, the carrying amount of our investment decreased below our share of the net sales proceeds; accordingly, we recorded an offsetting gain on the sale of our investment.

Independence Plaza

On December 21, 2012, we acquired a 58.75% economic interest in Independence Plaza, a three-building 1,328 unit residential complex in the Tribeca submarket of Manhattan (the “Property”).  We determined, at that time, that we were the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity (“VIE”) that owned the Property.  Accordingly, we consolidated the operations of the Property from the date of acquisition.  Upon consolidation, our preliminary purchase price allocation was primarily to land ($309,848,000) and building ($527,578,000).  Based on a third party appraisal and additional information about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date, which was obtained subsequent to the acquisition date, we finalized the purchase price allocation in the first quarter of 2013, and retroactively adjusted our December 31, 2012 consolidated balance sheet as follows:

On June 7, 2013, the existing $323,000,000 mortgage loan was refinanced with a $550,000,000 five-year fixed-rate interest only mortgage loan bearing interest at 3.48%.  The net proceeds of $219,000,000, after repaying the existing loan and closing costs, were distributed to the partners, of which our share was $137,000,000.  Simultaneously with the refinancing, we sold an 8.65% economic interest in the Property to our partner for $41,000,000 in cash, which reduced our economic interest to 50.1%.  As a result of this transaction, we determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of the VIE.  Accordingly, we deconsolidated the operations of the Property on June 7, 2013 and began accounting for our investment under the equity method.

650 Madison Avenue

On September 30, 2013, a joint venture, in which we have a 20.1% interest, acquired 650 Madison Avenue, a 27-story, 594,000 square foot Class A office and retail tower located on Madison Avenue between 59

th

and 60

th

Street in Manhattan, for $1.295 billion.  The property contains 523,000 square feet of office space and 71,000 square feet of retail space.  The purchase price was funded with cash and a new $800,000,000 seven-year 4.39% interest-only loan.  We account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method.

The following is a summary of condensed combined financial information for all of our partially owned entities, including Toys, Alexander’s and LNR (sold in April 2013), as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

7.    Mortgage and Mezzanine Loans Receivable

In October 2012, we acquired a 25% participation in a $475,000,000 first mortgage and mezzanine loan for the acquisition and redevelopment of a 10-story retail building at 701 Seventh Avenue in Times Square.  The loan had an interest rate of LIBOR plus 10.2%, with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%.  Of the $475,000,000, we funded $93,750,000, representing our 25% share of the $375,000,000 that was funded at acquisition.  In March 2013, we transferred at par, the 25% participation in the mortgage loan.  The transfer did not qualify for sale accounting given our continuing interest in the mezzanine loan.  Accordingly, we continue to include the 25% participation in the mortgage loan in “Mortgage and Mezzanine Loans Receivable” and have recorded a $59,375,000 liability in “Other Liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet.  On January 14, 2014, the mezzanine loan was repaid.

On April 17, 2013, a $50,091,000 mezzanine loan that was scheduled to mature in August 2015, was repaid. In connection therewith, we received net proceeds of $55,358,000, including prepayment penalties, which resulted in income of $5,267,000, which is included in “interest and other investment (loss) income” on our consolidated statement of income.

As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the carrying amount of mortgage and mezzanine loans receivable was $170,972,000 and $225,359,000, respectively.  These loans have a weighted average interest rate of 11.0% and 10.3% at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively and have maturities ranging from August 2014 to May 2016.

10.    Debt

Mortgages Payable

On February 20, 2013, we completed a $390,000,000 financing of the retail condominium located at 666 Fifth Avenue at 53

rd

Street, which we had acquired December 2012. The 10-year fixed-rate interest only loan bears interest at 3.61%. This property was previously unencumbered. The net proceeds from this financing were approximately $387,000,000.

On March 25, 2013, we completed a $300,000,000 financing of the Outlets at Bergen Town Center, a 948,000 square foot shopping center located in Paramus, New Jersey. The 10-year fixed-rate interest only loan bears interest at 3.56%. The property was previously encumbered by a $282,312,000 floating-rate loan.

On May 13, 2013, we notified the lender that due to tenants vacating the Montehiedra Town Center, its operating cash flow will be insufficient to pay the debt service; accordingly, at our request, the mortgage loan was transferred to the special servicer. We are in discussions with the special servicer to restructure the terms of the loan; there can be no assurance as to the timing and ultimate resolution of these discussions.

On October 30, 2013, we completed the restructuring of the $678,000,000 (face amount) 5.74% Skyline properties mortgage loan. The loan was separated into two tranches; a senior $350,000,000 position and a junior $328,000,000 position. The maturity date has been extended from February 2017 to February 2022, with a one-year extension option. The effective interest rate is 2.965%. Amounts expended to re-lease the property are senior to the $328,000,000 junior position.

On November 27, 2013, we completed a $450,000,000 refinancing of Eleven Penn Plaza, a 1.1 million square foot Manhattan office building.  The seven-year fixed-rate interest only loan bears interest at 3.95%. The net proceeds from this refinancing were approximately $107,000,000 after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.

Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility

On March 28, 2013, we extended one of our two $1.25 billion revolving credit facilities from June 2015 to June 2017, with two six-month extension options. The interest on the extended facility was reduced from LIBOR plus 135 basis points to LIBOR plus 115 basis points. In addition, the facility fee was reduced from 30 basis points to 20 basis points.

11.    Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Redeemable noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheets are primarily comprised of Class A Operating Partnership units held by third parties and  are recorded at the greater of their carrying amount or redemption value at the end of each reporting period.  Changes in the value from period to period are charged to “additional capital” in our consolidated statements of changes in equity.  Class A units may be tendered for redemption to the Operating Partnership for cash; we, at our option, may assume that obligation and pay the holder either cash or Vornado common shares on a one-for-one basis.  Because the number of Vornado common shares outstanding at all times equals the number of Class A units owned by Vornado, the redemption value of each Class A unit is equivalent to the market value of one Vornado common share, and the quarterly distribution to a Class A unitholder is equal to the quarterly dividend paid to a Vornado common shareholder.

Preferred Shares

On January 25, 2013, we sold 12,000,000 5.40% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at a price of $25.00 per share in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement.  We retained aggregate net proceeds of $290,306,000, after underwriters’ discounts and issuance costs and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 12,000,000 Series L Preferred Units (with economic terms that mirror those of the Series L Preferred Shares).  Dividends on the Series L Preferred Shares are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears.  The Series L Preferred Shares are not convertible into, or exchangeable for, any of our properties or securities.  On or after five years from the date of issuance (or sooner under limited circumstances), we may redeem the Series L Preferred Shares at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the date of redemption. The Series L Preferred Shares have no maturity date and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless redeemed by us.

On February 19, 2013, we redeemed all of the outstanding 6.75% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares and 6.75% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at par, for an aggregate of $262,500,000 in cash, plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the date of redemption.

We account for our investment in these entities under the equity method (see Note 6 –

).  As of December 31, 2013, the net carrying amount of our investment in these entities was $152,929,000, and our maximum exposure to loss in these entities, is limited to our investment.  At December 31, 2012, we had one unconsolidated VIE, comprised of our investment in the Warner Building which had a carrying amount of $8,775,000.

14.  Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures

defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value.  The objective of fair value is to determine the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price).

ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels: Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities; Level 2 – observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3 – unobservable inputs that are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible, as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value.  Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret Level 2 and 3 inputs in determining the fair value of our financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.  Accordingly, our fair value estimates, which are made at the end of each reporting period, may be different than the amounts that may ultimately be realized upon sale or disposition of these assets.

Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets consist of (i) marketable securities, (ii) Real Estate Fund investments, (iii) the assets in our deferred compensation plan (for which there is a corresponding liability on our consolidated balance sheet), (iv) interest rate swaps and (v) mandatorily redeemable instruments (Series G-1 through G-4 convertible preferred units and Series D-13 cumulative redeemable preferred units).  The tables below aggregate the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities by their levels in the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Real Estate Fund Investments

At December 31, 2013, our Real Estate Fund had nine investments with an aggregate fair value of $667,710,000, or $153,413,000 in excess of cost.  These investments are classified as Level 3.  We use a discounted cash flow valuation technique to estimate the fair value of each of these investments, which is updated quarterly by personnel responsible for the management of each investment and reviewed by senior management at each reporting period.  The discounted cash flow valuation technique requires us to estimate cash flows for each investment over the anticipated holding period, which currently ranges from 0.6 to 6.5 years.  Cash flows are derived from property rental revenue (base rents plus reimbursements) less operating expenses, real estate taxes and capital and other costs, plus projected sales proceeds in the year of exit.  Property rental revenue is based on leases currently in place and our estimates for future leasing activity, which are based on current market rents for similar space plus a projected growth factor.  Similarly, estimated operating expenses and real estate taxes are based on amounts incurred in the current period plus a projected growth factor for future periods.  Anticipated sales proceeds at the end of an investment’s expected holding period are determined based on the net cash flow of the investment in the year of exit, divided by a terminal capitalization rate, less estimated selling costs.

The fair value of each property is calculated by discounting the future cash flows (including the projected sales proceeds), using an appropriate discount rate and then reduced by the property’s outstanding debt, if any, to determine the fair value of the equity in each investment. Significant unobservable quantitative inputs used in determining the fair value of each investment include capitalization rates and discount rates.  These rates are based on the location, type and nature of each property, and current and anticipated market conditions, which are derived from original underwriting assumptions, industry publications and from the experience of our Acquisitions and Capital Markets departments.  Significant unobservable quantitative inputs in the table below were utilized in determining the fair value of these Fund investments at December 31, 2013.

Range

value of investments)

Discount rates

12.0% to 17.5%

13.9%

Terminal capitalization rates

5.0% to 6.0%

5.5%

The above inputs are subject to change based on changes in economic and market conditions and/or changes in use or timing of exit.  Changes in discount rates and terminal capitalization rates result in increases or decreases in the fair values of these investments.  The discount rates encompass, among other things, uncertainties in the valuation models with respect to terminal capitalization rates and the amount and timing of cash flows.  Therefore, a change in the fair value of these investments resulting from a change in the terminal capitalization rate, may be partially offset by a change in the discount rate.  It is not possible for us to predict the effect of future economic or market conditions on our estimated fair values.

The table below summarizes the changes in the fair value of Fund investments that are classified as Level 3, for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.

Deferred Compensation Plan Assets

Deferred compensation plan assets that are classified as Level 3 consist of investments in limited partnerships and investment funds, which are managed by third parties.  We receive quarterly financial reports from a third-party administrator, which are compiled from the quarterly reports provided to them from each limited partnership and investment fund.  The quarterly reports provide net asset values on a fair value basis which are audited by independent public accounting firms on an annual basis.  The third-party administrator does not adjust these values in determining our share of the net assets and we do not adjust these values when reported in our consolidated financial statements.

for details of impairment losses recognized during 2013 and 2012.  See Note 6

– Investment in Partially Owned Entities

for details of impairment losses related to Toys.  The fair values of these assets are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including (i) discounted cash flow analysis, which considers, among other things, leasing assumptions, growth rates, discount rates and terminal capitalization rates, (ii) income capitalization approach, which considers prevailing market capitalization rates, and (iii) comparable sales activity.  Generally, we consider multiple valuation techniques when measuring fair values but in certain circumstances, a single valuation technique may be appropriate.  The tables below aggregate the fair values of these assets by their levels in the fair value hierarchy.

14.  Fair Value Measurements – continued

Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value

Financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets include cash equivalents (primarily U.S. Treasury Bills), mortgage and mezzanine loans receivable and our secured and unsecured debt.  Estimates of the fair value of these instruments are determined by the standard practice of modeling the contractual cash flows required under the instrument and discounting them back to their present value at the appropriate current risk adjusted interest rate, which is provided by a third-party specialist.  For floating rate debt, we use forward rates derived from observable market yield curves to project the expected cash flows we would be required to make under the instrument.  The fair value of cash equivalents is classified as Level 1 and the fair value of our mortgage and mezzanine loans receivable is classified as Level 3.  The fair value of our secured and unsecured debt is classified as Level 2.  The table below summarizes the carrying amounts and fair value of these financial instruments as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.

15.    Stock-based Compensation

Our Omnibus Share Plan (the “Plan”), which was approved in May 2010, provides the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Committee”) the ability to grant incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted Operating Partnership units and out-performance plan awards to certain of our employees and officers.  Under the Plan, awards may be granted up to a maximum of 6,000,000 shares, if all awards granted are Full Value Awards, as defined, and up to 12,000,000 shares, if all of the awards granted are Not Full Value Awards, as defined, plus shares in respect of awards forfeited after May 2010 that were issued pursuant to our 2002 Omnibus Share Plan.  Full Value Awards are awards of securities, such as restricted shares, that, if all vesting requirements are met, do not require the payment of an exercise price or strike price to acquire the securities.  Not Full Value Awards are awards of securities, such as options, that do require the payment of an exercise price or strike price.  This means, for example, if the Committee were to award only restricted shares, it could award up to 6,000,000 restricted shares.  On the other hand, if the Committee were to award only stock options, it could award options to purchase up to 12,000,000 shares (at the applicable exercise price).  The Committee may also issue any combination of awards under the Plan, with reductions in availability of future awards made in accordance with the above limitations.  As of December 31, 2013, we have approximately

4,672,000

shares available for future grants under the Plan, if all awards granted are Full Value Awards, as defined.

In the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recognized an aggregate of $34,914,000, $30,588,000 and $28,853,000, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense, which is included as a component of “general and administrative” expenses on our consolidated statements of income.  The details of the various components of our stock-based compensation are discussed below.

Out-Performance Plans (“OPP Units”)

On March 30, 2012 and March 15, 2013, the Committee approved the 2012 and 2013 Out-Performance Plans (the “OPPs”), respectively.  The OPPs are multi-year, performance-based equity compensation plans under which participants, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, have the opportunity to earn compensation payable in the form of equity awards if, and only if, we outperform a predetermined total shareholder return (“TSR”) and/or outperform the market with respect to a relative TSR in any year during the requisite performance periods as described below.   The aggregate notional amount of each of the OPPs is $40,000,000.

Awards under the 2012 OPP may be earned if we (i) achieve a TSR level greater than 7% per annum, or 21% over the three-year performance period (the “Absolute Component”), and/or (ii) achieve a TSR above that of the SNL US REIT Index (the “Index”) over a one-year, two-year or three-year performance period (the “Relative Component”).  Awards under the 2013 OPP may be earned if we (i) achieve a TSR greater than 14% over the two-year performance measurement period, or 21% over the three-year performance measurement period (the “Absolute Component”), and/or (ii) achieve a TSR above that of the Index over a two-year or three-year performance measurement period (the “Relative Component”).  To the extent awards would be earned under the Absolute Component of each of the OPPs, but we underperform the Index, such awards would be reduced (and potentially fully negated) based on the degree to which we underperform the Index.  In certain circumstances, in the event we outperform the Index but awards would not otherwise be fully earned under the Absolute Component, awards may still be earned or increased under the Relative Component.  To the extent awards would otherwise be earned under the Relative Component but we fail to achieve at least a 6% per annum absolute TSR, such awards earned under the Relative Component would be reduced based on our absolute TSR, with no awards being earned in the event our TSR during the applicable measurement period is 0% or negative, irrespective of the degree to which we may outperform the Index.  Dividends on awards issued accrue during the performance period.

If the designated performance objectives are achieved, OPP Units are subject to time-based vesting requirements. Awards earned under the OPPs vest 33% in year three, 33% in year four and 34% in year five.  Our executive officers (for the purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act) are required to hold earned 2013 OPP awards for one year following vesting.

The fair value of the 2012 and 2013 OPPs on the date of grant was $12,250,000, and $6,814,000, respectively.  Such amounts are being amortized into expense over a five-year period from the date of grant, using a graded vesting attribution model.  In the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recognized $3,226,000, $2,826,000 and $740,000, respectively, of compensation expense related to OPP Units.  As of December 31, 2013, there was $10,065,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the OPPs, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low market price of our common shares on the NYSE on the date of grant, generally vest over four years and expire 10 years from the date of grant.  Compensation expense related to stock option awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  In the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recognized $8,234,000, $8,638,000 and $8,794,000, respectively, of compensation expense related to stock options that vested during each year.  As of December 31, 2013, there was $5,398,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.3 years.

Restricted Stock

Restricted stock awards are granted at the average of the high and low market price of our common shares on the NYSE on the date of grant and generally vest over four years.  Compensation expense related to restricted stock awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  In the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recognized $1,344,000, $1,604,000 and $1,814,000, respectively, of compensation expense related to restricted stock awards that vested during each year.  As of December 31, 2013, there was $1,781,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.  Dividends paid on unvested restricted stock are charged directly to retained earnings and amounted to $110,000, $200,000 and $185,000 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

20.  Leases

As lessor:

We lease space to tenants under operating leases. Most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base rentals payable monthly in advance. Office building leases generally require the tenants to reimburse us for operating costs and real estate taxes above their base year costs. Shopping center leases provide for pass-through to tenants the tenant’s share of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance. Shopping center leases also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ sales. As of December 31, 2013, future base rental revenue under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding rents for leases with an original term of less than one year and rents resulting from the exercise of renewal options, are as follows:

Excluding the $59,599,000 of income pursuant to a settlement agreement with Stop & Shop in the year ended December 31, 2013, none of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

We are also a lessee under a capital lease under which we will redevelop the retail and signage components of the Marriot Marquis Times Square Hotel.  The lease has put/call options, which if exercised would lead to our ownership.  Capitalized leases are recorded at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the property.  Capitalized leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset or life of the related lease.  Depreciation expense on capital leases is included in “depreciation and amortization” on our consolidated statements of income.

21.  Multiemployer Benefit Plans

Our subsidiaries make contributions to certain multiemployer defined benefit plans (“Multiemployer Pension Plans”) and health plans (“Multiemployer Health Plans”) for our union represented employees, pursuant to the respective collective bargaining agreements.

Multiemployer Pension Plans

Multiemployer Pension Plans differ from single-employer pension plans in that (i) contributions to multiemployer plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers and (ii) if other participating employers fail to make their contributions, each of our participating subsidiaries may be required to bear its then pro rata share of unfunded obligations.  If a participating subsidiary withdraws from a plan in which it participates, it may be subject to a withdrawal liability.  As of December 31, 2013, our subsidiaries’ participation in these plans were not significant to our consolidated financial statements.

In the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, our subsidiaries contributed $10,223,000, $10,683,000 and $10,168,000, respectively, towards Multiemployer Pension Plans, which is included as a component of “operating” expenses on our consolidated statements of income.  Our subsidiaries’ contributions did not represent more than 5% of total employer contributions in any of these plans for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

Multiemployer Health Plans

Multiemployer Health Plans in which our subsidiaries participate provide health benefits to eligible active and retired employees.  In the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, our subsidiaries contributed $26,262,000, $26,759,000 and $23,847,000, respectively, towards these plans, which is included as a component of “operating” expenses on our consolidated statements of income.

22.  Commitments and Contingencies

Insurance

We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods.  Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $180,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, up to a $180,000,000 annual aggregate. We maintain coverage for terrorism acts with limits of $4.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate, and $2.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) terrorism events, as defined by Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, which expires in December 2014.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for NBCR acts.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC.  For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and 15% of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of a covered loss.  We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us.  However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space.  These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans.  As of December 31, 2013, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $342,000,000.

At December 31, 2013, $33,121,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our revolving credit facilities.  Our revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

As of December 31, 2013, w

e expect to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating

approximately $145,000,000.

23.  Related Party Transactions

Alexander’s

We own 32.4% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board and Chief Executive Officer is also the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s.  We provide various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements.  These agreements are described in Note 6 -

Investments in Partially Owned Entities

.

Interstate Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr. Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s, are Interstate’s two other partners. As of December 31, 2013, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 6.6% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 26.3% of Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent.  The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term.  We believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies, that the management agreement terms are fair to us.  We earned $606,000, $794,000, and $787,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

25.  Subsequent Events

2014 Out-Performance Plan

On January 10, 2014, the Compensation Committee approved the 2014 Outperformance Plan, a multi-year, performance-based equity compensation plan and related form of award agreement (the “2014 OPP”).  Under the 2014 OPP, participants have the opportunity to earn compensation payable in the form of operating partnership units during a three-year performance measurement period, if and only if we outperform a predetermined total shareholder return (“TSR”) and/or outperform the market with respect to relative TSR.  Awards under the 2014 OPP may be earned if we (i) achieve a TSR level greater than 7% per annum, or 21% over the three-year performance measurement period (the “Absolute Component”), and/or (ii) achieve a TSR above that of the SNL US REIT Index (the “Index”) over a three-year performance measurement period (the “Relative Component”).  To the extent awards would be earned under the Absolute Component but we underperform the Index, such awards earned under the Absolute Component would be reduced (and potentially fully negated) based on the degree to which we underperform the Index.  In certain circumstances, in the event we outperform the Index but awards would not otherwise be earned under the Absolute Component, awards may be increased under the Relative Component.  To the extent awards would otherwise be earned under the Relative Component but we fail to achieve at least a 6% per annum absolute TSR, such awards earned under the Relative Component would be reduced based on our absolute TSR, with no awards being earned in the event our TSR during the applicable measurement period is 0% or negative, irrespective of the degree to which we may outperform the Index.  If the designated performance objectives are achieved, OPP Units are also subject to time-based vesting requirements. Awards earned under the 2014 OPP vest 33% in year three, 33% in year four and 34% in year five.  Dividends on awards earned accrue during the performance measurement period.  In addition, our executive officers (for the purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act) are required to hold any earned OPP awards (or related equity) for at least one year following vesting.

220 Central Park South Development Site

On January 31, 2014, we completed a $600,000,000 loan secured by our 220 Central Park South development site.  The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% and matures in January 2016, with three one-year extension options.

Broadway Mall

On February 14, 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell the Broadway Mall in Hicksville, Long Island, New York for $94,000,000.  The sale will result in net proceeds of approximately $92,000,000 after closing costs.  In the fourth quarter of 2013, we recognized a $13,443,000 non-cash impairment loss related to this property, which is included in “impairment losses, acquisition related costs and tenant buy-outs” on our consolidated statements of income.

26.    Segment Information

As a result of certain organizational changes and asset sales in 2012, the Merchandise Mart segment no longer met the criteria to be a separate reportable segment; accordingly, effective January 1, 2013, the remaining assets were reclassified to “Other.”  We have also reclassified the prior period segment financial results to conform to the current year presentation.

26.    Segment Information – continued

Notes to preceding tabular information:

(1)

EBITDA represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization." We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)

Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax expense (benefit) in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these items from partially owned entities.

(3)

The elements of "New York" EBITDA are summarized below.

ITEM 9.        changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure

None.

ITEM 9A.     Controls and procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures:  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a‑15 (e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:  There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of Vornado Realty Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As of December 31, 2013, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 was effective.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our trustees; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 145, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board of Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Vornado Realty Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of trustees, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 of the Company and our report dated February 24, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.
