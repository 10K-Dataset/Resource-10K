EXPLANATORY NOTE

This report combines the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

December 31, 2019

of Vornado Realty Trust and Vornado Realty L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to “Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”), and references to the “Operating Partnership” refer to Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. References to the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean collectively Vornado, the Operating Partnership and those subsidiaries consolidated by Vornado.

The Operating Partnership is the entity through which we conduct substantially all of our business and own, either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of our assets. Vornado is the sole general partner and also a

93.1%

limited partner of the Operating Partnership. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, Vornado has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership’s day-to-day management.

Under the limited partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, unitholders may present their Class A units for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of the units that may restrict such right for a period of time). Class A units may be tendered for redemption to the Operating Partnership for cash; Vornado, at its option, may assume that obligation and pay the holder either cash or Vornado common shares on a one-for-one basis. Because the number of Vornado common shares outstanding at all times equals the number of Class A units owned by Vornado, the redemption value of each Class A unit is equivalent to the market value of one Vornado common share, and the quarterly distribution to a Class A unitholder is equal to the quarterly dividend paid to a Vornado common shareholder. This one-for-one exchange ratio is subject to specified adjustments to prevent dilution. Vornado generally expects that it will elect to issue its common shares in connection with each such presentation for redemption rather than having the Operating Partnership pay cash. With each such exchange or redemption, Vornado’s percentage ownership in the Operating Partnership will increase. In addition, whenever Vornado issues common shares other than to acquire Class A units of the Operating Partnership, Vornado must contribute any net proceeds it receives to the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership must issue to Vornado an equivalent number of Class A units of the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT.

The Company believes that combining the Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Vornado and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:

•

enhances investors’ understanding of Vornado and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;

•

eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation because a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both Vornado and the Operating Partnership; and

•

creates time and cost efficiencies in the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.

The Company believes it is important to understand the few differences between Vornado and the Operating Partnership in the context of how Vornado and the Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company. The financial results of the Operating Partnership are consolidated into the financial statements of Vornado. Vornado does not have any significant assets, liabilities or operations, other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership, not Vornado, generally executes all significant business relationships other than transactions involving the securities of Vornado. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the assets of Vornado. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity offerings by Vornado, which are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in exchange for Class A units of partnership in the Operating Partnership, and the net proceeds of debt offerings by Vornado, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for debt securities of the Operating Partnership, as applicable, the Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by the Company’s business. These sources may include working capital, net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under the revolving credit facility, the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties.

PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Vornado is a fully‑integrated REIT and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership. Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders are dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors. Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately

93.1%

of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of

December 31, 2019

.

We currently own all or portions of:

New York:

•

19.1 million square feet of Manhattan office in 35 properties;

•

2.3 million square feet of Manhattan street retail in 70 properties;

•

1,991 units in 10 residential properties;

•

The 1,700 room Hotel Pennsylvania located on Seventh Avenue at 33rd Street in the heart of the Penn District; and

•

A 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”) (NYSE: ALX), which owns seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, including 731 Lexington Avenue, the 1.3 million square foot Bloomberg, L.P. headquarters building.

Other Real Estate and Investments:

•

The

3.7 million square foot

theMART in Chicago;

1.8 million square feet

;

•

A 25.0% interest in Vornado Capital Partners, our real estate fund (the "Fund"). We are the general partner and investment manager of the Fund; and

•

Other real estate and investments.

OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY

Our business objective is to maximize Vornado shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and to execute our operating strategies through:

•

maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

•

investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;

•

acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

•

developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and

•

investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

DISPOSITIONS

We contributed seven properties to Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV and transferred a 48.5% common interest in the joint venture to a group of institutional investors for net cash proceeds of $1.179 billion. We retained the remaining 51.5% common interest and an aggregate $1.828 billion of preferred equity interests in certain of the properties.

:

•

$1.61 billion net proceeds from the sale of 54 condominium units at 220 Central Park South;

DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES

220 Central Park South

We are constructing a residential condominium tower containing 397,000 salable square feet at

220 Central Park South ("220 CPS").

The development cost of this project (exclusive of land cost of $515.4 million) is estimated to be approximately $1.450 billion, of which $1.373 billion has been expended as of December 31, 2019.

Penn District

We are redeveloping PENN1, a 2,545,000 square foot office building located on 34th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenue. The development cost of this project is estimated to be $325,000,000, of which $69,006,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2019.

We are redeveloping PENN2, a 1,795,000 square foot (as expanded) office building, located on the west side of Seventh Avenue between 31st and 33rd Street. The development cost of this project is estimated to be $750,000,000, of which $40,820,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2019.

We are also making districtwide improvements within the Penn District. The development cost of these improvements is estimated to be $100,000,000, of which $6,314,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2019.

Our 95.0% joint venture (the remaining 5.0% is owned by the Related Companies ("Related")) is developing the Farley Office and Retail Building (the "Project"), which will include approximately 844,000 rentable square feet of commercial space, comprised of approximately 730,000 square feet of office space and approximately 114,000 square feet of retail space. The total development cost of the Project is estimated to be approximately $1,030,000,000. As of December 31, 2019, $597,600,000 has been expended.

The joint venture has entered into a development agreement with Empire State Development (“ESD”), an entity of New York State, to build the adjacent Moynihan Train Hall, with Vornado and Related each guaranteeing the joint venture's obligations. The joint venture has entered into a design-build contract with Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders pursuant to which they will build the Moynihan Train Hall, thereby fulfilling all of the joint venture's obligations to ESD. The obligations of Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders have been bonded by Skanska USA and bear a full guaranty from Skanska AB. The development expenditures for the Moynihan Train Hall are estimated to be approximately $1.6 billion, which will be funded by governmental agencies.

On December 19, 2019, we paid Kmart Corporation $34,000,000, of which $10,000,000 is expected to be reimbursed, to early terminate their 141,000 square foot retail space lease at PENN1 which was scheduled to expire in January 2036.

DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES - CONTINUED

Other - continued

We are redeveloping a 165,000 square foot office building at 825 Seventh Avenue, located at the corner of 53rd Street and Seventh Avenue (50.0% interest).

We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in Manhattan including, in particular, the Penn District.

There can be no assurance that the above projects will be completed, completed on schedule or within budget.

COMPETITION

We compete with a large number of real estate investors, property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the global, national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment trends. See "Risk Factors" in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Material factors that may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition are summarized below. We refer to the equity and debt securities of both Vornado and the Operating Partnership as our “securities” and the investors who own shares of Vornado or units of the Operating Partnership, or both, as our “equity holders.” The risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. See “Forward-Looking Statements” contained herein on page 6.

OUR INVESTMENTS ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE NEW YORK CITY METROPOLITAN AREA AND CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING THIS AREA GENERALLY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

A significant portion of our properties is located in the New York City Metropolitan area and is affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent to this area.

In


, approximately

87%

of our net operating income ("NOI", a non-GAAP measure) came from properties located in the New York City metropolitan area. We may continue to concentrate a significant portion of our future acquisitions, development and redevelopment in this area. Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in either the short or long term. Declines in the economy or declines in real estate markets in the New York City metropolitan area could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties. In addition to the factors affecting the national economic condition generally, the factors affecting economic conditions in this region include:

•

financial performance and productivity of the media, advertising, professional services, financial, technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries;

•

business layoffs or downsizing;

•

industry slowdowns;

•

relocations of businesses;

•

changing demographics;

•

increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places;

•

changes in the number of domestic and international tourists to our markets (including as a result of changes in the relative strengths of world currencies);

•

infrastructure quality;

•

changes in rates or the treatment of the deductibility of state and local taxes; and

•

any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.

It is impossible for us to ensure the accuracy of predictions of the future or the effect of trends in the economic and investment climates of the geographic areas in which we concentrate, and more generally of the United States, or the real estate markets in these areas. Local, national or global economic downturns could negatively affect our businesses and profitability.

We are subject to risks that affect the general and New York City retail environments.

Certain of our properties are Manhattan retail properties. Approximately 22% of our NOI is from Manhattan retail properties. As such, these properties are affected by the general and New York City retail environments, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, Manhattan tourism, the threat of terrorism, increasing competition from on-line retailers, other retailers, and outlet malls, and the impact of technological change upon the retail environment generally. These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants, or result in the bankruptcy of such tenants, and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our retail locations, which could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability.

Terrorist attacks may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.

We have significant investments in the New York City, Chicago and San Francisco metropolitan areas. In response to a terrorist attack or the perceived threat of terrorism, tenants in these areas may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in these areas. This, in turn, would trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these areas, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease space on less favorable terms. Furthermore, we may experience increased costs in security, equipment and personnel. As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues and cash flows could decline materially.


Natural disasters and the effects of climate change could have a concentrated impact on the areas where we operate and could adversely impact our results.

Our investments are concentrated in the New York, Chicago and San Francisco metropolitan areas. Natural disasters, including earthquakes, storms, tornados, floods and hurricanes, could cause significant damage to our properties and the surrounding environment or area. Potentially adverse consequences of “global warming,” including rising sea levels, could similarly have an impact on our properties and the economies of the metropolitan areas in which we operate. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for office space in our buildings or the inability of us to operate the buildings at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy at our properties and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our properties against such risks. The incurrence of these losses, costs or business interruptions may adversely affect our operating and financial results.

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS’ VALUE AND INCOME FLUCTUATE DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS.

Our performance and the value of an investment in us are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.

The value of our real estate and the value of an investment in us fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business. These conditions may also adversely impact our revenues and cash flows.

The factors that affect the value of our real estate investments include, among other things:

•

global, national, regional and local economic conditions;

•

competition from other available space;

•

local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area;

•

how well we manage our properties;

•

the development and/or redevelopment of our properties;

•

changes in market rental rates;

•

the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;

•

whether we are able to pass all or portions of any increases in operating costs through to tenants;

•

changes in real estate taxes and other expenses;

•

the ability of state and local governments to operate within their budgets;

•

whether tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property attractive;

•

changes in consumer preferences adversely affecting retailers and retail store values;

•

changes in space utilization by our tenants due to technology, economic conditions and business environment;

•

the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;

•

consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attacks against, the United States or individual acts of violence in public spaces;

•

trends in office real estate;

•

the impact on our retail tenants and demand for retail space at our properties due to increased competition from online shopping;

•

availability of financing on acceptable terms or at all;

•

inflation or deflation;

•

fluctuations in interest rates;

•

our ability to obtain adequate insurance;

•

changes in zoning laws and taxation;

•

government regulation;

•

potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations;

•

natural disasters;

•

general competitive factors; and

•

climate changes.

The rents or sales proceeds we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors. If rental revenues, sales proceeds and/or occupancy levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available for operating costs, to pay indebtedness and for distribution to equity holders. In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs generally do not decline when the related rents decline.


Capital markets and economic conditions can materially affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations as well as the value of an investment in our debt and equity securities.

There are many factors that can affect the value of our debt and equity securities, including the state of the capital markets and the economy. Demand for office and retail space typically declines nationwide due to an economic downturn, bankruptcies, downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting. Government action or inaction may adversely affect the state of the capital markets. The cost and availability of credit may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads, which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our results of operations, and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants. Our inability or the inability of our tenants to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the value of our securities.

U.S. federal tax reform legislation now and in the future could affect REITs generally, the geographic markets in which we operate, the trading of our shares and our results of operations, both positively and negatively, in ways that are difficult to anticipate.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Act”) represented sweeping tax reform legislation that made significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes, as well as international tax rules. As a REIT, we are generally not required to pay federal taxes otherwise applicable to regular corporations if we comply with the various tax regulations governing REITs. Shareholders, however, are generally required to pay taxes on REIT dividends. The 2017 Act and future tax reform legislation could impact our share price or how shareholders and potential investors view an investment in REITs. For example, the decrease in corporate tax rates in the 2017 Act could decrease the attractiveness of the REIT structure relative to companies that are not organized as REITs. In addition, while certain elements of the 2017 Act do not impact us directly as a REIT, they could impact the geographic markets in which we operate as well as our tenants in ways, both positive and negative, that are difficult to anticipate. For example, the limitation in the 2017 Act on the deductibility of certain state and local taxes may make operating in jurisdictions that impose such taxes at higher rates less desirable than operating in jurisdictions imposing such taxes at lower rates. The overall impact of the 2017 Act also depends on the future interpretations and regulations that may be issued by U.S. tax authorities, and it is possible that future guidance could adversely impact us.

Real estate is a competitive business and that competition may adversely impact us.

We compete with a large number of real estate investors, property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market, which may adversely impact the rents we can charge at those properties and our results of operations.

Competition for acquisitions may reduce the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the costs of those acquisitions.

We may acquire properties when we are presented with attractive opportunities. We may face competition for acquisition opportunities from other well-capitalized investors, including publicly traded and privately held REITs, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, pension trusts, partnerships and individual investors, which may adversely affect us because that competition may cause an increase in the purchase price for a desired acquisition property or result in a competitor acquiring the desired property instead of us.

If we are unable to successfully acquire additional properties, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected. In addition, increases in the cost of acquisition opportunities could adversely affect our results of operations.

We depend on leasing space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from tenants who may not be able to pay.

Our financial results depend significantly on leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms. In addition, because a majority of our income comes from renting of real property, our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and funds available for distribution to equity holders will decrease if a significant number of our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain occupancy levels on favorable terms. If a tenant does not pay its rent, we may not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal and other costs. Even if we are able to enforce our rights, a tenant may not have recoverable assets.

We may be adversely affected by trends in office real estate.

Approximately 72% of our NOI is from our office properties. Telecommuting, flexible work schedules, open workplaces and teleconferencing are becoming more common. These practices enable businesses to reduce their office space requirements. There is also an increasing trend among some businesses to utilize shared office spaces and co-working spaces. A continuation of the movement towards these practices could, over time, erode the overall demand for office space and, in turn, place downward pressure on occupancy, rental rates and property valuations.


We may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire.

When our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if tenants do renew or we can relet the space, the terms of renewal or reletting, considering among other things, the cost of improvements to the property and leasing commissions, may be less favorable than the terms in the expired leases. In addition, changes in space utilization by our tenants may impact our ability to renew or relet space without the need to incur substantial costs in renovating or redesigning the internal configuration of the relevant property. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space at similar rates or if we incur substantial costs in renewing or reletting the space, our cash flow and ability to service debt obligations and pay dividends and distributions to equity holders could be adversely affected.

Bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenue, net income and available cash.

From time to time, some of our tenants have declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the future. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could cause us to suffer lower revenues and operational difficulties, including leasing the remainder of the property. As a result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could result in decreased net income and funds available to pay our indebtedness or make distributions to equity holders.

The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cyber security, as well as other disruptions of our IT networks and related systems, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships or reputation, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.

We face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons who access our systems from inside or outside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Although we have not experienced cyber incidents that are individually, or in the aggregate, material, we have experienced cyber attacks in the past, which have thus far been mitigated by preventative, detective, and responsive measures that we have put in place. Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems) and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Unauthorized parties, whether within or outside our company, may disrupt or gain access to our systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through human error, misfeasance, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceit, including break-ins, use of stolen credentials, social engineering, phishing, computer viruses or other malicious codes, and similar means of unauthorized and destructive tampering. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed to not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.

A security breach or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space; require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; subject us to litigation claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, fines, penalties, governmental investigations and enforcement actions or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally. Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

A cyber attack or systems failure could interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting requirements, which could adversely affect us. A cyber attack could also compromise the confidential information of our employees, tenants, customers and vendors. A successful attack could disrupt and materially affect our business operations, including damaging relationships with tenants, customers and vendors. Any compromise of our information security systems could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information (which may be confidential, proprietary and/or commercially sensitive in nature) and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.


Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.

For our properties except the Farley Office and Retail Building, we maintain general liability insurance with limits of

$300,000,000

per occurrence and per property, and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of

$2.0 billion

per occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as flood and earthquake. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of

$350,000,000

per occurrence and in the aggregate, subject to a deductible in the amount of

5%

of the value of the affected property. We maintain coverage for certified terrorism acts with limits of

$6.0 billion

per occurrence and in the aggregate (as listed below),

$1.2 billion

for non-certified acts of terrorism, and

$5.0 billion

per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) terrorism events, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended to date and which has been extended through December 2027.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism including NBCR acts. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of

$1,430,413

and

20%

of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining portion of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC.

For the Farley Office and Retail Building, we maintain general liability insurance with limits of

$100,000,000

per occurrence, and builder’s risk insurance including coverage for existing property and development activities of

$2.8 billion

per occurrence and in the aggregate. We maintain coverage for certified and non-certified terrorism acts with limits of

$1.0 billion

per occurrence and in the aggregate.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism and other events. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We are responsible for uninsured losses and for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.

ADA generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, meet certain Federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the Federal government or the award of damages to private litigants and/or legal fees to their counsel. From time to time persons have asserted claims against us with respect to some of our properties under the ADA, but to date such claims have not resulted in any material expense or liability. If, under the ADA, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to equity holders.

Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.

Changes in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined and phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may affect our financial results.

The chief executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA"), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In response, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, including when LIBOR will cease to be available or when there will be sufficient liquidity in the SOFR markets.

We have outstanding debt and derivatives with variable rates that are indexed to LIBOR. In the transition from the use of LIBOR to SOFR or other alternatives, the level of interest payments we incur may change. In addition, although certain of our LIBOR based obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on certain of our obligations (including transition to an alternative benchmark rate) if LIBOR is not reported, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if LIBOR was available in its current form. Use of alternative interest rates or other LIBOR reforms could result in increased volatility or a tightening of credit markets which could adversely affect our ability to obtain cost-effective financing.


We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and environmental contamination may impair our ability to lease and/or sell real estate.

Our operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also impair our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are also regulated by federal and state laws. We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. Our predecessor companies may be subject to similar liabilities for activities of those companies in the past. We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or related claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure to contamination at or from our properties

.

Each of our properties has been subject to varying degrees of environmental assessment. To date, these environmental assessments have not revealed any environmental condition material to our business. However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, human exposure to contamination or changes in clean-up or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us

.

In addition, we may become subject to costs or taxes, or increases therein, associated with natural resource or energy usage (such as a “carbon tax”). These costs or taxes could increase our operating costs and decrease the cash available to pay our obligations or distribute to equity holders.

We face risks associated with our tenants being designated “Prohibited Persons” by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar requirements.

Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”) maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned (“Prohibited Persons”) from conducting business or engaging in transactions in the United States and thereby restricts our doing business with such persons. In addition, our leases, loans and other agreements may require us to comply with OFAC and related requirements, and any failure to do so may result in a breach of such agreements. If a tenant or other party with whom we conduct business is placed on the OFAC list or is otherwise a party with whom we are prohibited from doing business, we may be required to terminate the lease or other agreement or face other penalties. Any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or otherwise negatively affect our financial results and cash flows.

WE MAY ACQUIRE OR SELL ASSETS OR ENTITIES OR DEVELOP PROPERTIES. OUR FAILURE OR INABILITY TO CONSUMMATE THESE TRANSACTIONS OR MANAGE THE RESULTS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

We face risks associated with property acquisitions.

We have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties, including, but not limited to, large portfolios that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure. Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:

•

even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property, we may be unable to complete that acquisition after making a non-refundable deposit and incurring certain other acquisition-related costs;

•

we may be unable to obtain or assume financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;

•

acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;

•

the actual costs of repositioning, redeveloping or maintaining acquired properties may be greater than our estimates and may require significantly greater time and attention of management than anticipated;

•

the acquisition agreement will likely contain conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction or other conditions that are not within our control, which may not be satisfied;

•

acquired properties may be located in new markets where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business relationships in the area, costs associated with opening a new regional office and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;

•

we may acquire real estate through the acquisition of the ownership entity subjecting us to the risks of that entity and we may be exposed to the liabilities of properties or companies acquired, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition; and


•

we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Any delay or failure on our part to identify, negotiate, finance and consummate such acquisitions in a timely manner and on favorable terms, or operate acquired properties to meet our financial expectations, could impede our growth and have an adverse effect on us, including our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the market value of our securities.

We are exposed to risks associated with property redevelopment and repositioning that could adversely affect us, including our financial condition and results of operations.

We continue to engage in redevelopment and repositioning activities with respect to our properties, and, accordingly, we are subject to certain risks, which could adversely affect us, including our financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, without limitation, (i) the availability and pricing of financing on favorable terms or at all; (ii) the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory approvals; (iii) the potential for the fluctuation of occupancy rates and rents at redeveloped properties, which may result in our investment not being profitable; (iv) start up, repositioning and redevelopment costs may be higher than anticipated; (v) cost overruns and untimely completion of construction (including risks beyond our control, such as weather or labor conditions, or material shortages); (vi) the potential that we may fail to recover expenses already incurred if we abandon development or redevelopment opportunities after we begin to explore them; (vii) the potential that we may expend funds on and devote management time to projects which we do not complete; (viii) the inability to complete leasing of a property on schedule or at all, resulting in an increase in construction or redevelopment costs; and (ix) the possibility that properties will be leased at below expected rental rates. These risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and could prevent the initiation or the completion of redevelopment activities, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the market value of our common shares and ability to satisfy our principal and interest obligations and to make distributions to our shareholders.

From time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions. The announcement of such a material acquisition may result in a rapid and significant decline in the price of our securities.

We are continuously looking at material transactions that we believe will maximize shareholder value. However, an announcement by us of one or more significant acquisitions could result in a quick and significant decline in the price of our securities.

It may be difficult to sell real estate quickly, which may limit our flexibility.

Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Consequently, we may have limited ability to dispose of assets in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions which could have an adverse effect on our sources of working capital and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.

We may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the debt associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs. In addition, when we dispose of or sell assets, we may not be able to reinvest the sales proceeds and earn similar returns.

As part of an acquisition of a property, or a portfolio of properties, we may agree, and in the past have agreed, not to dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness for a long-term period, unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the seller. These agreements could result in us holding on to properties that we would otherwise sell and not pay down or refinance. In addition, when we dispose of or sell assets, we may not be able to reinvest the sales proceeds and earn returns similar to those generated by the assets that were sold.

From time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control. Some of these companies operate in industries with different risks than investing and operating real estate.

From time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, investments in companies that we may not control, including, but not limited to, Alexander’s, our Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV, and other equity and loan investments. Although these businesses generally have a significant real estate component, some of them operate in businesses that are different from investing and operating real estate. Consequently, we are subject to operating and financial risks of those industries and to the risks associated with lack of control, such as having differing objectives than our partners or the entities in which we invest, or becoming involved in disputes, or competing directly or indirectly with these partners or entities. In addition, we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may adversely affect us.


We are subject to risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures and private equity real estate funds.

We currently own properties through joint ventures and private equity real estate funds with other persons and entities and may in the future acquire or own properties through joint ventures and funds when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. Joint venture and fund investments involve risk, including: the possibility that our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and therefore we may be forced to make contributions to maintain the value of the property; that we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses; that our partners might at any time have business or economic goals that are inconsistent with ours; and that our partners may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our recommendations, instructions or requests. We and our respective joint venture partners may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell, put right or forced sale arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partner’s interest, or to sell the underlying asset, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction, without our consent or on unfavorable terms. In some instances, joint venture and fund partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. These conflicts may include compliance with the REIT requirements, and our REIT status could be jeopardized if any of our joint ventures or funds do not operate in compliance with REIT requirements. To the extent our partners do not meet their obligations to us or our joint ventures or funds, or they take action inconsistent with the interests of the joint venture or fund, we may be adversely affected.

OUR ORGANIZATIONAL AND FINANCIAL STRUCTURE GIVES RISE TO OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS.

We may not be able to obtain capital to make investments.

We depend primarily on external financing to fund the growth of our business. This is because one of the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for a REIT is that it distributes 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its shareholders. This, in turn, requires the Operating Partnership to make distributions to its unitholders. There is a separate requirement to distribute net capital gains or pay a corporate level tax in lieu thereof. Our access to debt or equity financing depends on the willingness of third parties to lend or make equity investments and on conditions in the capital markets generally. Although we believe that we will be able to finance any investments we may wish to make in the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that new financing will be available or available on acceptable terms. For information about our available sources of funds, see

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources”

and the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We depend on dividends and distributions from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. The creditors and preferred equity holders of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to us.

Substantially all of Vornado’s assets are held through its Operating Partnership that holds substantially all of its properties and assets through subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership’s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by its subsidiaries, and in turn, substantially all of Vornado’s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by the Operating Partnership. The creditors of each of Vornado’s direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations to them, when due and payable, before distributions may be made by that subsidiary to its equity holders. Thus, the Operating Partnership’s ability to make distributions to its equity holders depends on its subsidiaries’ ability first to satisfy their obligations to their creditors and then to make distributions to the Operating Partnership. Likewise, Vornado’s ability to pay dividends to its holders of common and preferred shares depends on the Operating Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions to holders of its preferred units and then to make distributions to Vornado.

Furthermore, the holders of preferred units of the Operating Partnership are entitled to receive preferred distributions before payment of distributions to the Operating Partnership’s equity holders, including Vornado. Thus, Vornado’s ability to pay cash dividends to its equity holders and satisfy its debt obligations depends on the Operating Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions to holders of its preferred units and then to its equity holders, including Vornado. As of

December 31, 2019

, there were four series of preferred units of the Operating Partnership not held by Vornado with a total liquidation value of

$55,075,000.

In addition, Vornado’s participation in any distribution of the assets of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency, is only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors and preferred equity holders, are satisfied.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could affect our future operations.

As of

December 31, 2019

, our consolidated mortgages and unsecured indebtedness, excluding related premium, discount and deferred financing costs, net, totaled $7.4 billion. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet our required debt service. Our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments in the market or at our properties, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from our properties. Should such events occur, our operations may be adversely affected. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value.


We have outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may increase and refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.

We rely on both secured and unsecured, variable rate and non-variable rate debt to finance acquisitions and development activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt financing or refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected. In addition, the cost of our existing debt may increase, especially in the case of a rising interest rate environment, and we may not be able to refinance our existing debt in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms. If the cost or amount of our indebtedness increases or we cannot refinance our debt in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, we are at risk of credit ratings downgrades and default on our obligations that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Covenants in our debt instruments could adversely affect our financial condition and our acquisitions and development activities.

The mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the applicable lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage. Our unsecured indebtedness and debt that we may obtain in the future may contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including covenants that limit our ability to incur debt based upon the level of our ratio of total debt to total assets, our ratio of secured debt to total assets, our ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, and fixed charges, and that require us to maintain a certain ratio of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt. Our ability to borrow is subject to compliance with these and other covenants. In addition, failure to comply with our covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt instrument, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from such other sources or give possession of a secured property to the lender. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us or may be available only on unattractive terms.

A downgrade in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.

Our credit rating and the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities and our preferred shares could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and any rating could be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant such action. Moreover, these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our common shares or any other securities. If any of the credit rating agencies that have rated our securities downgrades or lowers its credit rating, or if any credit rating agency indicates that it has placed any such rating on a “watch list” for a possible downgrading or lowering, or otherwise indicates that its outlook for that rating is negative, such action could have a material adverse effect on our costs and availability of funding, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the trading/redemption price of our securities, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our equity holders.

Vornado may fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT and may be required to pay federal income taxes at corporate rates.

Although we believe that Vornado will remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, Vornado may fail to remain so qualified. Qualifications are governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and depend on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the relevant tax laws and/or the federal income tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT. If, with respect to any taxable year, Vornado fails to maintain its qualification as a REIT and does not qualify under statutory relief provisions, Vornado could not deduct distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. The federal income tax payable would include any applicable alternative minimum tax. If Vornado had to pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute to equity holders and pay its indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved, and Vornado would not be required to make distributions to shareholders in that taxable year and in future years until it was able to qualify as a REIT and did so. In addition, Vornado would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost, unless Vornado were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions.

We may face possible adverse federal tax audits and changes in federal tax laws, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.

In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate either have undergone or may undergo tax audits. Although we believe that we have substantial arguments in favor of our positions, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance. There can be no assurance that audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended, including with respect to our hotel ownership structure. We cannot predict if or when any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation, or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. Vornado, its taxable REIT subsidiaries, and our securityholders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation.


We may face possible adverse state and local tax audits and changes in state and local tax law.

Because Vornado is organized and qualifies as a REIT, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but we are subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits. Although we believe that we have substantial arguments in favor of our positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. There can be no assurance that audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends and distributions to our security holders.

Loss of our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common shares and Operating Partnership Class A units.

We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado. While we believe that we could find a replacement for him and other key personnel, the loss of their services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our securities.

VORNADO’S CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND APPLICABLE LAW MAY HINDER ANY ATTEMPT TO ACQUIRE US.

Vornado’s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust (the “declaration of trust”) sets limits on the ownership of its shares.

Generally, for Vornado to maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% in value of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of Vornado may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of Vornado’s taxable year. The Internal Revenue Code defines “individuals” for purposes of the requirement described in the preceding sentence to include some types of entities. Under Vornado’s declaration of trust, as amended, no person may own more than 6.7% of the outstanding common shares of any class, or 9.9% of the outstanding preferred shares of any class, with some exceptions for persons who held common shares in excess of the 6.7% limit before Vornado adopted the limit and other persons approved by Vornado’s Board of Trustees. In addition, our declaration of trust includes restrictions on ownership of our common shares and preferred shares to preserve our status as a "domestically controlled qualified investment entity" within the meaning of Section 897 (h)(4)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. These restrictions on transferability and ownership may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of equity holders.

The Maryland General Corporation Law (the “MGCL”) contains provisions that may reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

The MGCL imposes conditions and restrictions on certain “business combinations” (including, among other transactions, a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or, in certain circumstances, an asset transfer or issuance of equity securities) between a Maryland REIT and certain persons who beneficially own at least 10% of the corporation’s stock (an “interested shareholder”). Unless approved in advance by the board of trustees of the trust, or otherwise exempted by the statute, such a business combination is prohibited for a period of five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder. After such five-year period, a business combination with an interested shareholder must be: (a) recommended by the board of trustees of the trust, and (b) approved by the affirmative vote of at least (i) 80% of the trust’s outstanding shares entitled to vote and (ii) two-thirds of the trust’s outstanding shares entitled to vote which are not held by the interested shareholder with whom the business combination is to be effected, unless, among other things, the trust’s common shareholders receive a “fair price” (as defined by the statute) for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for his or her shares.

In approving a transaction, Vornado’s Board of Trustees may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the Board of Trustees. Vornado’s Board of Trustees has adopted a resolution exempting any business combination between Vornado and any trustee or officer of Vornado or its affiliates. As a result, any trustee or officer of Vornado or its affiliates may be able to enter into business combinations with Vornado that may not be in the best interest of our equity holders. With respect to business combinations with other persons, the business combination provisions of the MGCL may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our equity holders. The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of Vornado and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.

Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL permits our Board of Trustees, without shareholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our declaration of trust or bylaws, to implement certain takeover defenses, including adopting a classified board or increasing the vote required to remove a trustee. Such takeover defenses may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us under the circumstances that otherwise could provide our common shareholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price.


Vornado may issue additional shares in a manner that could adversely affect the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Vornado’s declaration of trust authorizes the Board of Trustees to:

•

cause Vornado to issue additional authorized but unissued common shares or preferred shares;

•

classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred shares;

•

set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified shares that Vornado issues; and

•

increase, without shareholder approval, the number of shares of beneficial interest that Vornado may issue.

Vornado’s Board of Trustees could establish a series of preferred shares whose terms could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado, and therefore of the Operating Partnership, or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our equity holders, although Vornado’s Board of Trustees does not now intend to establish a series of preferred shares of this kind. Vornado’s declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our equity holders.

We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our equity holders.

Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other companies, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization, dividends and distributions, are exclusively determined by Vornado’s Board of Trustees. Accordingly, our equity holders do not control these policies.

OUR OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE AND RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS MAY GIVE RISE TO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

Steven Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of Vornado’s other trustees and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.

As of December 31, 2019, Interstate Properties, a New Jersey general partnership, and its partners beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 7.1% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 26.1% of the common stock of Alexander’s, which is described below. Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the three partners of Interstate Properties. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s. Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s.

Because of these overlapping interests, Mr. Roth and Interstate Properties and its partners may have substantial influence over Vornado, and therefore over the Operating Partnership. In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate Properties and our other equity holders. In addition, Mr. Roth, Interstate Properties and its partners, and Alexander’s currently and may in the future engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as which of these entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these entities.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate Properties under a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. See Note


–

Related Party Transactions

to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

There may be conflicts of interest between Alexander’s and us.

As of

December 31, 2019

, we owned 32.4% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s. Alexander’s is a REIT that has seven properties, which are located in the greater New York metropolitan area. In addition to the 2.3% that they indirectly own through Vornado, Interstate Properties, which is described above, and its partners owned 26.1% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s as of

December 31, 2019

. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s. Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s and general partners of Interstate Properties. Dr. Richard West is a Trustee of Vornado and a Director of Alexander’s. In addition, Joseph Macnow, our Executive Vice President – Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, is the Treasurer of Alexander’s and Matthew Iocco, our Executive Vice President – Chief Accounting Officer, is the Chief Financial Officer of Alexander’s.

We manage, develop and lease Alexander’s properties under management, development and leasing agreements under which we receive annual fees from Alexander’s. These agreements are described in Note 6 -

Investments in Partially Owned Entities

THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF VORNADO REALTY TRUST AND THE MARKET FOR THOSE SHARES GIVE RISE TO VARIOUS RISKS.

The trading price of Vornado’s common shares has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate.

The trading price of Vornado’s common shares has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of several factors, many of which are outside our control. In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market price of Vornado’s common shares and the redemption price of the Operating Partnership’s Class A units. Among those factors are:

•

our financial condition and performance;

•

the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;

•

actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;

•

our dividend policy;

•

the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and fixed income securities;

•

uncertainty and volatility in the equity and credit markets;

•

fluctuations in interest rates;

•

changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs;

•

failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;

•

speculation in the press or investment community;

•

strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;

•

the extent of institutional investor interest in us;

•

the extent of short-selling of Vornado common shares and the shares of our competitors;

•

fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;

•

general financial and economic market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for REITs and other real estate related companies;

•

domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;

•

changes in tax laws and rules; and

•

all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

A significant decline in Vornado’s stock price could result in substantial losses for our equity holders.

Vornado has many shares available for future sale, which could hurt the market price of its shares and the redemption price of the Operating Partnership’s units.

The interests of equity holders could be diluted if we issue additional equity securities. As of

December 31, 2019

, Vornado had authorized but unissued, 59,014,323 common shares of beneficial interest, $.04 par value and 70,384,360 preferred shares of beneficial interest, no par value; of which 21,960,441 common shares are reserved for issuance upon redemption of Class A Operating Partnership units, convertible securities and employee stock options and 11,200,000 preferred shares are reserved for issuance upon redemption of preferred Operating Partnership units. Any shares not reserved may be issued from time to time in public or private offerings or in connection with acquisitions. In addition, common and preferred shares reserved may be sold upon issuance in the public market after registration under the Securities Act or under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or other available exemptions from registration. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of Vornado’s common and preferred shares or Operating Partnership Class A and preferred units will have on the market prices of our securities.

In addition, under Maryland law, Vornado’s Board of Trustees has the authority to increase the number of authorized shares without shareholder approval.

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Vornado Realty Trust

Vornado’s common shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “VNO.”

As of February 1,


, there were 875 holders of record of Vornado common shares.

Vornado Realty L.P.

There is no established trading market for the Operating Partnership's Class A units. Class A units that are not held by Vornado may be tendered for redemption to the Operating Partnership for cash; Vornado, at its option, may assume that obligation and pay the holder either cash or Vornado common shares on a one-for-one basis. Because the number of Vornado common shares outstanding at all times equals the number of Class A units owned by Vornado, the redemption value of each Class A unit is equivalent to the market value of one Vornado common share, and the quarterly distribution to a Class A unit holder is equal to the quarterly dividend paid to a Vornado common shareholder.

As of February 1,


, there were 945 Class A unitholders of record.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities

During 2019, the Operating Partnership issued 1,493,309 Class A units in connection with equity awards issued pursuant to Vornado’s omnibus share plan, including with respect to grants of restricted Vornado common shares and restricted units of the Operating Partnership and upon conversion, surrender or exchange of the Operating Partnership’s units or Vornado stock options, and consideration received included $17,062,788 in cash proceeds. Such units were issued in reliance on an exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

From time to time, in connection with equity awards granted under our Omnibus Share Plan, we may withhold common shares for tax purposes or acquire common shares as part of the payment of the exercise price. Although we treat these as repurchases for certain financial statement purposes, these withheld or acquired shares are not considered by us as repurchases for this purpose.

Information relating to compensation plans under which Vornado’s equity securities are authorized for issuance is set forth under Part III, Item 12 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and such information is incorporated by reference herein.

Recent Purchases of Equity Securities

None.

The graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 31,


in our common shares, the S&P 500 Index and the NAREIT All Equity Index and that all dividends were reinvested without the payment of any commissions. There can be no assurance that the performance of our shares will continue in line with the same or similar trends depicted in the graph below.

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciable real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Introduction

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") within this section is focused on the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, including year-to-year comparisons between these years. Our MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2017, including year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017, can be found in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Overview

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders are dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors. Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately

93.1%

of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of

December 31, 2019

. All references to the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean collectively Vornado, the Operating Partnership and those subsidiaries consolidated by Vornado.

We own and operate office and retail properties with a concentration in the New York City metropolitan area. In addition, we have a 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”) (NYSE: ALX), which owns seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, as well as interests in other real estate and investments.

Our business objective is to maximize Vornado shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. Below is a table comparing Vornado’s performance to the FTSE NAREIT Office Index (“Office REIT”) and the MSCI US REIT Index (“MSCI”) for the following periods ended

December 31, 2019

:

____________________

(1)

Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance.

We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and to execute our operating strategies through:

•

maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

•

investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;

•

acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

•

developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and

•

investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

We compete with a large number of real estate investors, property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the global, national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment trends. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.

Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV

On April 18, 2019 (the “Closing Date”), we entered into a transaction agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) with a group of institutional investors (the “Investors”). The Transaction Agreement provides for a series of transactions (collectively, the “Transaction”) pursuant to which (i) prior to the Closing Date, we contributed our interests in properties located at 640 Fifth Avenue, 655 Fifth Avenue, 666 Fifth Avenue, 689 Fifth Avenue, 697-703 Fifth Avenue, 1535 Broadway and 1540 Broadway (collectively, the “Properties”) to subsidiaries of a newly formed joint venture (“Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV”) and (ii) on the Closing Date, transferred a

48.5%

common interest in Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV to the Investors. The

48.5%

common interest in the joint venture represents an effective

47.2%

interest in the Properties (of which

45.4%

was transferred from Vornado). The Properties include approximately

489,000

square feet of retail space,

327,000

square feet of office space, signage associated with 1535 and 1540 Broadway, the parking garage at 1540 Broadway and the theater at 1535 Broadway.

We retained the remaining

51.5%

common interest in Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV which represents an effective

51.0%

interest in the Properties and an aggregate

$1.828 billion

of preferred equity interests in certain of the properties. We also provided

$500,000,000

of temporary preferred equity on 640 Fifth Avenue until May 23, 2019 when mortgage financing was completed. All of the preferred equity has an annual coupon of

4.25%

for the first five years, increasing to

4.75%

for the next five years and thereafter at a formulaic rate. It can be redeemed under certain conditions on a tax deferred basis.

Net cash proceeds from the Transaction were

$1.179 billion

, after (i) deductions for the defeasance of a

$390,000,000

mortgage loan on 666 Fifth Avenue and the repayment of a

$140,000,000

mortgage loan on 655 Fifth Avenue, (ii) proceeds from a

$500,000,000

mortgage loan on 640 Fifth Avenue, described below, (iii) approximately

$23,000,000

used to purchase noncontrolling investors' interests and (iv) approximately

$53,000,000

of transaction costs (including

$17,000,000

of costs related to the defeasance of the 666 Fifth Avenue mortgage loan).

We continue to manage and lease the Properties. We share control with the Investors over major decisions of the joint venture, including decisions regarding leasing, operating and capital budgets, and refinancings. Accordingly, we no longer hold a controlling financial interest in the Properties which has been transferred to the joint venture. As a result, our investment in Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV is accounted for under the equity method from the date of transfer. The Transaction valued the Properties at

$5.556 billion

resulting in a financial statement net gain of

$2.571 billion

, before noncontrolling interest of

$11,945,000

, including the related step up in our basis of the retained portion of the assets to fair value. The net gain is included in "net gain on transfer to Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV" on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended

December 31, 2019

. The gain for tax purposes was approximately

$735,000,000

.

On May 23, 2019, we received

$500,000,000

from the redemption of our temporary preferred equity in 640 Fifth Avenue. The temporary preferred equity was redeemed from the proceeds of a

$500,000,000

mortgage financing that was completed on the property. The five-year loan, which is guaranteed by us, is interest-only at LIBOR plus

1.01%

. The interest rate was swapped for

four years

to a fixed rate of

3.07%

.

330 Madison Avenue

On July 11, 2019, we sold our

interest in 330 Madison Avenue to our joint venture partner. We received net proceeds of approximately

$100,000,000

after deducting our share of the existing

$500,000,000

mortgage loan resulting in a financial statement net gain of

$159,292,000

. The net gain is included in "net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets" on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended

December 31, 2019

. The gain for tax purposes was approximately

$139,000,000

.

3040 M Street

On September 18, 2019, we completed the

$49,750,000

sale of 3040 M Street, a

44,000

square foot retail building in Washington, DC, which resulted in a net gain of

$19,477,000

which is included in “net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets” on our consolidated statements of income for year ended

December 31, 2019

Leasing Activity

The leasing activity and related statistics in the tables below are based on leases signed during the period and are not intended to coincide with the commencement of rental revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Second generation relet space represents square footage that has not been vacant for more than nine months and tenant improvements and leasing commissions are based on our share of square feet leased during the period.

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note


-

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

, Note 3 -

Revenue Recognition

and Note


-

Leases

to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Real Estate

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly related to the improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete. If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the net book value of the existing property, exceeds the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property, the excess is charged to expense. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from


to


years. Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximate the useful lives of the assets.

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles, such as acquired above and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and we allocate the purchase price based on these assessments which are on a relative fair value basis. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions. We amortize identified intangibles that have finite lives over the period they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired.

As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, were

$10.1 billion

and

$13.1 billion

, respectively. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases, tenant relationships and acquired in-place leases) were

$30,965,000

and

$136,781,000

, respectively, and the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of “deferred revenue” on our consolidated balance sheets, were

$53,539,000

and

$161,594,000

, respectively.

Our properties, including any related right-of-use assets and intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, or market conditions change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated discounted cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on estimates and assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates, capital requirements, capitalization rates and discount rates that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.

Partially Owned Entities

We consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. In determining whether we have a controlling financial interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider (i) whether the entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) in which we are the primary beneficiary or (ii) whether the entity is a voting interest entity in which we have a majority of the voting interests of the entity. We are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We generally do not control a partially owned entity if the approval of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect to decisions that most significantly impact the performance of the partially owned entity. This includes decisions regarding operating/capital budgets, and the placement of new or additional financing secured by the assets of the venture, among others. We account for investments under the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions each period. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for under the cost method.


Critical Accounting Policies - continued

Partially Owned Entities - continued

Investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded when there is a decline in the fair value below the carrying value and we conclude such decline is other-than-temporary. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared.

The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on estimates and assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates, capital requirements, capitalization rates and discount rates that could differ materially from actual results.

As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the carrying amounts of investments in partially owned entities were

$4.0 billion

and

$0.9 billion

, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:

•

Rental revenues include revenues from the leasing of space at our properties to tenants, lease termination income, revenues from the Hotel Pennsylvania, trade shows and tenant services.

◦

Revenues from the leasing of space at our properties to tenants includes (i) lease components, including fixed and variable lease payments, and nonlease components which include reimbursement of common area maintenance expenses, and (ii) reimbursement of real estate taxes and insurance expenses. As lessor, we have elected to combine the lease and nonlease components of our operating lease agreements and account for the components as a single lease component. Revenues derived from fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable period of the lease, together with renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. We commence rental revenue recognition when the underlying asset is available for use by the lessee. Revenue derived from the reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance expenses and common area maintenance expenses are generally recognized in the same period as the related expenses are incurred.

◦

Lease termination income is recognized immediately if a tenant vacates or is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shortened remaining lease term.

◦

Hotel revenue arising from the operation of Hotel Pennsylvania consists of room revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Room revenue is recognized when the rooms are made available for the guest.

◦

Trade shows revenue arising from the operation of trade shows is primarily booth rentals. This revenue is recognized upon the occurrence of the trade shows when the trade show booths are made available for use by the exhibitors.

◦

Tenant services revenue arises from sub-metered electric, elevator, trash removal and other services provided to tenants at their request. This revenue is recognized as the services are transferred.

•

Fee and other income includes management, leasing and other revenue arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities and includes Building Maintenance Services LLC (“BMS”) cleaning, engineering and security services. This revenue is recognized as the services are transferred.

We assess, on an individual lease basis, whether it is probable that we will collect the future lease payments. We consider the tenant's payment history and current credit status when assessing collectability. When collectability is not deemed probable, we write off the tenant's receivables, including straight-line rent receivables, and limit lease income to cash received. Changes to the collectability of our operating leases are recorded as adjustments to "rental revenues" on our consolidated statements of income. If our assessment of the collectability of revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material.

Income Taxes

Vornado operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856‑860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least

90%

of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. Vornado distributes to its shareholders

100%

of its REIT taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.

If Vornado fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders, or fails to meet other REIT requirements, it may fail to qualify as a REIT which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences.

NOI At Share by Segment for the Years Ended

December 31, 2019

and


NOI at share represents total revenues less operating expenses including our share of partially owned entities.

NOI at share - cash basis represents NOI at share adjusted to exclude straight-line rental income and expense, amortization of acquired below and above market leases, net and other non-cash adjustments. We consider NOI at share - cash basis to be the primary non-GAAP financial measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on NOI at share - cash basis, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. NOI at share and NOI at share - cash basis should not be considered alternatives to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Related Party Transactions

See Note 23 -

Related Party Transactions

to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion concerning related party transactions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Rental revenue is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, debt service, leasing commissions, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, as well as acquisition and development costs. Other sources of liquidity to fund cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, unsecured term loans and unsecured revolving credit facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity; and asset sales.

We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures. Capital requirements for development expenditures and acquisitions may require funding from borrowings and/or equity offerings.

We expect to generate net cash of approximately $2 billion resulting from the sales of 100% of the 220 CPS residential condominium units, including $1 billion of after-tax net gain, of which $569,901,000 was recognized in our consolidated statements of income from inception to December 31, 2019.

As of December 31, 2019,

91%

of the condominium units are sold or under sales contracts, with closings scheduled through 2020.

We may from time to time purchase or retire outstanding debt securities or redeem our equity securities. Such purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Dividends

On December 18, 2019, Vornado's Board of Trustees declared a special dividend of $1.95 per share to common shareholders of record on December 30, 2019 (the "Record Date"). On January 15, 2020, $372,380,000 of cash was paid to Vornado's common shareholders and $25,912,000 of cash was paid to non-affiliated unitholders of the Operating Partnership for the special dividend.

On January 15, 2020, Vornado declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.66 per share (an indicated annual rate of $2.64 per common share). This dividend, if declared by the Board of Trustees for all of


, would require Vornado to pay out approximately $504,000,000 of cash for common share dividends. In addition, during


, Vornado expects to pay approximately $50,000,000 of cash dividends on outstanding preferred shares and approximately $35,000,000 of cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations

We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a “well-known seasoned issuer.” We have issued senior unsecured notes from a shelf registration statement that contain financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt, and that require us to maintain a level of unencumbered assets based on the level of our secured debt. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. As of

December 31, 2019

, we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants required by our senior unsecured notes and our unsecured revolving credit facilities.

As of

December 31, 2019

Details of


financing activities are provided in the “Overview” of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. Details of 2018 financing activities are discussed below.

Preferred Securities

On January 4 and 11, 2018, we redeemed all of the outstanding 6.625% Series G and Series I cumulative redeemable preferred shares/ units at their redemption price of $25.00 per share/unit, or $470,000,000 in the aggregate, plus accrued and unpaid dividends/distributions through the date of redemption, and expensed $14,486,000 of previously capitalized issuance costs.

Unsecured Term Loan

On October 26, 2018, we extended our $750,000,000 unsecured term loan from October 2020 to February 2024. The interest rate on the extended unsecured term loan was lowered from LIBOR plus 1.15% to LIBOR plus 1.00%. In connection with the extension of our unsecured term loan, we entered into an interest rate swap from LIBOR plus 1.00% to a fixed rate of 3.87% through October 2023.

Secured Debt

On January 5, 2018, we completed a $100,000,000 refinancing of 33-00 Northern Boulevard (Center Building), a 471,000 square foot office building in Long Island City, New York. The seven-year loan is at LIBOR plus 1.80%, which was swapped to a fixed rate of 4.14%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $37,200,000 after repayment of the existing 4.43% $59,800,000 mortgage and closing costs.

On April 19, 2018, the joint venture between the Fund and the Crowne Plaza Joint Venture completed a $255,000,000 refinancing of the Crowne Plaza Times Square Hotel. The interest-only loan is at LIBOR plus 3.53% and matures in May 2020 with three one-year extension options. In connection therewith, the joint venture purchased an interest rate cap that caps LIBOR at a rate of 4.00%. The Crowne Plaza Times Square Hotel was previously encumbered by a $310,000,000 interest-only mortgage at LIBOR plus 2.80%, which was scheduled to mature in December 2018.

On June 11, 2018, the joint venture that owns Independence Plaza, a three-building 1,327-unit Manhattan residential complex completed a $675,000,000 refinancing of Independence Plaza. The seven-year interest-only loan matures in July 2025 and has a fixed rate of 4.25%. Our share of net proceeds, after repayment of the existing 3.48% $550,000,000 mortgage and closing costs, was $55,618,000.

On August 9, 2018, we completed a $120,000,000 refinancing of 4 Union Square South, a 206,000 square foot Manhattan retail property. The interest-only loan carries a rate of LIBOR plus 1.40% and matures in 2025, as extended. The property was previously encumbered by a $113,000,000 mortgage at LIBOR plus 2.15%, which was scheduled to mature in 2019.

On November 16, 2018, we completed a $205,000,000 refinancing of 150 West 34th Street, a 78,000 square foot Manhattan retail property. The interest-only loan carries a rate of LIBOR plus 1.88% and matures in 2024, as extended. Concurrently, we invested $105,000,000 in a participation in the refinanced mortgage loan, which earns interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.00% and also matures in 2024, as extended, and is included in "other assets" on our consolidated balance sheets. The property was previously encumbered by a mortgage of the same amount at LIBOR plus 2.25%, which was scheduled to mature in 2020.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Our off‑balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures. All debt of our joint venture arrangements is non-recourse to us except for the mortgage loans secured by 640 Fifth Avenue and 7 West 34th Street, which we guaranteed and therefore are part of our tax basis.

Certain Future Cash Requirements

Capital Expenditures

The following table summarizes anticipated 2020 capital expenditures.

The table above excludes anticipated capital expenditures of each of our partially owned non-consolidated subsidiaries, as these entities fund their capital expenditures without additional equity contributions from us.

Development and Redevelopment Expenditures

220 CPS

We are constructing a residential condominium tower containing 397,000 salable square feet at

220 CPS.

The development cost of this project (exclusive of land cost of $515.4 million) is estimated to be approximately $1.450 billion, of which $1.373 billion has been expended as of December 31, 2019.

Penn District

We are redeveloping PENN1, a 2,545,000 square foot office building located on 34th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenue. The development cost of this project is estimated to be $325,000,000, of which $69,006,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2019.

We are redeveloping PENN2, a 1,795,000 square foot (as expanded) office building, located on the west side of Seventh Avenue between 31st and 33rd Street. The development cost of this project is estimated to be $750,000,000, of which $40,820,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2019.

We are also making districtwide improvements within the Penn District. The development cost of these improvements is estimated to be $100,000,000, of which $6,314,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2019.

Our 95.0% joint venture (the remaining 5.0% is owned by the Related Companies ("Related")) is developing the Farley Office and Retail Building (the "Project"), which will include approximately 844,000 rentable square feet of commercial space, comprised of approximately 730,000 square feet of office space and approximately 114,000 square feet of retail space. The total development cost of the Project is estimated to be approximately $1,030,000,000. As of December 31, 2019, $597,600,000 has been expended.

The joint venture has entered into a development agreement with ESD to build the adjacent Moynihan Train Hall, with Vornado and Related each guaranteeing the joint venture's obligations. The joint venture has entered into a design-build contract with Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders pursuant to which they will build the Moynihan Train Hall, thereby fulfilling all of the joint venture's obligations to ESD. The obligations of Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders have been bonded by Skanska USA and bear a full guaranty from Skanska AB. The development expenditures for the Moynihan Train Hall are estimated to be approximately $1.6 billion, which will be funded by governmental agencies.

On December 19, 2019, we paid Kmart Corporation $34,000,000, of which $10,000,000 is expected to be reimbursed, to early terminate their 141,000 square foot retail space lease at PENN1 which was scheduled to expire in January 2036.

We recently entered into a development agreement with Metropolitan Transportation Authority to oversee the development of the Long Island Rail Road 33rd Street entrance at Penn Station which Skanska USA Civil Northeast, Inc. will construct under a fixed price contract for $120,805,000.

Other

We are redeveloping a 78,000 square foot Class A office building at 345 Montgomery Street, a part of our 555 California Street complex in San Francisco (70.0% interest) located at the corner of California and Pine Street. The development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $50,000,000, of which our share is $35,000,000. As of December 31, 2019, $48,087,000 has been expended, of which our share is $33,661,000.

We are redeveloping a 165,000 square foot office building at 825 Seventh Avenue, located at the corner of 53rd Street and Seventh Avenue (50.0% interest). The redevelopment cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $30,000,000, of which our share is $15,000,000. As of December 31, 2019, $23,128,000 has been expended, of which our share is $11,564,000.

We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in Manhattan including, in particular, the Penn District.

There can be no assurance that the above projects will be completed, completed on schedule or within budget.

Insurance

For our properties except the Farley Office and Retail Building, we maintain general liability insurance with limits of

$300,000,000

per occurrence and per property, and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of

$2.0 billion

per occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as flood and earthquake. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of

$350,000,000

per occurrence and in the aggregate, subject to a deductible in the amount of

5%

of the value of the affected property. We maintain coverage for certified terrorism acts with limits of

$6.0 billion

per occurrence and in the aggregate (as listed below),

$1.2 billion

for non-certified acts of terrorism, and

$5.0 billion

per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) terrorism events, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended to date and which has been extended through December 2027.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism including NBCR acts. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of

$1,430,413

and

20%

of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining portion of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC.

For the Farley Office and Retail Building, we maintain general liability insurance with limits of

$100,000,000

per occurrence, and builder’s risk insurance including coverage for existing property and development activities of

$2.8 billion

per occurrence and in the aggregate. We maintain coverage for certified and non-certified terrorism acts with limits of

$1.0 billion

per occurrence and in the aggregate.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism and other events. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We are responsible for uninsured losses and for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.


Liquidity and Capital Resources – continued

Other Commitments and Contingencies

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters is not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

In July 2018, we leased 78,000 square feet at 345 Montgomery Street in San Francisco, CA, to a subsidiary of Regus PLC, for an initial term of 15 years. The obligations under the lease were guaranteed by Regus PLC in an amount of up to $90,000,000. The tenant purported to terminate the lease prior to space delivery. We commenced a suit on October 23, 2019 seeking to enforce the lease and the guarantee.

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us, except for the mortgage loans secured by 640 Fifth Avenue, 7 West 34th Street and 435 Seventh Avenue, which we guaranteed and therefore are part of our tax basis. In certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space. These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans. In addition, we have guaranteed the rent and payments in lieu of real estate taxes due to ESD, an entity of New York State, for the Farley Office and Retail Building. As of

December 31, 2019

, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately

$1,524,000,000

.

As of

December 31, 2019

,

$15,880,000

of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our unsecured revolving credit facilities. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

The joint venture in which we own a

95.0%

ownership interest was designated by ESD to develop the Farley Office and Retail Building.

The joint venture entered into a development agreement with ESD and a design-build contract with Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders. Under the development agreement with ESD, the joint venture is obligated to build the Moynihan Train Hall, with Vornado and Related each guaranteeing the joint venture’s obligations. Under the design-build agreement, Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders is obligated to fulfill all of the joint venture’s obligations. The obligations of Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders have been bonded by Skanska USA and bear a full guaranty from Skanska AB.

As of

Funds From Operations

Vornado Realty Trust

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciable real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The calculations of both the numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note

ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We have exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest rates on our consolidated and non-consolidated debt (all of which arises out of non-trading activity) is as follows:

_______________________

(1)

As a result of the bankruptcy plan of reorganization for Toys "R" Us, Inc. ("Toys") being declared effective and our stock in Toys being canceled, we no longer hold an investment in Toys. Accordingly, no Toys debt is included in our pro rata share of debt of non-consolidated entities.

(2)

Our pro rata share of debt of non-consolidated entities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 is net of our $63,409 share of Alexander's participation in its Rego Park II shopping center mortgage loan which is considered partially extinguished as the participation interest is a reacquisition of debt.

Derivatives and Hedging

We utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. The following table summarizes our consolidated derivative instruments, all of which hedge variable rate debt, as of December 31, 2019.

Fair Value of Debt

The estimated fair value of our consolidated debt is calculated based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt. As of

December 31, 2019

, the estimated fair value of our consolidated debt was

$7,507,000,000

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board of Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vornado Realty Trust and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 18, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

On April 18, 2019, the Company transferred a 48.5% common interest in the joint venture to a group of institutional investors (the “Investors”) and retained the remaining 51.5% common interest in the joint venture and an aggregate $1.828 billion of preferred equity interests in certain of the Properties. Net cash proceeds from the transaction were $1.179 billion. The Company continues to manage and lease the Properties. The Company shares control with the Investors over major decisions of the joint venture, including decisions regarding leasing, operating and capital budgets, and refinancings.


The Company performed a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) and a Voting Interest Entity (“VOE”) analysis for the entities in the organizational structure of the transaction and concluded Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV is a VOE. The Company also determined that the entities in the organizational structure did not meet the criteria to qualify as a VIE. Through its detailed analysis of the various decision-making rights and powers that each party possesses, management concluded that the Company and the Investors both have the ability to block or participate in the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. The Company no longer held a controlling financial interest in the joint venture and as a result deconsolidated the joint venture and began accounting for the investment under the equity method of accounting from the date of transfer. The transaction valued the Properties at $5.556 billion. As a result, there was a step-up in basis of the Company’s retained portion of the Properties to fair value. The gain on transfer consisted of both the gain on the partial sale of the Company’s interest and the gain resulting from the step-up in basis of the retained interest to fair value, less transaction costs, to arrive at an overall net gain of $2.571 billion.

We identified the consolidation analysis as a critical audit matter because the consolidation analysis, specifically the determination of control, and the propriety of gain recognition, involved an interpretation of especially complex accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The evaluation of management’s determination of control required an increased extent of effort.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the accounting treatment of the partial sale included, among other things, the following:

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s determination of control over the joint venture, the resulting deconsolidation of the Properties, and whether a gain or loss should be recognized.

•

We read transaction agreements, traced and agreed the facts included in the Company’s accounting treatment memo to the agreements, and evaluated the assumptions used to arrive at the determined conclusion.

•

We consulted with our consolidation subject matter experts to assess the reasonableness of the Company’s accounting conclusions.

•

We evaluated whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV transaction valued the Properties at $5.556 billion resulting in a financial statement net gain of $2.571 billion. The value was allocated to the assets and liabilities of each property based on their relative fair values. The Company utilized the market approach and the income approach to determine relative fair values. The income approach utilizes the present value of future cash flows that are based on a number of factors, including significant management estimates related to discount rates and capitalization rates, to determine the value of each asset and liability by property.

We identified the valuation of the Properties as a critical audit matter because performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the discount rates and capitalization rates used to determine the value of each asset and liability by property required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the relative fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV transaction included, among other things, the following:

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over the Company’s review of the compilation of inputs related to the valuation and the determination of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including management’s valuation methodology.

•

With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we assessed the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions, such as discount and capitalization rates, using comparable market data.

•

With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the significant assumptions, including testing the source information underlying the determination of these assumptions, testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the assumptions selected by management.

•

We evaluated whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.


Impairment Losses - Refer to Notes 2, 14, and 16 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company’s properties, including any related right-of-use assets and intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying amount over its fair value. The Company’s undiscounted cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on estimates and assumptions such as market rental rates and capitalization rates. In the event a property is not recoverable, the Company’s evaluation of anticipated discounted cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on estimates and assumptions such as market rental rates, capitalization rates, and discount rates that could differ materially from actual results. The Company recognizes impairment losses within “Transaction related costs, impairment losses and other” within the consolidated statements of income. Total non-cash impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $107,221,000.

We identified the impairment of long-lived assets as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management makes to evaluate the recoverability and fair value of the assets, specifically the estimates of market rental rates, capitalization rates, and discount rates for each real estate asset. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the undiscounted and discounted cash flow analyses included, among other things, the following:

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s evaluation of the recoverability of long-lived assets based on undiscounted cash flows and the measurement of impairment based on discounted cash flows, including those over the market rental rates, capitalization rates, and discount rates used in the assessment.

•

With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of significant assumptions in the undiscounted and discounted cash flow analyses, including estimates of market rental rates, capitalization rates, and discount rates, for properties with impairment indicators. We developed independent estimates of the market rental rates, capitalization rates, and discount rates, focusing on geographical location and property type and compared our independent estimates to the estimates and assumptions used by the Company. In addition, we tested the mathematical accuracy of the undiscounted and discounted cash flow analyses.

•

We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s undiscounted and discounted cash flow analyses by comparing management’s projections to the Company’s historical results and external market sources.

•

We evaluated whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Partners

Vornado Realty L.P.

New York, New York

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vornado Realty L.P. and subsidiaries (the "Partnership") as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 18, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Investments in Partially Owned Entities - Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV - Refer to Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

Prior to April 18, 2019, the Partnership contributed its interests in properties located at 640 Fifth Avenue, 655 Fifth Avenue, 666 Fifth Avenue, 689 Fifth Avenue, 697-703 Fifth Avenue, 1535 Broadway, and 1540 Broadway (collectively, the “Properties”) to subsidiaries of a newly formed joint venture (“Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV”). On April 18, 2019, the Partnership transferred a 48.5% common interest in the joint venture to a group of institutional investors (the “Investors”) and retained the remaining 51.5% common interest in the joint venture and an aggregate $1.828 billion of preferred equity interests in certain of the Properties.

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vornado and the Operating Partnership and their consolidated subsidiaries. All inter-company amounts have been eliminated. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Certain prior year balances have been reclassified in order to conform to the current period presentation. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, "property rentals" of

$

1,760,205,000

and

$

1,714,952,000

, respectively, and "tenant expense reimbursements" of

$

247,128,000

and

$

233,424,000

, respectively, were grouped into "rental revenues" on our consolidated statements of income in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 205,

Presentation of Financial Statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Literature

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an update (“ASU 2016-02”) establishing ASC Topic 842,

Leases

("ASC 842"), as amended by subsequent ASUs on the topic, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to apply a two-method approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase. Lessees are required to record a right-of-use ("ROU") asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months. Lease liabilities equal the present value of future lease payments. Right-of-use assets equal the lease liabilities adjusted for accrued rent expense, initial direct costs, lease incentives and prepaid lease payments. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to the previously existing lease guidance under ASC Topic 840,

Leases

("ASC 840"). Lease expense is recognized based on the effective interest method for finance leases or on a straight-line basis for operating leases. The accounting applied by the lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under ASC 840. We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2019. In transitioning to ASC 842, we elected to use the practical expedient package available to us and did not elect to use hindsight. As of January 1, 2019, we had


ground leases classified as operating leases, for which we were required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability equal to the present value of the future lease payments. We will continue to recognize expense on a straight-line basis for these leases. We recorded an aggregate of

$

526,866,000

of ROU assets and a corresponding

$

526,866,000

of lease liabilities as a result of the adoption of this standard (see Note


-

Under ASU 2016-02, initial direct costs for both lessees and lessors would include only those costs that are incremental to the arrangement and would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained. As a result, beginning January 1, 2019, we no longer capitalize internal leasing costs and instead expense these costs as incurred, as a component of "general and administrative" expense on our consolidated statements of income. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we capitalized

$

5,538,000

and

$

5,243,000

, respectively, of internal leasing costs.

In June 2016, the FASB issued an update (“ASU 2016-13”)

Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

establishing ASC Topic 326,

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

, as amended by subsequent ASUs on the topic. ASU 2016-13 changes how entities will account for credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The guidance replaces the current “incurred loss” model with an “expected loss” model that requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of the financial asset. ASU 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements, but do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued an update (“ASU 2018-13”)

Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement

to ASC Topic 820,

Fair Value Measurement

(“ASC 820”). ASU 2018-13 modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying, and/or adding certain disclosures. ASU 2018-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We elected to early adopt ASU 2018-13 effective January 1, 2019. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In October 2018, the FASB issued an update ("ASU 2018-16")

Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes

to ASC Topic 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

. ASU 2018-16 expands the list of U.S. benchmark interest rates permitted in the application of hedge accounting by adding the OIS rate based on SOFR as an eligible benchmark interest rate. ASU 2018-16 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We adopted this update effective January 1, 2019. The adoption of this update did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Significant Accounting Policies

Real Estate:

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly related to the improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete. If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the net book value of the existing property, exceeds the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property, the excess is charged to expense. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from


to


years. Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximate the useful lives of the assets.

Additions to real estate include interest and debt expense capitalized during construction of

$

72,200,000

and

$

73,166,000

for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles, such as acquired above and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and we allocate the purchase price based on these assessments which are on a relative fair value basis. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions. We amortize identified intangibles that have finite lives over the period they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired.

Our properties, including any related right-of-use assets and intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, or market conditions change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated discounted cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on estimates and assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates, capital requirements, capitalization rates and discount rates that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.

We recognized impairment losses of

$

107,221,000

and

$

12,000,000

for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There were

no

impairment losses in the year ended December 31, 2017.

Our

is owned by the Related Companies ("Related")) which is developing the Farley Office and Retail Building has entered into a development agreement with Empire State Development (“ESD”), an entity of New York State, to build the adjacent Moynihan Train Hall, with Vornado and Related each guaranteeing the joint venture's obligations. The joint venture has entered into a design-build contract with Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders pursuant to which they will build the Moynihan Train Hall, thereby fulfilling all of the joint venture's obligations to ESD. The obligations of Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders have been bonded by Skanska USA and bear a full guaranty from Skanska AB. The development expenditures for the Moynihan Train Hall are estimated to be approximately

$

1.6

billion

, which will be funded by governmental agencies. Pursuant to ASC 842-40-55, the joint venture, which we consolidate on our consolidated balance sheets, is required to recognize all development expenditures for the Moynihan Train Hall. Accordingly, the development expenditures paid for by governmental agencies through December 31, 2019 and 2018 of

$

914,960,000

and

Upon completion of the development, the "Moynihan Train Hall development expenditures" and the offsetting “Moynihan Train Hall obligation” will be removed from our consolidated balance sheets.

Partially Owned Entities:

We consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. In determining whether we have a controlling financial interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider (i) whether the entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) in which we are the primary beneficiary or (ii) whether the entity is a voting interest entity in which we have a majority of the voting interests of the entity. We are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We generally do not control a partially owned entity if the approval of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect to decisions that most significantly impact the performance of the partially owned entity. This includes decisions regarding operating/capital budgets, and the placement of new or additional financing secured by the assets of the venture, among others. We account for investments under the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions each period. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for under the cost method.

Partially Owned Entities - continued:

Investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded when there is a decline in the fair value below the carrying value and we conclude such decline is other-than-temporary. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared.

In the year ended December 31,


, we recognized non-cash impairment losses on investments in partially owned entities aggregating

$

44,465,000

.

There were

no

non-cash impairment losses on investments in partially owned entities in the years ended

and 2018.

220 Central Park South Condominium Units Ready For Sale:

We are constructing a residential condominium tower at 220 Central Park South ("220 CPS"). Condominium units are reclassed from "development costs and construction in progress" to "220 Central Park South condominium units ready for sale" upon receipt of the unit's temporary certificate of occupancy. These units are substantially complete and ready for sale. Each unit is carried at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. We have used the relative sales value method to allocate costs to individual condominium units. GAAP income is recognized when legal title transfers upon closing of the condominium unit sales and is included in "net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets" on our consolidated statements of income. As of

December 31, 2019

and 2018, none of the 220 CPS condominium units ready for sale had a carrying value that exceeded fair value.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents consists of (i) deposits at major commercial banks, which may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit, (ii) United States Treasury Bills, and (iii) Certificate of Deposits placed through an Account Registry Service.

Restricted Cash:

Restricted cash consists of security deposits, cash restricted for the purposes of facilitating a Section 1031 Like-Kind exchange, cash restricted in connection with our deferred compensation plan and cash escrowed under loan agreements, including for debt service, real estate taxes, property insurance and capital improvements.

Deferred Charges:

Direct financing costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements as a component of interest expense. Direct costs related to successful leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases. All other deferred charges are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, in accordance with the terms of the agreements to which they relate.

Income Taxes:

Vornado operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856‑860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least


%

of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. Vornado distributes to its shareholders


%

of its REIT taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.

Dividends distributed for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, were characterized, for federal income tax purposes, as

62.1

%

ordinary income and

37.9

%

long-term capital gain. Dividends distributed for the year ended December 31, 2018, were characterized, for federal income tax purposes, as

91.7

%

ordinary income and

8.3

%

long-term capital gain. Dividends distributed for the year ended December 31, 2017, were characterized, for federal income tax purposes, as ordinary income.

On December 18, 2019, Vornado's Board of Trustees declared a special dividend of

$

1.95

per share which was paid on January 15, 2020 to common shareholders of record on December 30, 2019 (the "Record Date"). Class A unitholders of the Operating Partnership as of the Record Date received the same distribution amount per unit on January 15, 2020. Approximately

$

1.74

per share of the special dividend was a long-term capital gain. The dividend was the result of gains from the transfer of a

45.4

%

common equity interest in the Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV(see Note 6 -

Investments in Partially Owned Entities

), the sale of our


%

interest in 330 Madison Avenue (see Note 6 -

Investments in Partially Owned Entities

) and other previously disclosed asset sales, partially offset by a tax deduction resulting from our former investment in Toys "R" Us (see Note 6 -

Investments in Partially Owned Entities

).

We have elected to treat certain consolidated subsidiaries, and may in the future elect to treat newly formed subsidiaries, as taxable REIT subsidiaries pursuant to an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code that became effective January 1, 2001. Taxable REIT subsidiaries may participate in non-real estate related activities and/or perform non-customary services for tenants and are subject to Federal and State income tax at regular corporate tax rates. Our 220 Central Park South condominium project is held through a taxable REIT subsidiary.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues primarily consist of rental revenues and fee and other income. We operate in

two

reportable segments: New York and Other, with a significant portion of our revenues included in the New York segment.

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:

•

Rental revenues include revenues from the leasing of space at our properties to tenants, lease termination income, revenues from the Hotel Pennsylvania, trade shows and tenant services.

◦

Revenues from the leasing of space at our properties to tenants includes (i) lease components, including fixed and variable lease payments, and nonlease components which include reimbursement of common area maintenance expenses, and (ii) reimbursement of real estate taxes and insurance expenses. As lessor, we have elected to combine the lease and nonlease components of our operating lease agreements and account for the components as a single lease component in accordance with ASC 842. Lease revenues and reimbursement of common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance are presented in the following tables as "property rentals." Revenues derived from fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable period of the lease, together with renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. We commence rental revenue recognition when the underlying asset is available for use by the lessee. Revenue derived from the reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance expenses and common area maintenance expenses are generally recognized in the same period as the related expenses are incurred.

◦

Lease termination income is recognized immediately if a tenant vacates or is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shortened remaining lease term in accordance with ASC 842.

◦

Hotel revenue arising from the operation of Hotel Pennsylvania consists of room revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Room revenue is recognized when the rooms are made available for the guest, in accordance with ASC 842.

◦

Trade shows revenue arising from the operation of trade shows is primarily booth rentals. This revenue is recognized upon the occurrence of the trade shows when the trade show booths are made available for use by the exhibitors, in accordance with ASC 842.

◦

Tenant services revenue arises from sub-metered electric, elevator, trash removal and other services provided to tenants at their request. This revenue is recognized as the services are transferred in accordance with ASC Topic 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

("ASC 606").

•

Fee and other income includes management, leasing and other revenue arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities and includes Building Maintenance Services LLC (“BMS”) cleaning, engineering and security services. This revenue is recognized as the services are transferred in accordance with ASC 606.

Investments in Partially Owned Entities

Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV

On April 18, 2019 (the “Closing Date”), we entered into a transaction agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) with a group of institutional investors (the “Investors”). The Transaction Agreement provides for a series of transactions (collectively, the “Transaction”) pursuant to which (i) prior to the Closing Date, we contributed our interests in properties located at 640 Fifth Avenue, 655 Fifth Avenue, 666 Fifth Avenue, 689 Fifth Avenue, 697-703 Fifth Avenue, 1535 Broadway and 1540 Broadway (collectively, the “Properties”) to subsidiaries of a newly formed joint venture (“Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV”) and (ii) on the Closing Date, transferred a

48.5

%

common interest in Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV to the Investors. The

48.5

%

common interest in the joint venture represents an effective

47.2

%

interest in the Properties (of which

45.4

%

was transferred from Vornado). The Properties include approximately

489,000

square feet of retail space,

327,000

square feet of office space, signage associated with 1535 and 1540 Broadway, the parking garage at 1540 Broadway and the theater at 1535 Broadway.

We retained the remaining

51.5

%

common interest in Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV which represents an effective

51.0

%

interest in the Properties and an aggregate

$

1.828

billion

of preferred equity interests in certain of the properties. We also provided

$

500,000,000

of temporary preferred equity on 640 Fifth Avenue until May 23, 2019 when mortgage financing was completed. All of the preferred equity has an annual coupon of

4.25

%

for the first five years, increasing to

4.75

%

for the next five years and thereafter at a formulaic rate. It can be redeemed under certain conditions on a tax deferred basis.

Net cash proceeds from the Transaction were

$

1.179

billion

, after (i) deductions for the defeasance of a

$

390,000,000

mortgage loan on 666 Fifth Avenue and the repayment of a

mortgage loan on 655 Fifth Avenue, (ii) proceeds from a

$

500,000,000

mortgage loan on 640 Fifth Avenue, described below, (iii) approximately

used to purchase noncontrolling investors' interests and (iv) approximately

$

53,000,000

of transaction costs (including

$

17,000,000

of costs related to the defeasance of the 666 Fifth Avenue mortgage loan).

We continue to manage and lease the Properties. We share control with the Investors over major decisions of the joint venture, including decisions regarding leasing, operating and capital budgets, and refinancings. Accordingly, we no longer hold a controlling financial interest in the Properties which has been transferred to the joint venture. As a result, our investment in Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV is accounted for under the equity method from the date of transfer. The Transaction valued the Properties at

$

, the carrying amount of our investment in Alexander’s, excluding amounts owed to us, exceeds our share of the equity in the net assets of Alexander’s by approximately

$

38,838,000

. The majority of this basis difference resulted from the excess of our purchase price for the Alexander’s common stock acquired over the book value of Alexander’s net assets. Substantially all of this basis difference was allocated, based on our estimates of the fair values of Alexander’s assets and liabilities, to real estate (land and buildings). We are amortizing the basis difference related to the buildings into earnings as additional depreciation expense over their estimated useful lives. This depreciation is not material to our share of equity in Alexander’s net income. The basis difference related to the land will be recognized upon disposition of our investment.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests/Redeemable Partnership Units

Redeemable noncontrolling interests on Vornado’s consolidated balance sheets and redeemable partnership units on the consolidated balance sheets of the Operating Partnership are primarily comprised of Class A Operating Partnership units held by third parties and are recorded at the greater of their carrying amount or redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the value from period to period are charged to “additional capital” in Vornado’s consolidated statements of changes in equity and to “partners’ capital” on the consolidated balance sheets of the Operating Partnership. Class A units may be tendered for redemption to the Operating Partnership for cash; Vornado, at its option, may assume that obligation and pay the holder either cash or Vornado common shares on a one-for-one basis. Because the number of Vornado common shares outstanding at all times equals the number of Class A units owned by Vornado, the redemption value of each Class A unit is equivalent to the market value of one Vornado common share, and the quarterly distribution to a Class A unitholder is equal to the quarterly dividend paid to a Vornado common shareholder.

Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820 defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. The objective of fair value is to determine the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price).

ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels: Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities; Level 2 – observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3 – unobservable inputs that are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible, as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret Level 2 and 3 inputs in determining the fair value of our financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. Accordingly, our fair value estimates, which are made at the end of each reporting period, may be different than the amounts that may ultimately be realized upon sale or disposition of these assets.

The inputs on the previous page are subject to change based on changes in economic and market conditions and/or changes in use or timing of exit. Changes in discount rates and terminal capitalization rates result in increases or decreases in the fair values of these investments. The discount rates encompass, among other things, uncertainties in the valuation models with respect to terminal capitalization rates and the amount and timing of cash flows. Therefore, a change in the fair value of these investments resulting from a change in the terminal capitalization rate may be partially offset by a change in the discount rate. It is not possible for us to predict the effect of future economic or market conditions on our estimated fair values.

The quarterly reports provide net asset values on a fair value basis which are audited by independent public accounting firms on an annual basis. The period of time over which these underlying assets are expected to be liquidated is unknown. The third-party administrator does not adjust these values in determining our share of the net assets and we do not adjust these values when reported in our consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Measurements on a Nonrecurring Basis

Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value

Financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets include cash equivalents (primarily money market funds, which invest in obligations of the United States government), and our secured and unsecured debt. Estimates of the fair value of these instruments are determined by the standard practice of modeling the contractual cash flows required under the instrument and discounting them back to their present value at the appropriate current risk adjusted interest rate, which is provided by a third-party specialist. For floating rate debt, we use forward rates derived from observable market yield curves to project the expected cash flows we would be required to make under the instrument. The fair value of cash equivalents and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and unsecured term loan are classified as Level 1. The fair value of our secured debt and unsecured debt are classified as Level 2.

Derivatives and Hedging

We utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. We recognize the fair values of all derivatives in "other assets" or "other liabilities" on our consolidated balance sheets. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedge asset, liability, or firm commitment through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Reported net income and equity may increase or decrease prospectively, depending on future levels of interest rates and other variables affecting the fair values of derivative instruments and hedged items, but will have no effect on cash flows.

Stock-based Compensation

On May 16, 2019, our shareholders approved the 2019 Omnibus Share Plan (the “Plan"), which replaces the 2010 Omnibus Share Plan. Under the Plan, the Compensation Committee of Vornado's Board of Trustees (the "Committee") may grant incentive and non-qualified Vornado stock options, restricted stock, restricted Operating Partnership units ("OP units"), out-performance plan awards ("OPPs"), appreciation-only long-term incentive plan units (“AO LTIP Units”) and Performance Conditioned AO LTIP Units to certain of our employees and officers. Awards may be granted up to a maximum

5,500,000

shares, if all awards granted are Full Value awards, as defined in the Plan, and up to

11,000,000

shares, if all of the awards granted are Not Full Value Awards, as defined in the Plan. Full Value Awards are awards of securities, such as restricted shares, that, if all vesting requirements are met, do not require the payment of an exercise price or strike price to acquire the securities. Not Full Value Awards are awards of securities, such as options, that do require the payment of an exercise price or strike price. As of

December 31, 2019

, Vornado has approximately

5,207,000

shares available for future grants under the Plan, if all awards granted are Full Value Awards, as defined.

We account for all equity-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718,

Compensation - Stock Compensation

.

Below is a summary of our stock-based compensation expense, a component of "general and administrative" expense on our consolidated statements of income.

Stock-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2019 included

$

16,211,000

from the accelerated vesting of previously issued OP units and Vornado restricted stock due to the removal of the time-based vesting requirement for participants who have reached 65 years of age. The right to sell such awards remains subject to original terms of grant. The increase in expense in the first quarter of 2019 was partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense of

$

2,578,000

in each of the second, third and fourth quarter of 2019 and will be completely offset by lower stock-based compensation expense of

$

8,477,000

thereafter.

Stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 also includes

$

8,143,000

for OP units granted outside of the Plan to an executive officer in connection with his employment in reliance on the employment inducement exception to shareholder approval provided under the New York Stock Exchange Listing Rule 303A.08; and

$

2,304,000

for the year ended

December 31, 2019

Stock-based Compensation

OPPs

OPPs are multi-year, performance-based equity compensation plans under which participants have the opportunity to earn a class of units (“OPP units”) of the Operating Partnership if, and only if, Vornado outperforms a predetermined total shareholder return (“TSR”) and/or outperform the market with respect to a relative TSR during the

three

-year performance period (the “Performance Period”) as described below. OPP units, if earned, become convertible into Class A units of the Operating Partnership (and ultimately into Vornado common shares) following vesting.

Awards under the 2018 OPP may be earned if Vornado (i) achieves a TSR level greater than


%

over the Performance Period (the “Absolute Component”) and/or (ii) achieves a TSR above a benchmark weighted index comprised of


%

of the SNL US Office REIT Index and


%

of the SNL US Retail Index over the Performance Period (the “Relative Component”).

The value of awards under the Relative Component and Absolute Component will be calculated separately and will each be subject to an aggregate

$

35,000,000

maximum award cap for all participants. The

two

components will be added together to determine the aggregate award size, which shall also be subject to the aggregate

$

35,000,000

maximum award cap for all participants. In the event awards are earned under the Absolute Component, but Vornado underperforms the index by more than 200 basis points per annum over the Performance Period (600 basis points over the

three years

), the amount earned under the Absolute Component will be reduced (and potentially fully negated) based on the degree by which the index exceeds Vornado’s TSR. In the event these awards are earned under the Relative Component, but Vornado fails to achieve a TSR of at least


%

per annum, awards earned under the Relative Component will be reduced on a ratable sliding scale based on Vornado’s absolute TSR performance, with awards earned under the Relative Component being reduced by a maximum of


%

in the event Vornado’s TSR during the applicable measurement period is


%

or negative.

If the designated performance objectives are achieved, awards under the 2018 OPP will vest ratably in each of years three, four and five. In addition, all of Vornado’s Named Executive Officers (as defined in Vornado’s Proxy Statement filed on Schedule 14A with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 5, 2019) are required to hold any earned and vested awards for one year following each such vesting date. Dividends on awards granted under the 2018 OPP accrue during the Performance Period and are paid to participants if awards are ultimately earned based on the achievement of the designated performance objectives.

Performance Conditioned AOLTIP Units

On January 14, 2019, the Committee approved the issuance of performance conditioned appreciation-only long-term incentive plan units ("Performance Conditioned AO LTIP Units") pursuant to the 2010 Omnibus Share Plan to our named executive officers ("NEOs") in our 2019 proxy statement. Performance Conditioned AO LTIP Units are AO LTIP Units that require the achievement of certain performance conditions by a specified date or they are forfeited. The performance-based condition is met if Vornado common shares trade at or above


%

of the

$

64.48

grant price per share for any


consecutive days on or before the fourth anniversary following the date of grant. If the performance conditions are not met, the awards are forfeited. If the performance conditions are met, once vested, the awards may be converted into Class A Operating Partnership units in the same manner as AO LTIP Units until ten years from the date of grant.

The fair value of the Performance Conditioned AO LTIP Units on the date of grant was

$

8,983,000

, of which

$

7,481,000

was immediately expensed due to the acceleration of vesting for employees who are retirement eligible. The remaining

$

1,502,000

is being amortized into expense over a four-year period from the date of grant using a graded vesting attribution model.

AO LTIP Units

AO LTIP Units are a class of partnership interests in the Operating Partnership that are intended to qualify as “profits interests” for federal income tax purposes and generally only allow the recipient to realize value to the extent the fair market value of a Vornado common share exceeds the threshold level set at the time the AO LTIP Units are granted, subject to any vesting conditions applicable to the award. The threshold level is intended to be equal to


%

of the then fair market value of a Vornado common share on the date of grant. The value of vested AO LTIP Units is realized through conversion of the AO LTIP Units into Class A Operating Partnership units. The number of Class A Units into which vested AO LTIP Units may be converted is determined based on the quotient of (i) the excess of the conversion value on the conversion date over the threshold value designated at the time the AO LTIP Unit was granted, divided by (ii) the conversion value on the conversion date. The “conversion value” is the value of a Vornado common share on the conversion date multiplied by the Conversion Factor as defined in the Partnership Agreement, which is currently one. AO LTIP Units have a term of 10 years from the grant date. Each holder will generally receive special income allocations in respect of an AO LTIP Unit equal to


%

(or such other percentage specified in the applicable award agreement) of the income allocated in respect of a Class A Unit. Upon conversion of AO LTIP Units to Class A Units, holders will be entitled to receive in respect of each such AO LTIP Unit, on a per unit basis, a special distribution equal to


%

(or such other percentage specified in the applicable award agreement) of the distributions received by a holder of an equivalent number of Class A Units during the period from the grant date of the AO LTIP Units through the date of conversion.

608 Fifth Avenue

During the second quarter of 2019, Arcadia Group US Ltd ("Arcadia Group"), the operator of Topshop, our retail tenant at 608 Fifth Avenue, filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the United States. On June 28, 2019, Arcadia Group closed all of its stores in the United States. 608 Fifth Avenue is subject to a land and building lease which expires in 2033. The non-recourse lease calls for fixed lease payments through the term, plus payments for real estate taxes, insurance and operating expenses. Consequently, based on projected future cash flows we concluded that the excess of the carrying amount of the property, which includes our right-of-use asset, over our estimate of fair value was not recoverable resulting in a write down to zero. Our estimate of fair value of the property was derived from a discounted cash flow model using a

Leases

As lessor

We lease space to tenants under operating leases. Most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base rent payable monthly in advance. Office building leases generally require tenants to reimburse us for operating costs and real estate taxes above their base year costs. Certain leases provide for pass-through to tenants for their share of real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance. Certain leases also require additional variable rent payments based on a percentage of the tenants’ sales. None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended

December 31, 2019

, 2018 and 2017. We have elected to account for lease revenues (including base and variable rent) and the reimbursement of common area maintenance expenses as a single lease component recorded as "rental revenues" on our consolidated statements of income.

Under ASC 842, we assess on an individual lease basis whether it is probable that we will collect the future lease payments. We consider the tenant's payment history and current credit status when assessing collectability. When collectability is not deemed probable we write-off the tenant's receivables, including straight-line rent receivables, and limit lease income to cash received. Changes to the collectability of our operating leases are recorded as adjustments to "rental revenues" on our consolidated statements of income, which resulted in a decrease in income of

$

17,237,000

for the year ended

December 31, 2019

. As a result, there is

no

allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2019. Prior to the adoption of ASC 842, we maintained an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on receivables under our lease agreements, including receivables arising from the straight-lining of rent.

December 31, 2019

, our ROU assets and lease liabilities were

$

379,546,000

and

$

498,254,000

, respectively.

The discount rate applied to measure each ROU asset and lease liability is based on our incremental borrowing rate ("IBR"). We consider the general economic environment and our credit rating and factor in various financing and asset specific adjustments to ensure the IBR is appropriate to the intended use of the underlying lease. As we did not elect to apply hindsight, lease term assumptions determined under ASC 840 were carried forward and applied in calculating the lease liabilities recorded under ASC 842. Certain of our ground leases offer renewal options which we assess against relevant economic factors to determine whether we are reasonably certain of exercising or not exercising the option. Lease payments associated with renewal periods that we are reasonably certain will be exercised are included in the measurement of the corresponding lease liability and ROU asset.

The following table sets forth information related to the measurement of our lease liabilities as of

Multiemployer Benefit Plans

Our subsidiaries make contributions to certain multiemployer defined benefit plans (“Multiemployer Pension Plans”) and health plans (“Multiemployer Health Plans”) for our union represented employees, pursuant to the respective collective bargaining agreements.

Multiemployer Pension Plans

Multiemployer Pension Plans differ from single-employer pension plans in that (i) contributions to multiemployer plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers and (ii) if other participating employers fail to make their contributions, each of our participating subsidiaries may be required to bear its then pro rata share of unfunded obligations. If a participating subsidiary withdraws from a plan in which it participates, it may be subject to a withdrawal liability. As of

December 31, 2019

Commitments and Contingencies

Insurance

For our properties except the Farley Office and Retail Building, we maintain general liability insurance with limits of

$

300,000,000

per occurrence and per property, and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of

$

2.0

billion

per occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as flood and earthquake. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of

$

350,000,000

per occurrence and in the aggregate, subject to a deductible in the amount of


%

of the value of the affected property. We maintain coverage for certified terrorism acts with limits of

$

6.0

billion

per occurrence and in the aggregate (as listed below),

$

1.2

billion

for non-certified acts of terrorism, and

$

5.0

billion

per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) terrorism events, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended to date and which has been extended through December 2027.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism including NBCR acts. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of

$

1,430,413

and


%

of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining portion of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC.

For the Farley Office and Retail Building, we maintain general liability insurance with limits of

$

100,000,000

per occurrence, and builder’s risk insurance including coverage for existing property and development activities of

$

2.8

billion

per occurrence and in the aggregate. We maintain coverage for certified and non-certified terrorism acts with limits of

$

1.0

billion

per occurrence and in the aggregate.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism and other events. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We are responsible for uninsured losses and for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters is not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

In July 2018, we leased

78,000

square feet at 345 Montgomery Street in San Francisco, CA, to a subsidiary of Regus PLC, for an initial term of


years

. The obligations under the lease were guaranteed by Regus PLC in an amount of up to

$

90,000,000

. The tenant purported to terminate the lease prior to space delivery. We commenced a suit on October 23, 2019 seeking to enforce the lease and the guarantee.

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us, except for the mortgage loans secured by 640 Fifth Avenue, 7 West 34th Street and 435 Seventh Avenue, which we guaranteed and therefore are part of our tax basis. In certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space. These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans. In addition, we have guaranteed the rent and payments in lieu of real estate taxes due to ESD, an entity of New York State, for the Farley Office and Retail Building. As of

December 31, 2019

, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately

$

1,524,000,000

.

As of

December 31, 2019

,

$

15,880,000

of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our unsecured revolving credit facilities. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

Segment Information

We operate in

two

reportable segments, New York and Other, which is based on how we manage our business.

Net operating income ("NOI") at share represents total revenues less operating expenses including our share of partially owned entities.

NOI at share - cash basis represents NOI at share adjusted to exclude straight-line rental income and expense, amortization of acquired below and above market leases, net and other non-cash adjustments. We consider NOI at share - cash basis to be the primary non-GAAP financial measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on NOI at share - cash basis, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. NOI at share and NOI at share - cash basis should not be considered alternatives to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Vornado Realty Trust and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control -

Integrated Framework (2013)

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013

) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, of the Company and our report dated February 18, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
