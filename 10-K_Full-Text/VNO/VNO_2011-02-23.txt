The Company

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”).  Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 93.2% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2010.  All references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership.

As of December 31, 2010, we own:

Office Properties

:

(i)

all or portions of 28 properties aggregating 17.4 million square feet in the New York City metropolitan area (primarily Manhattan);

(ii)         all or portions of 82 properties aggregating 21.1 million square feet in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area;

7 stores in the United States and 732 stores internationally;

(x)         a 26.2% equity interest in LNR Property Corporation, an industry leading servicer and special servicer of commercial mortgage loans and CMBS, and a diversified real estate, investment and finance company;

(xi)        a 36.4% interest in our real estate investment fund in which we are the general partner and investment manager with aggregate equity commitments of $550 million, of which we committed $200 million; and

(xii)       other real estate and investments, including marketable securities and mezzanine loans on real estate.


Objectives and Strategy

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder
value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our
investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through:

·

Maintaining a superior team of operating and
investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

·

Investing in properties in select markets, such as
New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high
likelihood of capital appreciation;

·

Acquiring quality properties at a discount to
replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher
rents;

·

Investing in retail properties in select
under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;

·

Developing and redeveloping our existing properties
to increase returns and maximize value; and

·

Investing in operating companies that have a
significant real estate component.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and
investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales
and by accessing the public and private capital markets.  We may also offer
Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange
for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other
securities in the future.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

Substantially
all businesses, including ours, were negatively affected by the 2008/2009
economic recession and illiquidity and volatility in the capital and financial
markets.  Although there are signs of an economic recovery and greater
stability in the capital and financial markets, it is not possible for us to
predict whether these trends will continue in the future or quantify the impact
of these or any other trends on our financial results.

ACQUISITIONS and investments

Vornado Capital Partners, L.P. and Vornado Capital
Partners Parallel, L.P. (the “Fund”)

On July 6, 2010,
we completed an initial closing of the Fund with aggregate equity commitments of
$550,000,000, of which we committed $200,000,000.  We expect to close on an
additional $250,000,000 of equity commitments in the first quarter of
2011.  We are the general partner and investment manager of the Fund and it
is our exclusive investment vehicle during the three-year investment period for
all investments that fit within the Fund’s investment parameters, including
debt, equity and other interests in real estate, and excluding (i) investments
in vacant land and ground-up development; (ii) investments acquired by merger or
primarily for our securities or properties; (iii) properties which can be
combined with or relate to our existing properties; (iv) securities of
commercial mortgage loan servicers and investments derived from any such
investments; (v) noncontrolling interests in equity and debt securities; and
(vi) investments located outside of North America.   The Fund has a
term of eight years.  We consolidate the accounts of the Fund into our
consolidated financial statements.  In 2010, we incurred $6,482,000 for
organization costs of the Fund, net of the Fund’s reimbursement to us, which are
included in “general and administrative” expenses on our consolidated statement
of income.

The Fund is
accounted for under the AICPA Investment Company Guide and its investments are
reported on its balance sheet at fair value, with changes in value each period
recognized in earnings.  As of December 31, 2010, the Fund received
$146,789,000 of capital from partners, including $53,378,000 from us. 
During the second half of 2010, the Fund made four investments aggregating
approximately $145,000,000 and reimbursed us for $1,500,000 of organization
costs.


ACQUISITIONS and investments – continued

Investment in J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (“J.C.
Penney”) (NYSE: JCP)

We own an
economic interest in 23,400,000 J.C. Penney common shares, or 9.9% of J.C.
Penney’s outstanding common shares.  Below are the details of our
investment.

We own
18,584,010 common shares at an average price of $25.70 per share, or
$477,678,000 in the aggregate.  These shares, which have an aggregate fair
value of $600,449,000 at December 31, 2010, are included in marketable equity
securities on our consolidated balance sheet and are classified as “available
for sale.”  Of these shares, 15,500,000 were acquired through the exercise
of a call option that originated on September 28, 2010 and settled on November
9, 2010.  During the period in which the call option was outstanding and
classified as a derivative instrument, we recognized $112,537,000 of income from
the mark-to-market of the underlying common shares, which is included in
“interest and other investment income (loss), net” on our consolidated statement
of income.  During the period from November 10 through December 31, 2010,
we recognized $10,234,000 from the mark-to-market of the common shares
classified as available-for-sale, which is included in “accumulated other
comprehensive income” (a component of shareholders’ equity on our consolidated
balance sheet).

We also own an
economic interest in 4,815,990 common shares through a forward contract executed
on October 7, 2010, at a weighted average strike price of $28.65 per share, or
$137,989,000 in the aggregate.  The contract may be settled, at our
election, in cash or common shares, in whole or in part, at any time prior to
October 9, 2012.  The counterparty may accelerate settlement, in whole or
in part, upon one year’s notice to us.  The strike price per share
increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 80 basis points and decreases for
dividends received on the shares.  The contract is a derivative instrument
that does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  Mark-to-market
adjustments on the underlying common shares are recognized in “interest and
other investment income (loss), net” on our consolidated statement of
income.  During the period from October 7, 2010 through December 31, 2010,
we recognized $17,616,000 of income from the mark-to-market of this position,
based on J.C. Penney’s closing share price of $32.31 per share at December 31,
2010.

As of December
31, 2010, the aggregate economic net gain on our investment in J.C. Penney was
$140,387,000, based on J.C. Penney’s closing share price of $32.31 per share and
our weighted average cost of $26.31 per share.

Investment in LNR Property Corporation
(“LNR”)

On July 29,
2010, as a part of LNR’s recapitalization, we acquired a 26.2% equity interest
in LNR for $116,000,000 in cash and conversion into equity of our $15,000,000
mezzanine loan (the then current carrying amount) made to LNR’s parent, Riley
Holdco Corp.  The recapitalization involved an infusion of a total of
$417,000,000 in new cash equity and the reduction of LNR’s total debt to
$425,000,000 from $1.3 billion, excluding liabilities related to the
consolidated CMBS and CDO trusts described below.  We account for our
equity interest in LNR under the equity method on a one-quarter lag basis.

LNR consolidates
certain commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) and Collateralized Debt
Obligation (“CDO”) trusts for which it is the primary beneficiary.  The
assets of these trusts (primarily commercial mortgage loans), which aggregate
approximately $142 billion as of September 30, 2010, are the sole source of
repayment of the related liabilities, which are non-recourse to LNR and its
equity holders, including us.  Changes in the fair value of these assets
each period are offset by changes in the fair value of the related liabilities
through LNR’s consolidated income statement.

510 Fifth
Avenue

On October 8,
2010, we acquired 510 Fifth Avenue, a 59,000 square foot retail property located
at 43

rd

Street and Fifth Avenue in New York, for $57,000,000,
comprised of $24,700,000 in cash and $32,300,000 of existing debt.

San Jose, California

On October 15,
2010, we acquired the 55% interest that we did not already own of a 646,000
square foot retail property located in San Jose, California, for $97,000,000,
consisting of $27,000,000 in cash and $70,000,000 of existing debt.

Atlantic City, New Jersey

On November 4,
2010, we acquired 11.3 acres of the land under a portion of the Borgata Hotel
and Casino complex for $83,000,000 in cash.  The land is leased to the
partnership that controls the Borgata Hotel and Casino complex through December
2070.  In January 2011, we completed a 10-year $60,000,000 financing of
this land.  The loan has a fixed interest rate of 5.14% and amortizes
beginning in the third year, based on a 30-year schedule.


Dispositions

On October 20, 2010, we sold a 45% ownership interest in 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue (the Warner Building) and 1101 17

th

Street, for $236,700,000, comprised of $91,000,000 in cash and the assumption of existing mortgage debt.  We retained the remaining 55% ownership interest and continue to manage and lease the properties.  Based on the Warner Building’s implied fair value of $445,000,000, we recognized a net gain of $54,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The gain on 1101 17

th

Street, based on an implied fair value of $81,000,000, will be recognized when we monetize our investment.

On January 12, 2011, we sold 1140 Connecticut Avenue and contracted to sell 1227 25

th

Street, subject to customary closing conditions, for an aggregate price of $127,000,000.  We will retain net proceeds of approximately $107,000,000, after repaying an existing mortgage and recognize a net gain of approximately $44,000,000 in the first quarter of 2011.

In March 2010, we ceased making debt service payments on the mortgage loan secured by the High Point Complex in North Carolina as a result of insufficient cash flow and the loan went into default.  In November 2010, the property was placed in receivership.  While the receivership process is inherently lengthy, we anticipate that the property will be sold in the first half of 2011, at which time the assets and liabilities will be removed from our consolidated balance sheet and we will recognize a net gain of approximately $80,000,000.

Financing Activities

On February 11, 2011, we completed a $425,000,000 refinancing of Two Penn Plaza, a 1.6 million square foot Manhattan office building.  The seven-year loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%, which was swapped for the term of the loan to a fixed rate of 5.13%.  The loan amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the fourth year.  We retained net proceeds of approximately $139,000,000 after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.

On February 10, 2011, we completed a $150,000,000 financing of 2121 Crystal Drive, a 506,000 square foot office building located in Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia.  The 12-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 5.51% and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in third year.  This property was previously unencumbered.

On January 10, 2011, we completed a $75,000,000 financing of North Bergen (Tonnelle Avenue), a 410,000 square foot strip shopping center.  The seven-year fixed rate loan bears interest rate at 4.59%, provides for interest only payments during the first five years of the term and amortizes based on a 25-year schedule. This property was previously unencumbered.

In December 2010, we acquired the mortgage loan secured by the Springfield Mall, located in Fairfax County, Virginia for $115,000,000 in cash.  The loan had an outstanding balance of $171,500,000.  In a separate transaction, we acquired our partner’s interest in the partnership that owns the mall in exchange for $25,000,000 in Operating Partnership units.  These transactions resulted in a $102,932,000 net gain on early extinguishment of debt.

In August 2010, we sold $660,000,000 of 10-year mortgage notes in a single issuer securitization.  The notes are comprised of a $600,000,000 fixed rate component and a $60,000,000 variable rate component and are cross-collateralized by 40 of our strip shopping centers.  The $600,000,000 fixed rate portion bears interest at an initial rate of 4.18% and a weighted average rate of 4.31% over the 10-year term and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule.  The variable rate portion bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.36%, with a 1% floor (2.36% at December 31, 2010).

In March 2010, we completed a public offering of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due April 1, 2015 and retained net proceeds of approximately $496,000,000.  The notes were sold at 99.834% of their face amount to yield 4.287%.  The notes can be redeemed without penalty beginning January 1, 2015.

In 2010, through open market repurchases and tender offers, we purchased $270,491,000 aggregate face amount ($264,476,000 aggregate carrying amount) of our convertible senior debentures and $17,000,000 aggregate face amount ($16,981,000 aggregate carrying amount) of our senior unsecured notes for $274,857,000 and $17,382,000 in cash, respectively, resulting in a net loss of $10,381,000 and $401,000, respectively.


Development and Redevelopment
Projects

We expended
$156,775,000 in 2010 to complete development projects.

On
October 1, 2010, Arlington County adopted a new Sector Plan for Crystal City
that provides for additional density and increased building heights which would
permit us to grow our assets in Crystal City from 8.0 million square
feet currently to as much as 11.5 million square feet

.

During 2010, we
entered into agreements with Cuyahoga County, Ohio (the “County”) to develop and
operate the Cleveland Medical Mart and Convention Center (the “Facility”), a
1,000,000 square foot showroom, trade show and conference center in Cleveland’s
central business district.  The County will fund the development of the
Facility, using proceeds from the issuance of general obligation bonds and other
sources, up to the development budget of $465,000,000 and maintain effective
control of the property.  During the 17-year development and operating
period, we will receive net settled payments of approximately $10,000,000 per
year, which is net of our $36,000,000 annual obligation to the County.  Our
obligation has been pledged by the County to the bondholders, but is payable by
us only to the extent that we first receive at least an equal payment from the
County.  We engaged a contractor to construct the Facility pursuant to a
guaranteed maximum price contract.  Although we are ultimately responsible
for cost overruns, the contractor is responsible for all costs incurred in
excess of its contract and has provided a completion guaranty. 
Construction of the Facility is expected to be completed in 2013. 
Subsequent thereto, we are required to fund $11,500,000, primarily for tenant
improvements, are responsible for all operating expenses and are entitled to the
net operating income, if any, of the Facility.  The County may terminate
the operating agreement five years from the completion of development and
periodically thereafter, if we fail to achieve certain performance
thresholds.  We plan to account for these agreements using criteria set
forth in ASC 605-25,

Multiple-Element Arrangements,

as we are
providing development, marketing, leasing, and other property management related
services over the 17-year term.  We plan to recognize development fees
using the percentage of completion method of accounting.

We are also
evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities for which final
plans, budgeted costs and financing have yet to be determined.  These
projects include the Springfield Mall in Springfield, Virginia and the Hotel
Pennsylvania and 220 Central Park South in Manhattan.

There can be no
assurance that any of our development projects will commence, or if commenced,
be completed on schedule or within budget.

Segment Data

We operate in the following business segments: New
York Office Properties, Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties,
Merchandise Mart Properties and Toys “R” Us.  Financial information related
to these business segments for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008
is set forth in Note 22 – Segment Information to our consolidated financial
statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The Merchandise Mart
Properties segment has trade show operations in Canada and Switzerland. The Toys
segment has 732 locations internationally.

SEASONALITY

Our revenues and expenses are subject to
seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and
funds from operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the current quarter
to the previous quarter. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically,
Toys’ fourth quarter net income, which we record on a one-quarter lag basis in
our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. The
New York and Washington, DC Office Properties and Merchandise Mart Properties
segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and
third quarters of the year. The Merchandise Mart Properties segment has also
experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to
major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail Properties segment
revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of
percentage rental income.


tenants ACCOUNTING FOR over 10% of revenues

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Certain Activities

We are not required to base our acquisitions and investments on specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for long‑term investment; however, it is possible that properties in the portfolio may be sold as circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property or property type. While we may seek the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by our Board of Trustees without the vote of shareholders.

Employees

As of December 31, 2010, we have approximately 4,780 employees, of which 317 are corporate staff. The New York Office Properties segment has 126 employees and an additional 2,680 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering services primarily to our New York Office and Washington, DC Office properties. The Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties and Merchandise Mart Properties segments have 400, 176 and 576 employees, respectively, and the Hotel Pennsylvania has 505 employees. The foregoing does not include employees of partially owned entities, including Toys or Alexander’s, of which we own 32.7% and 32.4%, respectively.

principal executive offices

ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS

Material factors that may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition are summarized below.

Real Estate Investments’ Value and Income Fluctuate Due to Various Factors.

The value of real estate fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business. These conditions may also adversely impact our revenues and cash flows.

The factors that affect the value of our real estate investments include, among other things:

·

national, regional and local economic conditions;

·

competition from other available space;

·

local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area;

·

how well we manage our properties;

·

the development and/or redevelopment of our properties;

·

changes in market rental rates;

·

the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;

·

whether we are able to pass all or portions of any increases in operating costs through to tenants;

·

changes in real estate taxes and other expenses;

·

whether tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property attractive;

·

the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;

·

availability of financing on acceptable terms or at all;

·

fluctuations in interest rates;

·

our ability to obtain adequate insurance;

·

changes in zoning laws and taxation;

·

government regulation;

·

consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the United States;

·

potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations;

·

natural disasters;

·

general competitive factors; and

·

climate changes.

The rents we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors. If rental revenues and/or occupancy levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available to pay indebtedness and for distribution to shareholders. In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs generally do not decline when the related rents decline.

Capital markets and economic conditions can materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the value of our debt and equity securities.

There are many factors that can affect the value of our debt and equity securities, including the state of the capital markets and the economy, which have recently negatively affected substantially all businesses, including ours.  Demand for office and retail space may decline nationwide as it did in 2008 and 2009, due to bankruptcies, downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting.  The cost and availability of credit may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads, which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants.  Our inability or the inability of our tenants to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the va
lue of our debt and equity securities.

Real estate is a competitive business.

Our business segments – New York Office Properties, Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties, Merchandise Mart Properties and Toys – operate in a highly competitive environment. We have a large concentration of properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area. We compete with a large number of property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of cap
ital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulation, legislation and population trends.


We depend on leasing space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from tenants who may not be able to pay.

Our financial results depend significantly on leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms. In addition, because a majority of our income comes from renting of real property, our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and funds available for distribution to shareholders will decrease if a significant number of our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain occupancy levels on favorable terms. If a tenant does not pay its rent, we may not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs.  During periods of economic adversity, there may be an increase in the number of tenants that cannot pay their rent and an increase in vacancy rates.

Bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenue, net income and available cash.

From time to time, some of our tenants have declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the future. In the case of our shopping centers, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could cause us to suffer lower revenues and operational difficulties, including leasing the remainder of the property. As a result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could result in decreased revenue, net income and funds available for the payment of indebtedness or for distribution to shareholders.

We may incur costs to comply with environmental laws.

Our operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contaminati
on may impair our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and underground storage tanks are also regulated by federal and state laws. We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances
 or tanks or related claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure to contamination at or from our properties.

Each of our properties has been subject to varying degrees of environmental assessment. The environmental assessments did not, as of this date, reveal any environmental condition material to our business. However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, discovery of additional sites, human exposure to the contamination or changes in clean-up or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us.

Inflation or deflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Although neither inflation nor deflation has materially impacted our operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a pronounced negative impact on our mortgages and interest rates and general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents.  Inflation could also have an adverse effect on consumer spending which could impact our tenants’ sales and, in turn, our percentage rents, where applicable.  Conversely, deflation could lead to downward pressure on rents and other sources of income.  In addition, we own residential properties which are leased to tenants with one-year lease terms.  Because these are short-term leases, declines in market rents will impact our residential properties faster than if the leases were for longer terms.


Some of our
potential losses may not be covered by insurance.

We maintain general liability insurance with limits
of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all risk property and rental value insurance
with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, including coverage for terrorist
acts, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods.  Our California
properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $150,000,000 per
occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the
affected property, up to a $150,000,000 annual aggregate.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our
wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a
portion of our earthquake insurance coverage and as a direct insurer for
coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and
radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by TRIPRA.  Coverage for acts of
terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance
companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC.  Our
coverage for NBCR losses is up to $2 billion per occurrence, for which PPIC is
responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and 15% of the balance of a covered
loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of a
covered loss.  We are ultimately responsible for any loss borne by
PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance
market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However,
we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable
terms in future policy years.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans
secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes,
exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving
credit agreements, contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain
insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for
purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount
of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on
greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our
ability to finance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Because we
operate a hotel, we face the risks associated with the hospitality
industry.

We own and operate the Hotel Pennsylvania in New
York City. The following factors, among others, are common to the hotel industry
and may reduce the revenues generated by the hotel, which would reduce cash
available for distribution to our shareholders:

·

our hotel competes for guests with other hotels, a
number of which have greater marketing and financial resources;

·

if there is an increase in operating costs
resulting from inflation and other factors, we may not be able to offset such
increase by increasing room rates;

·

our hotel is subject to the fluctuating and
seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism;

·

our hotel is subject to general and local economic
and social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, including
war and terrorism; and

·

physical condition, which may require substantial
additional capital.

Because of the
ownership structure of the Hotel Pennsylvania, we face potential adverse effects
from changes to the applicable tax laws.

Under the Internal Revenue Code, REITs like us are
not allowed to operate hotels directly or indirectly. Accordingly, we lease the
Hotel Pennsylvania to our taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”). While the TRS
structure allows the economic benefits of ownership to flow to us, the TRS is
subject to tax on its income from the operations of the hotel at the federal and
state level. In addition, the TRS is subject to detailed tax regulations that
affect how it may be capitalized and operated. If the tax laws applicable to a
TRS are modified, we may be forced to modify the structure for owning the hotel,
and such changes may adversely affect the cash flows from the hotel. In
addition, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department
and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, and we cannot
predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations,
interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any such actions may prospectively
or retroactively modify the tax treatment of the TRS and, therefore, may
adversely affect our after-tax returns from the hotel.


Compliance or
failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety
regulations and requirements could result in substantial
costs.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”)
generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, meet certain
federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.
Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government
or the award of damages to private litigants. From time to time persons have
asserted claims against us with respect to some of our properties under the ADA,
but to date such claims have not resulted in any material expense or liability.
If, under the ADA, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital
expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access
barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to
shareholders.

Our properties are subject to various federal,
state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life
safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could
incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing
requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will
require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow
and results of operations.

Our business and operations would suffer in the
event of system failures.

Despite system redundancy, the implementation of
security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal
information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any
number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy
blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication
failures.  Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our
operations could result in a material disruption to our business.  We may
also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such
disruptions.

We face risks associated with our tenants being
designated “Prohibited Persons” by the Office of Foreign Assets
Control.

Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws,
the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the
Treasury (“OFAC”) maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who
are otherwise blocked or banned (“Prohibited Persons”) from conducting business
or engaging in transactions in the United States.  Our leases, loans and
other agreements may require us to comply with OFAC requirements.  If a
tenant or other party with whom we conduct business is placed on the OFAC list
we may be required to terminate the lease or other agreement.  Any such
termination could result in a loss of revenue or otherwise negatively affect our
financial results and cash flows.


Our Investments Are Concentrated in the New York CITY METROPOLITAN AREA and Washington, DC / NORTHERN VIRGINIA Area. Circumstances Affecting These Areas Generally Could Adversely Affect Our Business.

A significant portion of our properties are located in the New York City / New Jersey metropolitan area and Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area and are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent to those areas.

During 2010, approximately 74% of our EBITDA, excluding items that affect comparability, came from properties located in the New York City / New Jersey metropolitan areas and the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area. We may continue to concentrate a significant portion of our future acquisitions in these areas or in other geographic real estate markets in the United States or abroad. Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact these markets in either the short or long term. Declines in the economy or a decline in the real estate markets in these areas could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties. The factors affecting economic conditions in these regions include:

·

financial performance and productivity of the publishing, advertising, financial, technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries;

·

space needs of the United States Government, including the effect of a deficit reduction plan and/or base closures and repositioning under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 2005, as amended;

·

business layoffs or downsizing;

·

industry slowdowns;

·

relocations of businesses;

·

changing demographics;

·

increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places;

·

infrastructure quality; and

·

any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.

It is impossible for us to assess the future effects of trends in the economic and investment climates of the geographic areas in which we concentrate, and more generally of the United States, or the real estate markets in these areas.  Local, national or global economic downturns, would negatively affect our businesses and profitability.

Terrorist attacks, such as those of September 11, 2001 in New York City and the Washington, DC area, may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.

We have significant investments in large metropolitan areas, including the New York, Washington, DC, Chicago, Boston and San Francisco metropolitan areas. In the aftermath of a terrorist attack, tenants in these areas may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in these areas. This, in turn, would trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these areas, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease space on less favorable terms. As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues and cash flows could decline materially.

We May Acquire or Sell Assets or Entities or Develop Properties. Our Failure or Inability to Consummate These Transactions or Manage the Results of These Transactions Could Adversely Affect Our Operations and Financial Results.

We have grown rapidly since 1999 through acquisitions. We may not be able to maintain this rapid growth and our failure to do so could adversely affect our stock price.

We have experienced rapid growth since 1999, increasing our total assets from approximately $5.5 billion at December 31, 1999 to approximately $20.5 billion at December 31, 2010. We may not be able to maintain a similar rate of growth in the future or manage growth effectively. Our failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the amount of cash available for distributions to shareholders.


We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks.

We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategy. We may not, however, succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. In addition, we may face competition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. When we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover costs of acquisition or development and operations.  Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management’s attention. Acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge
 may result in weaker than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated. Furthermore, acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware at the time of acquisition. Development of our existing properties presents similar risks.

From time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, one or more material acquisitions.  The announcement of such a material acquisition may result in a rapid and significant decline in the price of our common shares.

We are continuously looking at material transactions that we will believe will maximize shareholder value.  However, an announcement by us of one or more significant acquisitions could result in a quick and significant decline in the price of our common shares and convertible and exchangeable securities.

It may be difficult to buy and sell real estate quickly, which may limit our flexibility.

Real estate investments are relatively difficult to buy and sell quickly. Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.

We may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the debt associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs.

As part of an acquisition of a property, or a portfolio of properties, we may agree, and in the past have agreed, not to dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness for a long-term period, unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the seller. These agreements could result in us holding on to properties that we would otherwise sell and not pay down or refinance.

From time to time we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control. Some of these companies operate in industries that differ from our current operations, with different risks than investing in real estate.

From time to time we make debt or equity investments in other companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control. These investments include but are not limited to, Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”), Toys “R” Us (“Toys”), Lexington Realty Trust (“Lexington”), J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (“J.C. Penney”), LNR Property Corporation (“LNR”) and other equity and mezzanine investments. Although these businesses generally have a significant real estate component, some of them operate in businesses that are different from our primary lines of business including, without limitation, operating or managing toy stores and department stores. Consequently, investments in these businesses, among other risks, subjects us to the operating and fina
ncial risks of industries other than real estate and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses. From time to time we may make additional investments in or acquire other entities that may subject us to similar risks. Investments in entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures, present additional risks such as having differing objectives than our partners or the entities in which we invest, or becoming involved in disputes, or competing with those persons. In addition, we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may adversely affect us.


We are subject to risks that affect the general retail environment.

A substantial portion of our properties are in the retail shopping center real estate market and we have a significant investment in retailers such as Toys and J.C. Penney. This means that we are subject to factors that affect the retail environment generally, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, the threat of terrorism and increasing competition from discount retailers, outlet malls, retail websites and catalog companies. These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants and the retailers in which we hold an investment and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers, and in turn, adversely affect us.

Our investment in Toys subjects us to risks that are different from our other lines of business and may result in increased seasonality and volatility in our reported earnings.

Because Toys is a retailer, its operations subject us to the risks of a retail company that are different than those presented by our other lines of business. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. In addition, our fiscal year ends on December 31 whereas, as is common for retailers, Toys’ fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. Therefore, we record our pro-rata share of Toys’ net earnings on a one-quarter lag basis. For example, our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2010 include Toys’ financial results for its first, second and third quarters ended October 30, 2010, as well as Toys’ fourth quarter results of 2009. Because of the seasonality of Toys, our reported net incom
e shows increased volatility. We may also, in the future and from time to time, invest in other businesses that may report financial results that are more volatile than our historical financial results.

We depend upon our anchor tenants to attract shoppers.

We own several regional malls and other shopping centers that are typically anchored by well-known department stores and other tenants who generate shopping traffic at the mall or shopping center. The value of our properties would be adversely affected if tenants or anchors failed to meet their contractual obligations, sought concessions in order to continue operations or ceased their operations, including as a result of bankruptcy. If the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to economic conditions, closing of anchors or for other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the event of a default by a tenant or anchor, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord.

Our decision to dispose of real estate assets would change the holding period assumption in our valuation analyses, which could result in material impairment losses and adversely affect our financial results.

We evaluate real estate assets for impairment based on the projected cash flow of the asset over our anticipated holding period.  If we change our intended holding period, due to our intention to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset, then under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must reevaluate whether that asset is impaired.  Depending on the carrying value of the property at the time we change our intention and the amount that we estimate we would receive on disposal, we may record an impairment loss that would adversely affect our financial results. This loss could be material to our results of operations in the period that it is recognized.

We invest in subordinated or mezzanine debt of certain entities that have significant real estate assets.  These investments involve greater risk of loss than investments in senior mortgage loans.

We invest, and may in the future invest, in subordinated or mezzanine debt of certain entities that have significant real estate assets.  These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate.  These investments involve greater risk of loss than investments in senior mortgage loans which are secured by real property.  If a borrower defaults on debt to us or on debt senior to us, or declares bankruptcy, we may not be able to recover some or all of our investment.  In addition, there may be significant delays and costs associated with the process of foreclosing on collateral securing or supporting these investments.  The value of the assets securing or supporting our investments
 could deteriorate over time due to factors beyond our control, including acts or omissions by owners, changes in business, economic or market conditions, or foreclosure.  Such deteriorations in value may result in the recognition of impairment losses and/or valuation allowances on our statements of income.  As of December 31, 2010, our investments in mezzanine debt securities have an aggregate carrying amount of $202,412,000, net of a $73,216,000 valuation allowance.


We evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal of each of our loans whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such amounts may not be recoverable.  A loan is impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the estimated fair value of the loan or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  There can be no assurance that our estimates of collectible amounts will not change over time or that they will be representative of the amounts we will actually collect, including amounts we would collect if we chose to sell these investments before their maturity.  If we
 collect less than our estimates, we will record impairment losses which could be material.

We invest in marketable equity securities of companies that have significant real estate assets.  The value of these investments may decline as a result of operating performance or economic or market conditions.

We invest in marketable equity securities of publicly-traded real estate companies or companies that have significant real estate assets, such as J.C. Penney.  As of December 31, 2010, our marketable securities have an aggregate carrying amount of $766,116,000.  Significant declines in the value of these investments due to operating performance or economic or market conditions may result in the recognition of impairment losses which could be material.

Our Organizational and Financial Structure Gives Rise to Operational and Financial Risks.

We May Not Be Able to Obtain Capital to Make Investments.

We depend primarily on external financing to fund the growth of our business. This is because one of the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for a REIT is that it distributes 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its shareholders. There is a separate requirement to distribute net capital gains or pay a corporate level tax in lieu thereof. Our access to debt or equity financing depends on the willingness of third parties to lend or make equity investments and on conditions in the capital markets generally. Although we believe that we will be able to finance any investments we may wish to make in the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that new financing will be available or available on acceptable terms.  For information about our available sources of funds, see “ManagementR
17;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) depends on dividends and distributions from its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The creditors and preferred security holders of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to Vornado.

Substantially all of Vornado’s assets are held through its Operating Partnership that holds substantially all of its properties and assets through subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership’s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by its subsidiaries, and in turn, substantially all of Vornado’s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by the Operating Partnership. The creditors of each of Vornado’s direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations to them, when due and payable, before distributions may be made by that subsidiary to its equity holders. Thus, the Operating Partnership’s ability to make distributions to holders of its units depends on its subsidiaries’ ability first to satisfy their obligations to their creditors and then to make d
istributions to the Operating Partnership. Likewise, Vornado’s ability to pay dividends to holders of common and preferred shares depends on the Operating Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions payable to holders of preferred units and then to make distributions to Vornado.

Furthermore, the holders of preferred units of the Operating Partnership are entitled to receive preferred distributions before payment of distributions to holders of Class A units of the Operating Partnership, including Vornado. Thus, Vornado’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders and satisfy its debt obligations depends on the Operating Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions to holders of its preferred units and then to holders of its Class A units, including Vornado.  As of December 31, 2010, there were seven series of preferred units of the Operating Partnership not held by Vornado with a total liquidation value of $316,165,000.

In addition, Vornado’s participation in any distribution of the assets of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency, is only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors and preferred security holders, are satisfied.


We have outstanding debt,

and the amount of debt

and its cost may increase and refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $13.


billion of total debt outstanding, including our pro rata share of debt of partially owned entities, and excluding $37 billion for our pro rata share of LNR’s liabilities related to its consolidated CMBS and CDO trusts, which are non-recourse to LNR and its equity holders, including us.  Our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value was approximately 44%. When we say “enterprise value” in the preceding sentence, we mean market equity value of our common and preferred shares plus total debt outstanding, including our pro rata share of debt of partially owned entities, and excluding LNR’s liabilities related to its consolidated CMBS and CDO trusts.  In the future, we may incur additional debt to fin
ance acquisitions or property developments and thus increase our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value. If our level of indebtedness increases, there may be an increased risk of a credit rating downgrade or a default on our obligations that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in a rising interest rate environment, the cost of existing variable rate debt and any new debt or other market rate security or instrument may increase.  Furthermore, we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms.

Covenants in our debt instruments could adversely affect our financial condition and our acquisitions and development activities.

The mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage. Our unsecured credit facilities, unsecured debt securities and other loans that we may obtain in the future contain, or may contain, customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including covenants that limit our ability to incur debt based upon the level of our ratio of total debt to total assets, our ratio of secured debt to total assets, our ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, and fixed charges, and that require us to maintain a certain level of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt. Our ability to borrow is subject to compliance with these and other covenants. In addition
, failure to comply with our covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt instrument, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or may be available only on unattractive terms.

We rely on debt financing, including borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities, issuances of unsecured debt securities and debt secured by individual properties, to finance acquisitions and development activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt financing from these or other sources, or refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected. If we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders can declare a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of the property securing the defaulted loan.

Vornado may fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT and may be required to pay income taxes at corporate rates.

Although we believe that we will remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may fail to remain qualified in this way. Qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. Our qualification as a REIT also depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to the requirements for qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT.

If, with respect to any taxable year, we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions, we could not deduct distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The federal income tax payable would include any applicable alternative minimum tax. If we had to pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute to shareholders and pay our indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved, and we would no longer be required to make distributions to shareholders. In addition, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost, unless we were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory
 provisions. Although we currently intend to operate in a manner designed to allow us to qualify as a REIT, future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause us to revoke the REIT election or fail to qualify as a REIT.


We face possible adverse changes in tax laws, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.

From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. The shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for payment of dividends.

Loss of our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common shares.

We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Vornado, and Michael D. Fascitelli, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado. While we believe that we could find replacements for these and other key personnel, the loss of their services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common shares.

Vornado’s charter documents and applicable law may hinder any attempt to acquire us.

Our Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust sets limits on the ownership of our shares.

Generally, for Vornado to maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% in value of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of Vornado may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of Vornado’s taxable year. The Internal Revenue Code defines “individuals” for purposes of the requirement described in the preceding sentence to include some types of entities. Under Vornado’s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as amended, no person may own more than 6.7% of the outstanding common shares of any class, or 9.9% of the outstanding preferred shares of any class, with some exceptions for persons who held common shares in excess of the 6.7% limit before Vornado adopted the limit and other persons approved by Vornado’s
 Board of Trustees. These restrictions on transferability and ownership may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the shareholders. We refer to Vornado’s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as amended, as the “declaration of trust.”

Vornado has a classified Board of Trustees and that may reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Vornado’s Board of Trustees is divided into three classes of trustees. Trustees of each class are chosen for three-year staggered terms. Staggered terms of trustees may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of Vornado, even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of Vornado’s shareholders.

We may issue additional shares in a manner that could adversely affect the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Vornado’s declaration of trust authorizes the Board of Trustees to:

·

cause Vornado to issue additional authorized but unissued common shares or preferred shares;

·

classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred shares;

·

set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified shares that Vornado issues; and

·

increase, without shareholder approval, the number of shares of beneficial interest that Vornado may issue.

The Board of Trustees could establish a series of preferred shares whose terms could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of Vornado’s shareholders, although the Board of Trustees does not now intend to establish a series of preferred shares of this kind. Vornado’s declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders.


The Maryland General Corporation Law contains provisions that may reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.

Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, as amended, which we refer to as the “MGCL,” as applicable to REITs, certain “business combinations,” including certain mergers, consolidations, share exchanges and asset transfers and certain issuances and reclassifications of equity securities, between a Maryland REIT and any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the trust’s shares or an affiliate or an associate, as defined in the MGCL, of the trust who, at any time within the two-year period before the date in question, was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting shares of beneficial interest of the trust, which we refer to as an “interested shareholder,” or an affiliate of the interested shareholder, are prohibited fo
r five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder. After that five-year period, any business combination of these kinds must be recommended by the board of trustees of the trust and approved by the affirmative vote of at least (a) 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares of beneficial interest of the trust and (b) two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting shares of beneficial interest of the trust other than shares held by the interested shareholder with whom, or with whose affiliate, the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested shareholder.  These supermajority voting requirements do not apply if the trust’s common shareholders receive a minimum price, as defined in the MGCL, for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common s
hares.

The provisions of the MGCL do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of trustees of the applicable trust before the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, and a person is not an interested shareholder if the board of trustees approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested shareholder.

In approving a transaction, the Board may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the Board.  Vornado’s Board has adopted a resolution exempting any business combination between Vornado and any trustee or officer of Vornado or its affiliates.  As a result, any trustee or officer of Vornado or its affiliates may be able to enter into business combinations with Vornado that may not be in the best interest of Vornado’s shareholders. With respect to business combinations with other persons, the business combination provisions of the MGCL may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of the shareholders. Th
e business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of Vornado and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.

We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our shareholders.

Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other companies, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Trustees. Accordingly, our shareholders do not control these policies.

Our Ownership Structure and Related-Party Transactions May Give Rise to Conflicts of Interest.

Steven Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of our other trustees and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.

As of December 31, 2010, Interstate Properties, a New Jersey general partnership, and its partners owned approximately 7.0% of the common shares of Vornado and approximately 27.2% of the common stock of Alexander’s, which is described below.  Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the three partners of Interstate Properties. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board of Vornado, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties and the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s. Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are trustees of Vornado and also directors of Alexander’s.

Because of these overlapping interests, Mr. Roth and Interstate Properties and its partners may have substantial influence over Vornado and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Vornado

's

shareholders for approval. In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate Properties and our other equity or debt holders. In addition, Mr. Roth, Interstate Properties and its partners, and Alexander’s currently and may in the future engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as which of these entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of pote
ntial business opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these entities.


We currently manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate Properties under a management agreement for which

we

receive an annual fee equal to 4% of base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a one-year term and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term.  Because of the relationship among Vornado, Interstate Properties and Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight, as described above, the terms of the management agreement and any future agreements between

us

and Interstate Properties may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.

There may be conflicts of interest between Alexander’s and us.

As of December 31, 2010, we owned 32.4% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s. Alexander’s is a REIT engaged in leasing, managing, developing and redeveloping properties, focusing primarily on the locations where its department stores operated before they ceased operations in 1992. Alexander’s has seven properties, which are located in the greater New York metropolitan area.  In addition to the 2.3% that they indirectly own through Vornado, Interstate Properties, which is described above, and its partners owned 27.2% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s as of December 31, 2010. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board of Vornado, the managing general partner of Interstate, and the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s.  Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are 
trustees of Vornado and also directors of Alexander’s and general partners of Interstate.  Michael D. Fascitelli is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado and the President of Alexander’s and Dr. Richard West is a trustee of Vornado and a director of Alexander’s.  In addition, Joseph Macnow, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, holds the same position with Alexander’s.  Alexander’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “ALX.”

We manage, develop and lease Alexander’s properties under management and development agreements and leasing agreements under which we receive annual fees from Alexander’s. These agreements have a one-year term expiring in March of each year and are all automatically renewable. Because Vornado and Alexander’s share common senior management and because certain of the trustees of Vornado constitute a majority of the directors of Alexander’s, the terms of the foregoing agreements and any future agreements between us and Alexander’s may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.

For a description of Interstate Properties’ ownership of Vornado and Alexander’s, see “Steven Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of our other trustees and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us” above.


The Number of Shares of Vornado Realty Trust and the
Market for Those Shares Give Rise to Various Risks.

The trading price of our common shares has been
volatile and may fluctuate.

The trading price of our common shares has been
volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of a number of
factors, many of which are outside our control.  In addition, the stock
market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that
affect the market prices of the shares of many companies.  These broad
market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the
market price of our common shares.  Among the factors that could affect the
price of our common shares are:

·

our
financial condition and performance;

·

the
financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies
or defaults;

·

the
reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and the attractiveness
of REIT equity securities in

comparison to other equity securities,
including securities issued by other real estate companies, and fixed

income
securities;

·

uncertainty and volatility in the equity and credit
markets;

·

changes in revenue or earnings estimates or
publication of research reports and recommendations by financial

analysts or
actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of
other real estate investment

trusts;

·

failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings
estimates;

·

speculation in the press or investment community;

·

strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as
acquisitions or restructurings;

·

the
extent of institutional interest in us;

·

the
extent of short-selling of our common shares and the shares of our competitors;

·

fluctuations in the stock price and operating
results of our competitors;

·

general financial and economic market conditions
and, in particular, developments related to market conditions

for real
estate investment trusts and other real estate related companies;

·

domestic and international economic factors
unrelated to our performance; and

·

all
other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this document.

A significant
decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for
shareholders.

Vornado has many
shares available for future sale, which could hurt the market price of its
shares.

The interests of our current shareholders could be
diluted if we issue additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2010, we
had authorized but unissued, 66,338,125 common shares of beneficial interest,
$.04 par value and 77,659,991 preferred shares of beneficial interest, no par
value; of which 39,203,325 common shares are reserved for issuance upon
redemption of Class A Operating Partnership units, convertible securities and
employee stock options and 7,200,000 preferred shares are reserved for issuance
upon redemption of preferred Operating Partnership units.  Any shares not
reserved may be issued from time to time in public or private offerings or in
connection with acquisitions.  In addition, common and preferred shares
reserved may be sold upon issuance in the public market after registration under
the Securities Act or under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or other
available exemptions from registration.  We cannot predict the effect that
future sales of our common and preferred shares or Operating Partnership Class A
and preferred units will have on the market prices of our outstanding
shares.

Increased market
interest rates may hurt the value of our common and preferred
shares.

We believe that investors consider the distribution
rate on REIT shares, expressed as a percentage of the price of the shares,
relative to market interest rates as an important factor in deciding whether to
buy or sell the shares. If market interest rates go up, prospective purchasers
of REIT shares may expect a higher distribution rate. Higher interest rates
would likely increase our borrowing costs and might decrease funds available for
distribution. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of
our common and preferred shares to decline.

New York Office Properties lease terms generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 15 years for major tenants, and may provide for extension options at market rates. Leases typically provide for periodic step‑ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants their share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year. Electricity is provided to tenants on a sub-metered basis or included in rent based on surveys and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases. Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.

typically provide for periodic step-ups in rent over the term of the lease and
pass through to tenants, the tenants’ share of increases in real estate taxes
and certain property operating expenses over a base year. Periodic step-ups in
rent are usually based upon either fixed percentage increases or the consumer
price index. Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for
all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its
premises.

RETAIL PROPERTIES

As of December 31, 2010, our portfolio consisted of 161 retail properties, of which 130 are strip shopping centers located primarily in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and California; 7 are regional malls located in New York, New Jersey, Virginia and San Juan, Puerto Rico; and 24 are retail properties located in Manhattan (“Manhattan Street Retail”).  Our strip shopping centers and malls are generally located on major highways in mature, densely populated areas, and therefore attract consumers from a regional, rather than a neighborhood market place.

Strip Shopping Centers

Our strip shopping centers contain an aggregate of

17.2

million square feet, of which we own 16.


million square feet.  These properties are substantially (approximately 80%) leased to large stores (over 20,000 square feet). Tenants include destination retailers such as discount department stores, supermarkets, home improvement stores, discount apparel stores and membership warehouse clubs. Tenants typically offer basic consumer necessities such as food, health and beauty aids, moderately priced clothing, building materials and home improvement supplies, and compete primarily on the basis of price and location.

Regional Malls

The Green Acres Mall in Valley Stream, Long Island, New York contains 1.8 million square feet, and is anchored by Macy’s, Sears, Wal-Mart, Kohl’s, J.C. Penney, Best Buy and  BJ’s Wholesale Club.

The Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, New Jersey, in which we own a 50% interest, contains 1.5 million square feet and is anchored by Macy’s, Lord & Taylor and J.C. Penney, two of which own their stores aggregating 457,000 square feet.

The Springfield Mall in Springfield, Virginia, contains 1.4 million square feet and is anchored by Macy’s, J.C. Penney and Target, two of which own their stores aggregating 390,000 square feet.  We continue to evaluate plans to renovate and reposition the mall.

The Bergen Town Center in Paramus, New Jersey contains 930,000 square feet and is anchored by Century 21, Whole Foods and Target.

The Broadway Mall in Hicksville, Long Island, New York contains 1.1 million square feet and is anchored by Macy’s, Ikea, National Amusements and Target, which owns its store containing 141,000 square feet.

The Montehiedra Mall in San Juan, Puerto Rico contains 540,000 square feet and is anchored by Home Depot, Kmart, and Marshalls.

The Las Catalinas Mall in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contains 495,000 square feet and is anchored by Kmart and Sears, which owns its 139,000 square foot store.

Manhattan Street Retail

Manhattan Street Retail is comprised of 24 properties containing 1.1 million square feet.  In addition, we own 821,000 square feet of retail space in certain of our New York office buildings, which is part of our New York Office Properties segment.  Our Manhattan Street Retail properties include (i) properties in the Penn Plaza district, such as the Manhattan Mall which contains 243,000 square feet, anchored by JC Penney; (ii) 4 Union Square which contains 203,000 square feet, anchored by Whole Foods Market, Filenes Basement and DSW; (iii) 1540 Broadway in Times Square which contains 160,000 square feet, anchored by Forever 21 and Disney, (iv) 510 Fifth Avenue which contains 59,000 square feet, anchored by Joe Fresh; and (v) properties on Madison Avenue and in So-Ho occupied by retailers including H&M, Top Shop, Madewell, GAP, Gucci, Chloe and Cartier.&n

Retail Properties lease terms generally range from five years or less in some instances for smaller tenants to as long as 25 years for major tenants.  Leases generally provide for reimbursements of real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges (including roof and structure in strip shopping centers, unless it is the tenant’s direct responsibility), and percentage rents based on tenant sales volume.  Percentage rents accounted for less than 1% of the Retail Properties total revenues during 2010.

In March 2010, we ceased making debt service payments on the mortgage loan secured by the High Point Complex in North Carolina as a result of insufficient cash flow and the loan went into default.  In November 2010, the property was placed in receivership.  While the receivership process is inherently lengthy, we anticipate that the property will be sold in the first half of 2011, at which time the assets and liabilities will be removed from our consolidated balance sheet and we will recognize a net gain of approximately $80,000,000.  Accordingly, we have reclassified the results of operations of the property to “(loss) income from discontinued operations,” and the related assets and liabilities to “assets related to discontinued operations” and “liabilities related to discontinued operations” for all periods presented in 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Office lease terms generally range from three to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 15 years for major tenants. Leases typically provide for periodic step-ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants their share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year. Electricity is provided to tenants on a sub-metered basis or included in rent and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases. Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction of its premises.

Lease terms generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 15 years for major tenants, and may provide for extension options at market rates. Leases typically provide for periodic step‑ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants their share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year.  Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.

Item 3.        Legal Proceedings

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including the matters referred to below, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (“USDC-NJ”) claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that a prior order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York dated February 6, 2001, as modified on appeal to the District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 13, 2001, froze our right to reallocate which effectively terminated our right to collect the additional rent from Stop & Shop. On March 3
, 2003, after we moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Stop & Shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint. On March 26, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a new complaint in New York State Supreme Court, asserting substantially the same claims as in its USDC-NJ complaint. We removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In January 2005 that court remanded the action to the New York State Supreme Court. On February 14, 2005, we served an answer in which we asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denyin
g the motions for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Court’s decision and on December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Court’s decision.  On January 16, 2007, we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Court’s decision which was denied on March 13, 2007.  Discovery is complete and a trial was held in November 2010, with closing arguments expected in March 2011.  We intend to continue to vigorously pursue our claims against Stop & Shop.

In July 2005, we acquired H Street Building Corporation (“H Street”) which has a subsidiary that owns, among other things, a 50% tenancy in common interest in land located in Arlington County, Virginia, known as "Pentagon Row," leased to two tenants, Street Retail, Inc. and Post Apartment Homes, L.P.  In April 2007, H Street acquired the remaining 50% interest in that fee.  On September 25, 2008, both tenants filed suit against us and the former owners claiming the right of first offer to purchase the fee interest, damages in excess of $75,000,000 and punitive damages.  In April 2010, the Trial Court entered judgment in favor of the tenants, that we sell the land to the tenants for a net sales price of $14,992,000, representing the Trial Court’s allocation of our purchase price for H Street.  The request for damages 
and punitive damages was denied.  As a result of the Trial Court’s decision, we recorded a $10,056,000 loss accrual in the first quarter of 2010.  We filed a motion to appeal the Trial Court’s decision, which the appeals court refused to hear.  Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2010, we sold the property to the tenants for $14,992,000 in cash (our reduced carrying amount).

________________________________

(1)   FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”).  NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, extraordinary items and other specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of re
al estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions.  FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flows as a liquidity measure.  FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Overview

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 93.2% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2010. All references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership.

We own and operate office, retail and showroom properties (our “core” operations) with large concentrations of office and retail properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area. In addition, we have a 32.7% interest in Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”) which has a significant real estate component, a 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX) (“Alexander’s”), which has seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, as well as interests in other real estate and related investments.

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. Below is a table comparing our performance to the Morgan Stanley REIT Index (“RMS”) and the SNL REIT Index (“SNL”) for the following periods ended December 31, 2010:

(1) Past performance is not necessarily indicative of how we will perform in the future.

We intend to achieve our business objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through:

·

Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

·

Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;

·

Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

·

Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;

·

Developing and redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value ; and

·

Investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets.  We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities in the future.

We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.  See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.

Substantially all businesses, including ours, were negatively affected by the 2008/2009 economic recession and illiquidity and volatility in the capital and financial markets.  Although there are signs of an economic recovery and greater stability in the capital and financial markets, it is not possible for us to predict whether these trends will continue in the future or quantify the impact of these or any other trends on our financial results.

2010 Acquisitions and Investments

Vornado Capital Partners, L.P. and Vornado Capital
Partners Parallel, L.P. (the “Fund”)

On July 6, 2010,
we completed an initial closing of the Fund with aggregate equity commitments of
$550,000,000, of which we committed $200,000,000.  We expect to close on an
additional $250,000,000 of equity commitments in the first quarter of
2011.  We are the general partner and investment manager of the Fund and it
is our exclusive investment vehicle during the three-year investment period for
all investments that fit within the Fund’s investment parameters, including
debt, equity and other interests in real estate, and excluding (i) investments
in vacant land and ground-up development; (ii) investments acquired by merger or
primarily for our securities or properties; (iii) properties which can be
combined with or relate to our existing properties; (iv) securities of
commercial mortgage loan servicers and investments derived from any such
investments; (v) noncontrolling interests in equity and debt securities; and
(vi) investments located outside of North America.   The Fund has a
term of eight years.  We consolidate the accounts of the Fund into our
consolidated financial statements.  In 2010, we incurred $6,482,000 for
organization costs of the Fund, net of the Fund’s reimbursement to us, which are
included in “general and administrative” expenses on our consolidated statement
of income.

The Fund is
accounted for under the AICPA Investment Company Guide and its investments are
reported on its balance sheet at fair value, with changes in value each period
recognized in earnings.  As of December 31, 2010, the Fund received
$146,789,000 of capital from partners, including $53,378,000 from us. 
During the second half of 2010, the Fund made four investments aggregating
approximately $145,000,000 and reimbursed us for $1,500,000 of organization
costs.

Investment in J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (“J.C.
Penney”) (NYSE: JCP)

We own an
economic interest in 23,400,000 J.C. Penney common shares, or 9.9% of J.C.
Penney’s outstanding common shares.  Below are the details of our
investment.

We own
18,584,010 common shares at an average price of $25.70 per share, or
$477,678,000 in the aggregate.  These shares, which have an aggregate fair
value of $600,449,000 at December 31, 2010, are included in marketable equity
securities on our consolidated balance sheet and are classified as “available
for sale.”  Of these shares, 15,500,000 were acquired through the exercise
of a call option that originated on September 28, 2010 and settled on November
9, 2010.  During the period in which the call option was outstanding and
classified as a derivative instrument, we recognized $112,537,000 of income from
the mark-to-market of the underlying common shares, which is included in
“interest and other investment income (loss), net” on our consolidated statement
of income.  During the period from November 10 through December 31, 2010,
we recognized $10,234,000 from the mark-to-market of the common shares
classified as available-for-sale, which is included in “accumulated other
comprehensive income” (a component of shareholders’ equity on our consolidated
balance sheet).

We also own an
economic interest in 4,815,990 common shares through a forward contract executed
on October 7, 2010, at a weighted average strike price of $28.65 per share, or
$137,989,000 in the aggregate.  The contract may be settled, at our
election, in cash or common shares, in whole or in part, at any time prior to
October 9, 2012.  The counterparty may accelerate settlement, in whole or
in part, upon one year’s notice to us.  The strike price per share
increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 80 basis points and decreases for
dividends received on the shares.  The contract is a derivative instrument
that does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  Mark-to-market
adjustments on the underlying common shares are recognized in “interest and
other investment income (loss), net” on our consolidated statement of
income.  During the period from October 7, 2010 through December 31, 2010,
we recognized $17,616,000 of income from the mark-to-market of this position,
based on J.C. Penney’s closing share price of $32.31 at December 31,
2010.

As of December
31, 2010, the aggregate economic net gain on our investment in J.C. Penney was
$140,387,000, based on J.C. Penney’s closing share price of $32.31 per share and
our weighted average cost of $26.31 per share.

2010 Acquisitions and Investments – continued

Investment in LNR Property Corporation
(“LNR”)

On July 29,
2010, as a part of LNR’s recapitalization, we acquired a 26.2% equity interest
in LNR for $116,000,000 in cash and conversion into equity of our $15,000,000
mezzanine loan (the then current carrying amount) made to LNR’s parent, Riley
Holdco Corp.  The recapitalization involved an infusion of a total of
$417,000,000 in new cash equity and the reduction of LNR’s total debt to
$425,000,000 from $1.3 billion, excluding liabilities related to the
consolidated CMBS and CDO trusts described below.  We account for our
equity interest in LNR under the equity method on a one-quarter lag basis.

LNR consolidates
certain commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) and Collateralized Debt
Obligation (“CDO”) trusts for which it is the primary beneficiary.  The
assets of these trusts (primarily commercial mortgage loans), which aggregate
approximately $142 billion as of September 30, 2010, are the sole source of
repayment of the related liabilities, which are non-recourse to LNR and its
equity holders, including us.  Changes in the fair value of these assets
each period are offset by changes in the fair value of the related liabilities
through LNR’s consolidated income statement.

510 Fifth
Avenue

On October 8,
2010, we acquired 510 Fifth Avenue, a 59,000 square foot retail property located
at 43

rd

Street and Fifth Avenue in New York, for $57,000,000,
comprised of $24,700,000 in cash and $32,300,000 of existing debt.  We
consolidate the accounts of this property into our consolidated financial
statements from the date of the acquisition.

San Jose, California

On October 15,
2010, we acquired the 55% interest that we did not already own of a 646,000
square foot retail property located in San Jose, California, for $97,000,000,
consisting of $27,000,000 in cash and $70,000,000 of existing debt.  We
consolidate the accounts of the property into our consolidated financial
statements from the date of this acquisition.

Atlantic City, New Jersey

On November 4,
2010, we acquired 11.3 acres of the land under a portion of the Borgata Hotel
and Casino complex for $83,000,000 in cash.  The land is leased to the
partnership that controls the Borgata Hotel and Casino complex through December
2070.  In January 2011, we completed a 10-year $60,000,000 financing of
this land.  The loan has a fixed interest rate of 5.14% and amortizes
beginning in the third year, based on a 30-year schedule.


O

verview – continued

2010 Dispositions

On October 20, 2010, we sold a 45% ownership interest in 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue (the Warner Building) and 1101 17

th

Street, for $236,700,000, comprised of $91,000,000 in cash and the assumption of existing mortgage debt.  We retained the remaining 55% ownership interest and continue to manage and lease the properties.  Based on the Warner Building’s implied fair value of $445,000,000, we recognized a net gain of $54,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The gain on 1101 17

th

Street, based on an implied fair value of $81,000,000, will be recognized when we monetize our investment.  We share control over major decisions with our joint venture partner.  Accordingly, these properties are accounted for under the equity method from the date of the sale.

On January 12, 2011, we sold 1140 Connecticut Avenue and contracted to sell 1227 25

th

Street, subject to customary closing conditions, for an aggregate price of $127,000,000.  We will retain net proceeds of approximately $107,000,000, after repaying an existing mortgage and recognize a net gain of approximately $44,000,000 in the first quarter of 2011.

In March 2010, we ceased making debt service payments on the mortgage loan secured by the High Point Complex in North Carolina as a result of insufficient cash flow and the loan went into default.  In November 2010, the property was placed in receivership.  While the receivership process is inherently lengthy, we anticipate that the property will be sold in the first half of 2011, at which time the assets and liabilities will be removed from our consolidated balance sheet and we will recognize a net gain of approximately $80,000,000.  Accordingly, we have reclassified the results of operations of the property to “(loss) income from discontinued operations,” and the related assets and liabilities to “assets related to discontinued operations” and “liabilities related to discontinued operations” for all periods presented in 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

2010 Financing Activities

On February 11, 2011, we completed a $425,000,000 refinancing of Two Penn Plaza, a 1.6 million square foot Manhattan office building.  The seven-year loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%, which was swapped for the term of the loan to a fixed rate of 5.13%.  The loan amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the fourth year.  We retained net proceeds of approximately $139,000,000 after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.

On February 10, 2011, we completed a $150,000,000 financing of 2121 Crystal Drive, a 506,000 square foot office building located in Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia.  The 12-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 5.51% and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in third year.  This property was previously unencumbered.

On January 10, 2011, we completed a $75,000,000 financing of North Bergen (Tonnelle Avenue), a 410,000 square foot strip shopping center.  The seven-year fixed rate loan bears interest rate at 4.59%, provides for interest only payments during the first five years of the term and amortizes based on a 25-year schedule. This property was previously unencumbered.

In December 2010, we acquired the mortgage loan secured by the Springfield Mall, located in Fairfax County, Virginia for $115,000,000 in cash.  The loan had an outstanding balance of $171,500,000.  In a separate transaction, we acquired our partner’s interest in the partnership that owns the mall in exchange for $25,000,000

in

Operating Partnership units.  These transactions resulted in a $102,932,000 net gain on early extinguishment of debt.

In August 2010, we sold $660,000,000 of 10-year mortgage notes in a single issuer securitization.  The notes are comprised of a $600,000,000 fixed rate component and a $60,000,000 variable rate component and are cross-collateralized by 40 of our strip shopping centers.  The $600,000,000 fixed rate portion bears interest at an initial rate of 4.18% and a weighted average rate of 4.31% over the 10-year term and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule.  The variable rate portion bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.36%, with a 1% floor (2.36% at December 31, 2010).

In March 2010, we completed a public offering of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due April 1, 2015 and retained net proceeds of approximately $496,000,000.  The notes were sold at 99.834% of their face amount to yield 4.287%.  The notes can be redeemed without penalty beginning January 1, 2015.

In 2010, through open market repurchases and tender offers, we purchased $270,491,000 aggregate face amount ($264,476,000 aggregate carrying amount) of our convertible senior debentures and $17,000,000 aggregate face amount ($16,981,000 aggregate carrying amount) of our senior unsecured notes for $274,857,000 and $17,382,000 in cash, respectively, resulting in a net loss of $10,381,000 and $401,000, respectively.

Recently Issued Accounting Literature

In the fourth quarter of 2010

,

the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an update

to the guidance contained in Accounting Standards

Codification (“ASC”)

310,

Receivables

.

The new guidance requires companies to provide more information

about the credit quality of their financing receivables in the disclosures to financial statements

including, but not limited to, significant purchases and sales of financing receivables

,

aging information and credit quality indicators. The adoption of this accounting

guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements

.

On January 21, 2010, the FASB issued an update to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, adding new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 fair value measurements and additional disclosures about the activity within Level 3 fair value measurements.  The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2010 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued an update to ASC 810, Consolidation, which modifies the existing quantitative guidance used in determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”) by requiring entities to qualitatively assess whether an enterprise is a primary beneficiary, based on whether the entity has (i) power over the significant activities of the VIE, and (ii) an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE.  The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2010 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Real Estate

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $14.9 billion and $15.1 billion, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. If we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated.  As real estate is undergoing development activities, all property operating expenses, including interest expense, are capitalized to the cost of real property to the extent we believe such costs are recoverable through the value of the property.<
/FONT>

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles such as acquired above and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including historical operating results, known trends and market/economic conditions.

Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis.  An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared.  If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods

,

or market conditions change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be di
fferent and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.  The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.  Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.


Critical Accounting Policies – continued

Identified Intangibles

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases, tenant relationships and acquired in-place leases) were $348,745,000 and $439,549,000, respectively. The carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of “deferred credit” on our consolidated balance sheets, were $528,905,000 and $606,390,000, respectively.  Identified intangibles are recorded at their estimated fair value, separate and apart from goodwill. Identified intangibles that are determined to have finite lives are amortized over the period in which they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired.  Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indi
cate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of the identified intangible over its estimated fair value.  If intangible assets are impaired or estimated useful lives change, the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material.

Mezzanine Loans Receivable

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying amounts of mezzanine loans receivable were $202,412,000 and $203,286,000, respectively, net of valuation allowances of $73,216,000 and $190,738,000, respectively.  We invest in mezzanine loans

of

entities that have significant real estate assets.  These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate.  We record these investments at the stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium.  We accrete or amortize any discount or premium over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest method or straight-line method, if the result is not materially different.
 We evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal of each of our loans whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such amounts may not be recoverable. A loan is impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the estimated fair value of the loan or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If our estimates of the collectability of both interest and principal or the fair value of our loans change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Partially Owned Entities

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying amounts of investments in partially owned entities, including Alexander’s and Toys “R” Us, were $1.


billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. In determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we have the power over significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity. We account for investments 
on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions each period. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method.

Investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared.  The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions.  If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluat
ion of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.    The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.


Critical
Accounting Policies – continued

Allowance For
Doubtful Accounts

We periodically
evaluate the collectability of amounts due from tenants and maintain an
allowance for doubtful accounts ($62,979,000 and $46,708,000 as of December 31,
2010 and 2009) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to
make required payments under their lease agreements. We also maintain an
allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents ($7,323,000
and $4,672,000 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively). This receivable
arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the
lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances
and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these
estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be
material to our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue
Recognition

We have the
following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:

·

Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases.
These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on
a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent
abatements under the leases.  We commence rental revenue recognition when
the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is
substantially ready for its intended use.  In addition, in circumstances
where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned
by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

·

Percentage Rent —
income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon tenant sales
exceeding defined thresholds. These rents are recognized only after the
contingency has been removed (i.e., when tenant sales thresholds have been
achieved).

·

Hotel Revenue —
income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of
rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is
recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are
recognized when the services have been rendered.

·

Trade Shows Revenue —
income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths.
This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred.

·

Expense
Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the
recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of
the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the
expenses are incurred.

·

Management, Leasing
and Other Fees — income arising from contractual agreements with third parties
or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related
services are performed under the respective agreements.

Before we
recognize revenue, we assess, among other things, its collectibility. If our
assessment of the collectibility of revenue changes, the impact on our
consolidated financial statements could be material.

Income
Taxes

We operate in a
manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment
Trust (“REIT”) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT
taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets
certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income
which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100%
of our taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is
required. If we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our
shareholders, or fail to meet other REIT requirements, we may fail to qualify as
a REIT which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences.

Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Years Ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 - continued

Notes to preceding tabular information:

(1)   EBITDA represents “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.”  We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize these measures to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)   Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax (benefit) expense in the reconciliation of our net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these items from partially owned entities.

(3)   The components of Other EBITDA are summarized below.  The totals for each of the columns below agree to the total EBITDA for the “other” column in the preceding EBITDA by segment reconciliations.

      non-reimbursable operating expenses of $1,310.

(3)

Primarily
      from the elimination of inter-company fees from operating segments upon
      consolidation.  See note (3) on page 81.

(4)

On March
      31, 2009, our nine most senior executives voluntarily surrendered their
      2007 and 2008 stock option awards and their 2008 out-performance plan
      awards.  Accordingly, we recognized $32,588 of expense in the first
      quarter of 2009, representing the unamortized portion of these
      awards.

(5)

This
      decrease in expense is entirely offset by a corresponding decrease in
      income from the mark-to-market of the deferred compensation plan assets, a
      component of “interest and other investment income (loss), net” on our
      consolidated statements of income.

Primarily
      due to $2,800 of pension plan termination costs in 2009.

$617,994,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $57,724,000.  This decrease
was primarily due to savings of (i) $93,765,000 from the acquisition, retirement
and repayment of an aggregate of $2.1 billion of our convertible senior
debentures and senior unsecured notes in 2009 and (ii) $30,639,000 from the

Net Gain (Loss) on Early Extinguishment of
Debt

In the year
ended December 31, 2010, we recognized a $94,789,000 net gain on the early
extinguishment of debt (primarily from our acquisition of the mortgage loan
secured by the Springfield Mall), compared to a $25,915,000 net loss in the
prior year (primarily from the acquisition of our convertible senior debentures
and related write-off of the unamortized debt discount).

Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly Owned and
Partially Owned Assets

In the year
ended December 31, 2010, we recognized an $81,432,000 net gain on disposition of

expense was $22,476,000 in the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to
$20,642,000 in the prior year, an increase of $1,834,000.  This increase
resulted primarily from higher income at 1290 Avenue of Americas and 555

Same Store EBITDA

Same store
EBITDA represents EBITDA from property level operations which are owned by us in
both the current and prior year reporting periods.  Same store EBITDA
excludes segment-level overhead expenses, which are expenses that we do not
consider to be property-level expenses, as well as other non-operating
items.  We present same store EBITDA on both a GAAP basis and a cash basis,
which excludes income from the straight-lining of rents, amortization of
below-market leases, net of above-market leases and other non-cash adjustments.
We present these non-GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of
the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions
on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the
performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers.  Same
store EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash
flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
employed by other companies.

Below are the
same store EBITDA results on a GAAP and cash basis for each of our segments for
the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31,

Accordingly, we recognized $27,089 of income, representing the buyer’s forfeited non-refundable purchase deposit.  In connection therewith, we wrote down the carrying amount of the land to its fair value and recognized a $24,875 impairment loss which is included as a component of “impairment and other losses” on our consolidated statement of income.

(3)

Results primarily from an increase in the elimination of inter-company fees of our operating segments upon consolidation.

On March 31, 2009, our nine most senior executives voluntarily surrendered their 2007 and 2008 stock option awards and their 2008 out-performance plan awards.  Accordingly, we recognized $32,588 of expense in the first quarter of 2009, representing the unamortized portion of these awards.

(6)

This increase in expense is entirely offset by a corresponding increase in income from the mark-to-market of the deferred compensation plan assets, a component of “interest and other investment income (loss), net” on our consolidated statement of income.

(7)

Primarily from lower payroll and stock-based compensation expense.

ended December 31, 2009, compared to a loss of $2,747,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2008, an increase in loss of $113,603,000. This increase resulted
primarily from:

Interest and Debt Expense

Interest and
debt expense was $617,994,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to
$619,531,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of
$1,537,000.  This decrease resulted primarily from savings of (i)
$17,561,000 from a decrease in outstanding debt of approximately $1.5 billion,
the full year effect of which is approximately $100,000,000, (ii) $27,830,000
from lower average interest rates on variable rate debt (1.61% in 2009 as
compared to 3.88% in 2008), (iii) $1,953,000 from other items, partially offset
by (iv) a decrease in capitalized interest of $45,807,000.

Net (Loss) Gain on Early Extinguishment of
Debt

In the year
ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a $25,915,000 net loss on early
extinguishment of debt (primarily from the acquisition of our convertible senior
debentures and related write-off of the unamortized debt discount), compared to
a $9,820,000 net gain in the prior year (primarily from the acquisition of our
senior unsecured notes and convertible senior debentures).

Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly Owned and
Partially Owned Assets

In the year
ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a $5,641,000 net gain on disposition of
wholly owned and partially owned assets, compared to a $7,757,000 net gain in
the prior year.  The current year and prior year net gain resulted
primarily from the sales of marketable securities and residential
condominiums.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax
expense was $20,642,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to an
income tax benefit of $204,644,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008. 
The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2008 was the result of a
$222,174,000 reversal of deferred taxes recorded in connection with our
acquisition of H Street.  We were required to record these deferred tax
liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C
Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of January 16, 2008, we had
completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT
status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008 and reversed the
deferred tax liabilities.

Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests

Net loss
attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries was
$2,839,000 in the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $3,263,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2008.

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
in the Operating Partnership, including Unit Distributions

Net income
attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership, including
unit distributions for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 is comprised of
allocations of income to redeemable noncontrolling interests of $5,834,000 and
$33,327,000, respectively, and preferred unit distributions of the Operating
Partnership of $19,286,000 and $22,084,000, respectively.  The decrease of
$27,493,000 in allocations of income to redeemable noncontrolling interests
resulted primarily from lower net income subject to allocation to
unitholders.  The decrease of $2,798,000 in preferred unit distributions
was primarily due to a write-off of unit issuance costs in 2008.

Preferred Share Dividends

Preferred share
dividends were $57,076,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to
$57,091,000 for the the year ended December 31, 2008.

Supplemental Information – continued

Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 - continued

Notes to preceding tabular information:

(1)   EBITDA represents “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.”  We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize their measures to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)   Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax expense in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these items from partially owned entities.

(3)   The tables below provide information about EBITDA from certain investments that are included in the “other” column of the preceding EBITDA by segment reconciliations.  The totals for each of the columns below agree to the total EBITDA for the “other” column in the preceding EBITDA by segment reconciliations.

Results of Operations – Three Months Ended December
31, 2010 Compared to December 31, 2009 - continued

Same Store EBITDA

Same store
EBITDA represents EBITDA from property level operations which are owned by us in
both the current and prior year reporting periods.  Same store EBITDA
excludes segment-level overhead expenses, which are expenses that we do not
consider to be property-level expenses, as well as other non-operating
items.  We present same store EBITDA on both a GAAP basis and a cash basis,
which excludes income from the straight-lining of rents, amortization of
below-market leases, net of above-market leases and other non-cash adjustments.
We present these non-GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of
the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions
on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the
performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers.  Same
store EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash
flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
employed by other companies.

Below are the
same store EBITDA results on a GAAP and cash basis for each of our segments for
the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended

Supplemental Information – continued

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the current quarter to the previous quarter. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys’ fourth quarter net income, which we record on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of Toys’ fiscal year net income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. The Merchandise Mart segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage rental income.

Below are the same store EBITDA results on a GAAP and cash basis for each of our segments for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010.

Related Party Transactions

Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees

Alexander’s

We own 32.4% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President and Chief Executive Officer, are officers and directors of Alexander’s.  We provide various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements.  These agreements are described in Note 5 - Investments in Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

On March 2, 2009, Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli each exercised 150,000 stock appreciation rights which were scheduled to expire on March 4, 2009 and each received gross proceeds of $11,419,000.

Interstate Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr. Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s, are Interstate’s two other partners. As of December 31, 2010, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned approximately 7.0% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 27.2% of Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on


days’ notice at the end of the term. We believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies, that the management agreement terms are fair to us.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

We anticipate
that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be
adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of
the Operating Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and
recurring capital expenditures.  Capital requirements for development
expenditures and acquisitions (excluding Fund acquisitions as described below)
may require funding from borrowings and/or equity offerings.  We may from
time to time purchase or retire outstanding debt securities.  Such
purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity
requirements and other factors.  The amounts involved in connection with
these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial
statements.

We have raised,
and may continue to raise, capital for future Real Estate acquisitions through
our real estate Fund.  We are the general partner and investment manager of
the Fund and it is our exclusive investment vehicle for all investments that fit
within the Fund’s investment parameters during its three-year investment
period.

Acquisitions and
Investments

Details of 2010
acquisitions and investments are provided in the “Overview” of Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. 
There were no significant acquisitions or investments during 2009.

Dispositions

Details of 2010
dispositions are provided in the “Overview” of Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.

On September 1,
2009, we sold 1999 K Street, a newly developed 250,000 square foot office
building in Washington’s Central Business District, for $207,800,000 in cash,
which resulted in a net gain of $41,211,000, which is included as a component of
“(loss) income from discontinued operations” on our consolidated statement of
income.

During 2009, we
sold 15 retail properties in separate transactions for an aggregate of
$55,000,000 in cash, which resulted in net gains aggregating $4,073,000, which
is included as a component of “(loss) income from discontinued operations” on
our consolidated statement of income.

Mezzanine
Loans

On January 28,
2010, we were repaid the entire $99,314,000 balance of the Equinox loan
including accrued interest.  This loan, which we acquired in 2006 for
$57,500,000, was scheduled to mature in February 2013.

On June 1, 2009,
we were repaid the entire $41,758,000 balance of the Charles Square Hotel loan
including accrued interest.  This loan was scheduled to mature in September
2009.

Financing Activities

Details of 2010
financings are provided in the “Overview” of Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.

In April 2009,
we sold 17,250,000 common shares, including underwriters’ over-allotment, in an
underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement at
an initial public offering price of $43.00 per share.  We received net
proceeds of $710,226,000, after underwriters’ discount and offering expenses and
contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for
17,250,000 Class A units of the Operating Partnership.

On September 30,
2009, we completed a public offering of $460,000,000 principal amount of 7.875%
callable senior unsecured 30-year notes (NYSE: VNOD) due October 1, 2039. 
The notes were sold to the public at par and may be redeemed at our option, in
whole or in part, beginning in October 2014 at a price equal to the principal
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.  We received net proceeds of
approximately $446,000,000 from the offering which were used to repay debt and
for general corporate purposes.

During 2009, we
purchased $1,912,724,000 (aggregate face amount) of our convertible senior
debentures and $352,740,000 (aggregate face amount) of our senior unsecured
notes for $1,877,510,000 and $343,694,000 in cash, respectively.  This debt
was acquired through tender offers and in the open market and has been
retired.   We also repaid $650,285,000 of existing property level debt
and completed $277,000,000 of property level financings.  In connection
with the above, we recognized an aggregate net loss of $25,915,000 from the
early extinguishment of debt on our consolidated statement of income.

Certain Future
Cash Requirements

Development and
Redevelopment Expenditures

We expended
$156,775,000 in 2010 to complete development projects.

On
October 1, 2010, Arlington County adopted a new Sector Plan for Crystal City
that provides for additional density and increased building heights which would
permit us to grow our assets in Crystal City from 8.0 million square
feet currently to as much as 11.5 million square feet

.

During 2010, we
entered into agreements with Cuyahoga County, Ohio (the “County”) to develop and
operate the Cleveland Medical Mart and Convention Center (the “Facility”), a
1,000,000 square foot showroom, trade show and conference center in Cleveland’s
central business district.  The County will fund the development of the
Facility, using proceeds from the issuance of general obligation bonds and other
sources, up to the development budget of $465,000,000 and maintain effective
control of the property.  During the 17-year development and operating
period, we will receive net settled payments of approximately $10,000,000 per
year, which is net of our $36,000,000 annual obligation to the County.  Our
obligation has been pledged by the County to the bondholders, but is payable by
us only to the extent that we first receive at least an equal payment from the
County.  We engaged a contractor to construct the Facility pursuant to a
guaranteed maximum price contract.  Although we are ultimately responsible
for cost overruns, the contractor is responsible for all costs incurred in
excess of its contract and has provided a completion guaranty. 
Construction of the Facility is expected to be completed in 2013. 
Subsequent thereto, we are required to fund $11,500,000, primarily for tenant
improvements, are responsible for all operating expenses and are entitled to the
net operating income, if any, of the Facility.  The County may terminate
the operating agreement five years from the completion of development and
periodically thereafter, if we fail to achieve certain performance
thresholds.  We plan to account for these agreements using criteria set
forth in ASC 605-25,

Multiple-Element Arrangements,

as we are
providing development, marketing, leasing, and other property management related
services over the 17-year term.  We plan to recognize development fees
using the percentage of completion method of accounting.

We are also
evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities for which final
plans, budgeted costs and financing have yet to be determined.  These
projects include the Springfield Mall in Springfield, Virginia and the Hotel
Pennsylvania and 220 Central Park South in Manhattan.

There can be no
assurance that any of our development projects will commence, or if commenced,
be completed on schedule or within budget.

Dividends

On January 12, 2011, we increased our quarterly common dividend to $0.69 per

common

share (an indicated annual rate of $2.76 per common share.  This dividend policy, if continued for all of 2011, would require us to pay out approximately $507,000,000 of cash for common share dividends.  In addition, during 2011, we expect to pay approximately $57,000,000 of cash dividends on outstanding preferred shares and approximately $53,000,000 of cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations

We believe that we have complied with the financial covenants required by our revolving credit facilities and our senior unsecured notes and that as of December 31, 2010 we have the ability to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness.  We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity securities and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a “well-known seasoned issuer.”

Our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

Insurance

We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, including coverage for terrorist acts, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods.  Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $150,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, up to

a

$150,000,000 annual aggregate.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by TRIPRA.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC.  Our coverage for NBCR losses is up to $2 billion per occurrence, for which PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and 15% of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of a covered loss.  We are ultimately responsible for any loss borne by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us.  However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space.  These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans.  As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $

263,178

,000.

At December 31, 2010, $12,198,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our revolving credit facilities.  Our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

We are committed to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $199,953,000, of which $146,622,000 is committed to our real estate Fund.  In addition, we have agreed in principle to contribute up to $52,000,000 to a new investment management fund which will be managed by LNR.

As part of the process of obtaining the required approvals to demolish and develop our 220 Central Park South property into a new residential tower, we have committed to fund the estimated project cost of

approximately $400,000,000 to $425,000,000.

Litigation

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including the matters referred to below, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (“USDC-NJ”) claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that a prior order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York dated February 6, 2001, as modified on appeal to the District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 13, 2001, froze our right to reallocate which effectively terminated our right to collect the additional rent from Stop & Shop. On March 3
, 2003, after we moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Stop & Shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint. On March 26, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a new complaint in New York State Supreme Court, asserting substantially the same claims as in its USDC-NJ complaint. We removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In January 2005 that court remanded the action to the New York State Supreme Court. On February 14, 2005, we served an answer in which we asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denyin
g the motions for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Court’s decision and on December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Court’s decision.  On January 16, 2007, we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Court’s decision which was denied on March 13, 2007.  Discovery is complete and a trial was held in November 2010, with closing arguments expected in March 2011.  We intend to continue to vigorously pursue our claims against Stop & Shop.

In July 2005, we acquired H Street Building Corporation (“H Street”) which has a subsidiary that owns, among other things, a 50% tenancy in common interest in land located in Arlington County, Virginia, known as "Pentagon Row," leased to two tenants, Street Retail, Inc. and Post Apartment Homes, L.P.  In April 2007, H Street acquired the remaining 50% interest in that fee.  On September 25, 2008, both tenants filed suit against us and the former owners claiming the right of first offer to purchase the fee interest, damages in excess of $75,000,000 and punitive damages.  In April 2010, the Trial Court entered judgment in favor of the tenants, that we sell the land to the tenants for a net sales price of $14,992,000, representing the Trial Court’s allocation of our purchase price for H Street.  The
 request for damages and punitive damages was denied.  As a result of the Trial Court’s decision, we recorded a $10,056,000 loss accrual in

the

first quarter of 2010.  We filed a motion to appeal the Trial Court’s decision, which the appeals court refused to hear.  Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2010, we sold the property to the tenants for $14,992,000 in cash (our reduced carrying amount) and reclassified the results of operations of this property to “(loss) income from discontinued operations,” and the related assets and liabilities to “assets related to discontinued operations” and “liabilities related to discontinued operations” for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Capital Expenditures

Our capital expenditures consist of expenditures to maintain assets, tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions.  Recurring capital improvements include expenditures to maintain a property’s competitive position within the market and tenant improvements and leasing commissions necessary to re-lease expiring leases or renew or extend existing leases.  Non-recurring capital improvements include expenditures completed in the year of acquisition and the following two years that were planned at the time of acquisition as well as tenant improvements and leasing commissions for space that was vacant at the time of acquisition of a property.  Our development and redevelopment expenditures include all hard and soft costs associated with the development or redevelopment of a property, including tenant improvements, leasing commissions, capitalized 
interest and operating costs until the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.

Below are the details of capital expenditures, leasing commissions and development and redevelopment expenditures and a reconciliation of total expenditures on an accrual basis to the cash expended in the year ended December 31, 2010.

Funds From Operations (“FFO”)

FFO is computed
in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines
FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of
depreciated real estate assets, depreciation and amortization expense from real
estate assets, extraordinary items and other specified non-cash items, including
the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries.  FFO
and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and analysts to
facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and
among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and
amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and
implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over
time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions.  FFO
does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not
necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should
not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or
cash flows as a liquidity measure.  FFO may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures employed by other companies.  The calculations of both the
numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are
disclosed in Note 16 –

Income per Share

, in the notes
to our consolidated financial statements on page 156 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

FFO attributable
to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $1,149,781,000, or $6.05 per
diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $583,596,000 or
$3.36 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2009. FFO attributable
to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $335,759,000 or $1.76 per
diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2010 compared to $20,000,
or $0.00 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2009. 
Details of certain items that affect comparability are discussed in the
financial results summary of our “Overview.”

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We have exposure
to fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are sensitive to
many factors that are beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest
rates on our consolidated and non-consolidated debt (all of which arises out of
non-trading activity) is as follows:

  us.

We may utilize
various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate
fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies,
depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and
risks of such strategies. As of December 31, 2010, variable rate debt with an
aggregate principal amount of $564,707,181 and a weighted average interest rate
of 2.84% was subject to LIBOR caps.  These caps are based on a notional
amount of $558,844,181 and cap LIBOR at a weighted average rate of 5.68%.

As of December
31, 2010, we have investments in mezzanine loans with an aggregate carrying
amount of $138,434,000 that are based on variable interest rates which partially
mitigate our exposure to a change in interest rates on our variable rate
debt.

Fair Value of Debt

The estimated
fair value of our consolidated debt is calculated based on current market prices
and discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be
made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such
debt.  As of December 31,  2010, the estimated fair value of our
consolidated debt was $11,190,189,000.

Derivative Instruments

We have, and may
in the future enter into, derivative positions that do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment, including our economic interest in J.C. Penney common
shares.  Because these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment, the gains or losses resulting from their mark-to-market at the end of
each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in “interest and
other investment income (loss), net” on our consolidated statements of income.
In addition, we are, and may in the future be, subject to additional expense
based on the notional amount of the derivative positions and a specified spread
over LIBOR. Because the market value of these instruments can vary significantly
between periods, we may experience significant fluctuations in the amount of our
investment income or expense in any given period. During the year ended December
31, 2010 we recognized $130,153,000 of income from derivative
instruments.

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Vornado Realty Trust (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income,
changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and
financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Vornado Realty Trust at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010,
based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2011 expressed an
unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.

VORNADO REALTY TRUST

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

2.    Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vornado and the Operating Partnership. All significant inter-company amounts have been eliminated. We account for unconsolidated partially owned entities on the equity method of accounting.  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Literature

In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an update to the guidance contained in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 310,

Receivables

.  The new guidance requires companies to provide more information about the credit quality of their financing receivables in the disclosures to financial statements including, but not limited to, significant purchases and sales of financing receivables, aging information and credit quality indicators. The adoption of this accounting guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

On January 21, 2010, the FASB issued an update to ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

, adding new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 fair value measurements and additional disclosures about the activity within Level 3 fair value measurements.  The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2010 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued an update to ASC 810,

Consolidation

, which modifies the existing quantitative guidance used in determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”) by requiring entities to qualitatively assess whether an enterprise is a primary beneficiary, based on whether the entity has (i) power over the significant activities of the VIE, and (ii) an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE.  The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2010 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Significant Accounting Policies

Real Estate:

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly related to the improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete. If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the undepreciated net book value of the property carried forward, exceeds the estimated fair value of re
developed property, the excess is charged to expense. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40 years. Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximate the useful lives of the assets. Additions to real estate include interest expense capitalized during construction of $864,000

and $17,256,000, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles such as acquired above and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and we allocate the purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions.

Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis.  An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared.  If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidate
d financial statements.  The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.  Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.  The table below summarizes non-cash impairment losses and acquisition costs recognized in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Partially Owned Entities:

In determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we have power over significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity. We have concluded that we do not control a partially owned entity if the entity is not con
sidered a variable interest entity and the approval of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect to major decisions, such as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange or other disposition of real property, the hiring of a chief executive officer, the commencement, compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or arbitration or the placement of new or additional financing secured by assets of the venture.  We account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions each period. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method.  Investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
 circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value.  Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared.

The table below summarizes non-cash impairment losses recognized on investments in partially owned entities in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Identified Intangibles:

We record acquired intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases, tenant relationships and acquired in-place leases) and acquired intangible liabilities (including below–market leases) at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. We amortize identified intangibles that have finite lives over the period they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of carrying amount of the identified intangible over its estimated fair v
alue.  As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets were $348,745,000

and $439,549,000, respectively. The carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of “deferred credit” on our consolidated balance sheets, were $528,905,000 and $606,390,000, respectively.

Mezzanine Loans Receivable:

We invest in mezzanine loans

of

entities

that

have significant real estate assets.  These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate.  We record these investments at the stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium. We accrete or amortize any discount or premium over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest method or straight-line method, if the result is not materially different.  We evaluate the collectability of both inte
rest and principal of each of our loans whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such amounts may not be recoverable. A loan is impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the estimated fair value of the loan or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  Interest on impaired loans is recognized when received in cash.  In the year ended December 31, 2009 we recorded a $190,738,000 loss accrual on our portfolio of mezzanine loans, $53,100,000 of which was reversed in 2010.  In 2008, upon sale of a sub-participation in a loan, we reversed $10,300,000 of a $57,000,000 loss accrual recognized in 2007.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks which may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit.  To date, we have not experienced any losses on our invested cash.

Restricted Cash:

Restricted cash consists of security deposits, cash restricted in connection with our deferred compensation plan and cash escrowed under loan agreements for debt service, real estate taxes, property insurance and capital improvements.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:

We periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents. This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates.  As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $62,979,000 and $46,708,000, respectively, in allowances for doubtful accounts.&nb
sp; In addition, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $7,323,000 and $4,672,000, respectively, in allowances for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents.

Deferred Charges:

Direct financing costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements as a component of interest expense. Direct costs related to successful leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the lives of the related leases. All other deferred charges are amortized on a straight line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, in accordance with the terms of the agreements to which they relate.

Stock-Based Compensation:

Stock-based compensation consists of awards to certain employees and officers and consists of stock options, restricted stock, restricted Operating Partnership units and out-performance plan awards.  We account for all stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,

Compensation – Stock Compensation

.

Revenue Recognition:

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:

•      Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.  We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use.  In addition, in circumstances in which we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

•      Percentage Rent — income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon tenant sales exceeding defined thresholds. These rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., when tenant sales thresholds have been achieved).

•      Hotel Revenue — income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue is recognized when the services have been rendered.

•      Trade Shows Revenue — income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred.

•      Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.

•      Management, Leasing and Other Fees – income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.

Condominium Units Held For Sale:

Condominium units held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or expected net sales proceeds.  As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, condominiums held for sale, which are included in “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheet, aggregate $84,397,000 and $187,050,000, respectively and consist of substantially completed units at our 40 East 66

th

Street property in Manhattan, The Bryant in Boston and Granite Park in Pasadena.  Revenue from condominium unit sales is recognized upon closing of the sale (the “completed contract method”), as all conditions for full profit recognition have been met at that time.  We use the relative sales value method to allocate costs to individual condominium units.&
nbsp; Net gains on sales of condominiums units are included in “net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets” on our consolidated statements of income.  In the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized non-cash impairment losses related to certain of these condominiums aggregating $30,013,000, $13,667,000 and $23,625,000, respectively, based on our assessments of the expected net sales proceeds associated with these condominium projects.  These losses are included in “impairment losses and acquisition costs” on our consolidated statements of income.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities:

ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, our derivative instruments consisted primarily of a portion of our investment in J.C. Penney common shares (see Note 4 – Marketable Securities and Derivative Instruments) and interest rate caps.  We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives 
depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings. We assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction. For derivatives not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognize
d in earnings.

Income Per Share:

Basic income per share is computed based on weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted income per share considers the effect of all potentially dilutive share equivalents, including outstanding employee stock options, restricted shares and convertible or redeemable securities.

Income Taxes:

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856‑860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to shareholders 100% of taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.  Dividends distributed for the year ended December 31, 2010, were characterized, for federal income tax income tax purposes, as 95.9% ordinary income, 2.8% as long term capital gain and 1.3% as return of capital.  Dividend dis
tributions for the year ended December 31, 2009, were characterized, for Federal income tax purposes, as 63.9% ordinary income, 0.9% long-term capital gain and 35.2% return of capital.  Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2008 were characterized, for Federal income tax purposes, as 70.8% ordinary income and 29.2% return of capital.

We have elected to treat certain consolidated subsidiaries, and may in the future elect to treat newly formed subsidiaries, as taxable REIT subsidiaries pursuant to an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code that became effective January 1, 2001.  Taxable REIT subsidiaries may participate in non-real estate related activities and/or perform non-customary services for tenants and are subject to Federal and State income tax at regular corporate tax rates. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries had a combined current income tax liability of approximately $24,858,000 and $20,025,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and have immaterial differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities.

In connection with purchase accounting for H Street, in July 2005 and April 2007 we recorded an aggregate of $222,174,000 of deferred tax liabilities representing the differences between the tax basis and the book basis of the acquired assets and liabilities multiplied by the effective tax rate.  We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of January 16, 2008, we had completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008.  Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, we reversed the deferred tax liabilities and recognized an income tax benefit of $222,174,000 in our consolidated statement of income.

Vornado Capital Partners, L.P. and Vornado Capital Partners Parallel, L.P. (the “Fund”)

On July 6, 2010, we completed an initial closing of the Fund with aggregate equity commitments of $550,000,000, of which we committed $200,000,000. We expect to close on an additional $250,000,000 of equity commitments in the first quarter of 2011.  We are the general partner and investment manager of the Fund and it is our exclusive investment vehicle during the three-year investment period for all investments that fit within the Fund’s investment parameters, including debt, equity and other interests in real estate, and excluding (i) investments in vacant land and ground-up development; (ii) investments acquired by merger or primarily for our securities or properties; (iii) properties which can be combined with or relate to our existing properties; (iv) securities of commercial mortgage loan servicers and investments derived from any such investments; (v) nonc
ontrolling interests in equity and debt securities; and (vi) investments located outside of North America.   The Fund has a term of eight years.  We consolidate the accounts of the Fund into our consolidated financial statements.  In 2010, we incurred $6,482,000 for organization costs of the Fund, net of the Fund’s reimbursement to us, which are included in “general and administrative” expenses on our consolidated statement of income.

The Fund is accounted for under the AICPA Investment Company Guide and its investments are reported on its balance sheet at fair value, with changes in value each period recognized in earnings.  As of December 31, 2010, the Fund received $146,789,000 of capital from partners, including $53,378,000 from us.  During the second half of 2010, the Fund made four investments aggregating approximately $145,000,000 and reimbursed us for $1,500,000 of organization costs.

On October 15, 2010, we acquired the 55% interest that we did not already own of a 646,000 square foot retail property located in San Jose, California, for $97,000,000, consisting of $27,000,000 in cash and $70,000,000 of existing debt.  We consolidate the accounts of the property into our consolidated financial statements from the date of this acquisition.

On November 4, 2010, we acquired 11.3 acres of the land under a portion of the Borgata Hotel and Casino complex for $83,000,000 in cash.  The land is leased to the partnership that controls the Borgata Hotel and Casino complex through December 2070.  In January 2011, we completed a 10-year $60,000,000 financing of this land.  The loan has a fixed interest rate of 5.14% and amortizes beginning in the third year, based on a 30-year schedule.

4.    Marketable Securities and Derivative Instruments

Marketable Securities

Our portfolio of marketable securities is comprised of debt and equity securities that are classified as available for sale.  Available for sale securities are presented on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value at the end of each reporting period.  Gains and losses resulting from the mark-to-market of these securities are recognized as an increase or decrease in “accumulated other comprehensive income” (a component of shareholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet) and not recognized in income.  Gains and losses are recognized in earnings only upon the sale of the securities and are recorded based on the weighted average cost of such securities.

We evaluate our portfolio of marketable securities for impairment each reporting period.  For each of the securities in our portfolio with unrealized losses, we review the underlying cause of the decline in value and the estimated recovery period, as well as the severity and duration of the decline.  In our evaluation, we consider our ability and intent to hold these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for us to recover our cost basis.  We also evaluate the near-term prospects for each of these investments in relation to the severity and duration of the decline.  During 2009 and 2008, we concluded that certain of our investments in marketable securities were “other-than-temporarily” impaired and recognized an aggregate of $3,361,000 and $76,352,000, respectively, of non-cash impairment losses.  These charges are in
cluded as a component of “interest and other investment income (loss), net” on our consolidated statements of income.  Our conclusions were based on the severity and duration of the decline in the market value of these securities and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near term.  No impairment losses were recognized in the year ended December 31, 2010.

The carrying amount of marketable securities classified as available for sale and their corresponding fair values at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 are as follows:

Investment in J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (“J.C. Penney”) (NYSE: JCP)

We own an economic interest in 23,400,000 J.C. Penney common shares, or 9.9% of J.C. Penney’s outstanding common shares.  Below are the details of our investment.

We own 18,584,010 common shares at an average price of $25.70 per share, or $477,678,000 in the aggregate.  These shares, which have an aggregate fair value of $600,449,000 at December 31, 2010, are included in marketable equity securities on our consolidated balance sheet and are classified as “available for sale.”  Of these shares, 15,500,000 were acquired through the exercise of a call option that originated on September 28, 2010 and settled on November 9, 2010.  During the period in which the call option was outstanding and classified as a derivative instrument, we recognized $112,537,000 of income from the mark-to-market of the underlying common shares, which is included in “interest and other investment income (loss), net” on our consolidated statement of income.  During the period from November 10 through December 31, 
2010, we recognized $10,234,000 from the mark-to-market of the common shares classified as available-for-sale, which is included in “accumulated other comprehensive income” (a component of shareholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet).

We also own an economic interest in 4,815,990 common shares through a forward contract executed on October 7, 2010, at a weighted average strike price of $28.65 per share, or $137,989,000 in the aggregate.  The contract may be settled, at our election, in cash or common shares, in whole or in part, at any time prior to October 9, 2012.  The counterparty may accelerate settlement, in whole or in part, upon one year’s notice to us.  The strike price per share increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 80 basis points and decreases for dividends received on the shares.  The contract is a derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  Mark-to-market adjustments on the underlying common shares are recognized in “interest and other investment income (loss), net” on our consolidated statement of income.&n
bsp; During the period from October 7, 2010 through December 31, 2010, we recognized $17,616,000 of income from the mark-to-market of this position, based on J.C.Penney’s closing share price of $32.31 per share at December 31, 2010.

As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate economic net gain on our investment in J.C. Penney was $140,387,000, based on J.C. Penney’s closing share price of $32.31 per share and our weighted average cost of $26.31 per share.

On July 29, 2010, as a part of LNR’s recapitalization, we acquired a 26.2% equity interest in LNR for $116,000,000 in cash and conversion into equity of our $15,000,000 mezzanine loan (the then current carrying amount) made to LNR’s parent, Riley Holdco Corp.  The recapitalization involved an infusion of a total of $417,000,000 in new cash equity and the reduction of LNR’s total debt to $425,000,000 from $1.3 billion, excluding liabilities related to the consolidated CMBS and CDO trusts described below. We account for our equity interest in LNR under the equity method on a one-quarter lag basis because we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to receiving LNR’s financial statements.

LNR consolidates certain commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) and Collateralized Debt Obligation (“CDO”) trusts for which it is the primary beneficiary.  The assets of these trusts (primarily commercial mortgage loans), which aggregate approximately $142 billion as of September 30, 2010, are the sole source of repayment of the related liabilities, which are non-recourse to LNR and its equity holders, including us.  Changes in the fair value of these assets each period are offset by changes in the fair value of the related liabilities through LNR’s consolidated income statement.  As of December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of our investment in LNR does not materially differ from our share of LNR’s equity.

Toys “R” Us (“Toys”)

As of December 31, 2010, we own 32.7% of Toys.  The business of Toys is highly seasonal.  Historically, Toys’ fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income.  We account for our investment in Toys under the equity method and record our 32.7% share of Toys net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because Toys’ fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, and our fiscal year ends on December 31.  As of December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of our investment in Toys does not differ materially from our share of the equity in the net assets of Toys on a purchase accounting basis.

On May 28, 2010, Toys filed a registration statement with the SEC for the offering and sale of its common stock.  The offering, if completed, would result in a reduction of our percentage ownership of Toys’ equity.  The size of the offering and its completion are subject to market and other conditions.  In August 2010, in connection with certain financing and refinancing transactions, Toys paid us an aggregate of $9,600,000 for our share of advisory fees.  Since Toys has capitalized these fees and is amortizing them over the term of the related debt, we recorded the fees as a reduction of the basis of our investment in Toys and will amortize the fees into income over the term of the related debt.

Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”) (NYSE: ALX)

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we owned 32.4%, respectively, of the outstanding common shares of Alexander’s.  We manage, lease and develop Alexander’s properties pursuant to the agreements described below which expire in March of each year and are automatically renewable.  At December 31, 2010 the market value (“fair value” pursuant to ASC 820) of our investment in Alexander’s, based on Alexander’s 2010 closing share price of $412.28, was $681,939,000, or $495,128,000

in excess of the carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet.

As of December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of our investment in Alexander’s excluding amounts owed to us, exceeds our share of the equity in the net assets of Alexander’s by approximately $59,823,000.

The majority of this basis difference resulted from the excess of our purchase price for the Alexander’s common stock acquired over the book value of Alexander’s net assets.  Substantially all of this basis difference was allocated, based on our estimates of the fair values of Alexande
r’s assets and liabilities, to real estate (land and buildings).  We are amortizing the basis difference related to the buildings into earnings as additional depreciation expense over their estimated useful lives.  This depreciation is not material to our share of equity in Alexander’s net income or loss.  The basis difference related to the land will be recognized upon disposition of our investment.

Management and Development Agreements

We receive an annual fee for managing Alexander’s and all of its properties equal to the sum of (i) $3,000,000, (ii) 3% of the gross income from the Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center, (iii) $0.50 per square foot of the tenant-occupied office and retail space at 731 Lexington Avenue and (iv) $248,000, escalating at 3% per annum, for managing the common area of 731 Lexington Avenue.

In addition, we are entitled to a development fee of 6% of development costs, as defined, with a minimum guaranteed payment of $750,000 per annum.  During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recognized $711,000,

$2,710,000 and $4,101,000, respectively, of development fee income.

Leasing Agreements

We provide Alexander’s with leasing services for a fee of 3% of rent for the first ten years of a lease term, 2% of rent for the eleventh through twentieth year of a lease term and 1% of rent for the twenty-first through thirtieth year of a lease term, subject to the payment of rents by Alexander’s tenants.  In the event third-party real estate brokers are used, our fee increases by 1% and we are responsible for the fees to the third-parties.  We are also entitled to a commission upon the sale of any of Alexander’s assets equal to 3% of gross proceeds, as defined, for asset sales less than $50,000,000, or 1% of gross proceeds, as defined, for asset sales of $50,000,000 or more.  The total of these amounts is payable to us in annual installments in an amount not to exceed $4,000,000 with interest on the unpaid balance
 at one-year LIBOR plus 1.0% (1.99% at December 31, 2010).

Other Agreements

Building Maintenance Services (“BMS”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, supervises the cleaning, engineering and security services at Alexander’s 731 Lexington Avenue and Kings Plaza properties for an annual fee of the costs for such services plus 6%.  During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized $2,775,000, $2,552,000 and $2,083,000 of income, respectively, under these agreements.

Lexington Realty Trust (“Lexington”) (NYSE: LXP)

As of December 31,

2010, we own 18,468,969 Lexington common shares, or approximately 12.8% of Lexington’s common equity.  We account for our investment in Lexington on the equity method because we believe we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Lexington’s operating and financial policies, based on, among other factors, our

representation on Lexington’s Board of Trustees and the level of our ownership in Lexington as compared to other shareholders.  We record our pro rata share of Lexington’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because we 
file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that Lexington files its financial statements.

Based on Lexington’s December 31, 2010

closing share price of $7.95, the market value (“fair value” pursuant to ASC 820) of our investment in Lexington was $146,828,000, or $89,558,000 in excess of the December 31, 2010 carrying amount on our consolidated balance

sheet.  As of December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of our investment in Lexington was less than our share of the equity in the net assets of Lexington by approximately

$63,871,000

.  This basis difference resulted primarily from $107,882,000 of non-cash impairment charges recognized during 2008, partially offset by purchase accounting for our acquisition of an additional 8,000,000 common shares of Lexington in October 2008, of which the majority relates to our estimate of the fair values of Lexington’s real estate (land and buildings) as compared to the carrying amounts in Lexington’s consolidated financial statements.  The basis difference related to the buildings is being amortized over their estimated useful lives as an adjustment to our equity in net income or loss of Lexington.  This amortization is not material to our share of equity in Lexington’s net income or loss.  The basis difference attributable to the land will be recognized upon disposition of our investment.

On October 20, 2010, we sold a 45% ownership interest in 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue (the Warner Building) and 1101 17

th

Street for $236,700,000, comprised of $91,000,000 in cash and the assumption of existing mortgage debt.  We retained the remaining 55% ownership interest and continue to manage and lease the properties.  Based on the Warner Building’s implied fair value of $445,000,000, we recognized a net gain of $54,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2010, which is included as a component of “net gains on dispositions of wholly owned and partially owned assets,” on our consolidated statement of income.  The gain on 1101 17

th

Street, based on an implied fair value of $81,000,000, will be recognized when we monetize our investment. We share control over

major

decisions with our joint venture partner.  Accordingly, these properties are accounted for under the equity method from the date of sale.

Accordingly, we account for this property under the equity method from the date of sale and no longer consolidate its accounts into our consolidated financial statements.

(2)

On October 15, 2010, we acquired the remaining 55% interest in this property for $97,000, consisting of $27,000 in cash and the assumption of $70,000 of existing debt.  Accordingly we consolidate the accounts of this property into our consolidated financial statements, from the date of acquisition.

Based on our ownership interest in the partially owned entities above, our pro rata share of the debt of these partially owned entities, was $40,443,346,000

and $3,149,640,000 as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.  Excluding our pro rata share of LNR’s liabilities related to consolidated CMBS and CDO trusts which are non-recourse to LNR and its equity holders, including us, our pro rata share of partially owned entities debt is $3,275,917,000

and $3,149,640,000 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

On June 16, 2006, we acquired an 81.5% interest in a $95,968 mezzanine loan to Tharaldson Lodging Companies for $78,166 in cash.  The loan is secured by a 107 hotel property portfolio with brands including Fairfield Inn, Residence Inn, Comfort Inn and Courtyard by Marriott.  The loan is subordinate to $671,778 of debt and is senior to approximately $192,000 of other debt and equity.  The loan provides for a 0.75% placement fee and bears interest at LIBOR plus 4.25% (4.56% at December 31, 2010).  The borrower has a one-year extension option.

(2)

On June 30, 2006, we made a $73,750 mezzanine loan secured by the equity interests in 280 Park Avenue, a 1.2 million square foot office building, located between 48th and 49th Streets in Manhattan.  The loan bears interest at 10.25% and matures in June 2016.  The loan is subordinate to $1.036 billion of other debt and is senior to approximately $260,000 of equity and interest reserves.

(3)

In January 2010, Equinox prepaid the entire balance of this loan which was scheduled to mature in February 2013.  We received $99,314, including accrued interest, for our 50% interest in the loan which we acquired in 2006 for $57,500.

(4)

Represents loan loss accruals on certain mezzanine loans based on our estimate of the net realizable value of each loan.  Our estimates are based on the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at each loan’s effective interest rate, or if a loan is collateralized, based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, adjusted for estimated costs to sell.  The excess of the carrying amount over the net realizable value of a loan is recognized as a reduction of “interest and other investment income (loss), net” in our consolidated statements of income.

7.    Discontinued Operations

In accordance with the provisions of ASC 360,

Property, Plant, and Equipment

, we have reclassified the revenues and expenses of properties and businesses sold or held for sale to “(loss) income from discontinued operations” and the related assets and liabilities to “assets related to discontinued operations” and “liabilities related to discontinued operations” for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  The net gains resulting from the sale of the properties below are included in “(loss) income from discontinued operations” on our consolidated statem
ents of income.

On January 12, 2011, we sold 1140 Connecticut Avenue and contracted to sell 1227 25

th

Street, subject to customary closing conditions, for an aggregate price of $127,000,000.  We will retain net proceeds of approximately $107,000,000, after repaying an existing mortgage and recognize a net gain of approximately $44,000,000 in the first quarter of 2011.

In December 2010, pursuant to a Court judgment, we sold the fee interest in land located in Arlington County, Virginia,  known as Pentagon Row, to the tenants for an aggregate of $14,992,000 in cash.  See

Litigation,

in Note 19 -  Commitments and Contingencies, for further details.

In March 2010, we ceased making debt service payments on the mortgage loan secured by the Cannery, a retail property in California as a result of insufficient cash flow, and the loan went into default.  On October 14, 2010, the special servicer foreclosed on the property, and the property and related debt were removed from our consolidated balance sheet.

In March 2010, we ceased making debt service payments on the mortgage loan secured by the High Point Complex in North Carolina as a result of insufficient cash flow and the loan went into default.  In November 2010, the property was placed in receivership.  While the receivership process is inherently lengthy, we anticipate that the property will be sold in the first half of 2011, at which time the assets and liabilities will be removed from our consolidated balance sheet and we will recognize a net gain of approximately $80,000,000.

On September 1, 2009, we sold 1999 K Street, a newly developed 250,000 square foot office building, in Washington’s Central Business District, for $207,800,000 in cash which resulted in a net gain of approximately $41,211,000.

In 2009, we sold 15 retail properties in separate transactions for an aggregate of $55,000,000 in cash which resulted in net gains aggregating $4,073,000.

On June 10, 2008, we sold our Tysons Dulles Plaza office building complex for $152,800,000 in cash which resulted in a net gain of $56,831,000.

On March 31, 2008, we sold our 47.6% interest in Americold, our Temperature Controlled Logistics segment for $220,000,000 in cash which resulted in a net gain of $112,690,000.

Notes to preceding tabular information (Amounts in thousands):

(1)

Represents the extended maturity for certain loans in which we have the unilateral right, ability and intent to extend.  In the case of our convertible and exchangeable debt, represents the earliest date holders may require us to repurchase the debentures.

(2)

On February 11, 2011, we completed a $425,000 refinancing of this loan.  The seven-year loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%, which was swapped for this term of the loan to a fixed rate of 5.13%.  The loan amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the fourth year.  We retained net proceeds of approximately $139,000, after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.

(3)

On October 20, 2010, we sold a 45% ownership interest in this property to a joint venture and share control over major decisions with our joint venture partner.  Accordingly, we account for this property under the equity method of accounting and no longer consolidate its accounts into our consolidated financial statements.

(4)

On June 1, 2010, we refinanced this loan.  The new loan, which is guaranteed by the Operating Partnership, has a rate of LIBOR plus 1.40% (1.66% at December 31, 2010) and matures in June 2011 with three one-year extension options.

(5)

On September 1, 2010, we repaid the $44,900 outstanding balance of this loan which was scheduled to mature in October 2010.

(6)

In August 2010, we sold $660,000 of 10-year mortgage notes in a single issuer securitization.  The notes are comprised of a $600,000 fixed rate component and a $60,000 variable rate component and are cross-collateralized by 40 of our strip shopping centers. The variable rate portion of the debt has a LIBOR floor of 1.00%.

(7)

In December 2010, we acquired this loan, which had an outstanding balance of $171,500, for $115,000 in cash.  In a separate transaction, we acquired our partner’s interest in the partnership that owns the mall for $25,000 in Operating Partnership units.  These transactions resulted in a net gain on early extinguishment of debt of $102,932 in our consolidated statement of income.

(8)

Notes to preceding tabular information (Amounts in thousands):

(14)

In October 2010, we repaid a $36,000 loan which matured on September 30, 2010.

(15)

On March 26, 2010, we completed a public offering of $500,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due April 1, 2015.  Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually commencing on October 1, 2010.  The notes were sold at 99.834% of their face amount to yield 4.287%.  The notes can be redeemed without penalty beginning January 1, 2015.  We retained net proceeds of approximately $496,000.

(16)

These notes may be redeemed at our option in whole or in part beginning on October 1, 2014, at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued interest.  In 2010, we reclassified $13,866 of deferred financing costs to “deferred leasing and financing costs” on our consolidated balance sheet.

(17)

In the third quarter of 2010, we purchased $17,000 aggregate face amount ($16,981 aggregate carrying amount) of these senior unsecured notes for $17,382 in cash, resulting in a net loss of $401 and in February 2011, upon maturity, we repaid the $100,000 balance of these notes.

(18)

In 2010, we purchased $68,418 aggregate face amount ($66,916 aggregate carrying amount) of our convertible senior debentures for $68,804 in cash, resulting in a net loss of $1,888.

(19)

On October 1 2010, pursuant to our September 2, 2010 tender offer, we purchased $189,827 aggregate face amount of our 3.63% convertible senior debentures and $12,246 aggregate face amount of our 2.85% convertible senior debentures for an aggregate of $206,053 in cash, resulting in a net loss of $8,493.

(20)

The net proceeds from the offering of these debentures were contributed to the Operating Partnership in the form of an inter-company loan and the Operating Partnership fully and unconditionally guaranteed payment of these debentures.  There are no restrictions which limit the Operating Partnership from making distributions to Vornado and Vornado has no independent assets or operations outside of the Operating Partnership.

10.    Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Redeemable noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheets represent Operating Partnership units held by third parties and are comprised of Class A units and Series D-10, D-11, D-14, D-15 and D-16 (collectively, “Series D”) cumulative redeemable preferred units.  Class A units of the Operating Partnership may be tendered for redemption to the Operating Partnership for cash; we, at our option, may assume that obligation and pay the holder either cash or Vornado common shares on a one-for-one basis.  Because the number of Vornado common shares outstanding at all times equals the number of Class A units owned by Vornado, the redemption value of each Class A unit is equivalent to the market value of one Vornado common share, and the quarterly distribution to a Class A unitholder is equal to the quarterly dividend paid to a Vornado common sh
areholder.  Below are the details of Operating Partnership units held by third-parties that are included in “redeemable noncontrolling interests” as of December 31, 2010 and 2009:

12.  Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures

defines fair value and establishes a framework for
measuring fair value.  The objective of fair value is to determine the
price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date (the exit price).

ASC 820
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable
inputs used to measure fair value into three levels: Level 1 – quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for
assets or liabilities; Level 2 – observable prices that are based on inputs not
quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3 –
unobservable inputs that are used when little or no market data is available.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the
lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize
valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the
use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider
counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value.  Considerable
judgment is necessary to interpret Level 2 and 3 inputs in determining the fair
value of our financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. 
Accordingly, our fair value estimates, which are made at the end of each
reporting period, may be different than the amounts that may ultimately be
realized upon sale or disposition of these assets.

Fair Value
Measurements on a Recurring Basis

Financial assets
and liabilities that are measured at fair value in our consolidated financial
statements consist of (i) marketable securities, (ii) derivative positions in
marketable equity securities (iii) the assets of our deferred compensation plan,
which are primarily marketable equity securities and equity investments in
limited partnerships, (iv) Real Estate Fund investments, (v) short-term
investments (CDARS classified as available-for-sale), and (vi) mandatorily
redeemable instruments (Series G convertible preferred units and Series D-13
cumulative redeemable preferred units).  The tables below aggregate the
fair values of financial assets and liabilities by the levels in the fair value
hierarchy at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Fair Value Measurements on a Nonrecurring Basis

Non-financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in our consolidated financial statements consist of real estate assets and investments in partially owned entities that have been written-down to estimated fair value during 2010 and 2009.  See Note 2 –

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

for details of impairment losses recognized during 2010 and 2009.  The fair values of these assets are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including (i) discounted cash flow analysis, which considers, among other things, leasing assumptions, growth rates, discount rates and terminal capitalization rates, (ii) income capitalization approach, which consid
ers prevailing market capitalization rates and (iii) comparable sales activity.  In general, we consider multiple valuation techniques when measuring fair values.  However, in certain circumstances, a single valuation technique may be appropriate.  The tables below aggregate the fair values of these assets by the levels in the fair value hierarchy.

13.    Stock-based
Compensation

On May 13, 2010,
our shareholders approved the 2010 Omnibus Share Plan (the “Plan’), which
replaces the 2002 Omnibus Share Plan.  Under the Plan, the Compensation
Committee of the Board (the “Committee”) may grant eligible participants awards
of stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, restricted
shares and other stock-based awards and operating partnership units, certain of
which may provide for dividends or dividend equivalents and voting rights prior
to vesting.  Awards may be granted up to a maximum of 6,000,000 shares, if
all awards granted are Full Value Awards, as defined, and up to 12,000,000
shares, if all of the awards granted are Not Full Value Awards, as
defined.  Full Value Awards are awards of securities, such as restricted
shares, that, if all vesting requirements are met, do not require the payment of
an exercise price or strike price to acquire the securities.  Not Full
Value Awards are awards of securities, such as options, that do require the
payment of an exercise price or strike price.  This means, for example, if
the Committee were to award only restricted shares, it could award up to
6,000,000 restricted shares.  On the other hand, if the Committee were to
award only stock options, it could award options to purchase up to 12,000,000
shares (at the applicable exercise price).  The Committee may also issue
any combination of awards under the Plan, with reductions in availability of
future awards made in accordance with the above limitations.

The Plan
provides for grants of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted
stock, restricted Operating Partnership units and out-performance plan
awards.  As of December 31, 2010, we have approximately 5,942,000 shares
available for future grants under the Plan, if all awards granted are Full Value
Awards, as defined.

In the third
quarter of 2010, we recognized $2,800,000 of expense resulting from accelerating
the vesting of certain Operating Partnership units and 2006 out-performance plan
units, which were scheduled to fully vest in the first quarter of 2011.  In
the first quarter of 2009, our nine most senior executives voluntarily
surrendered their 2008 out-performance plan awards and their 2007 and 2008 stock
option awards resulting in $32,588,000 of expense, representing the write-off of
the unamortized portion of these awards, which is included in “general and
administrative expenses” on our consolidated statement of income.

Out-Performance
Plans

On March 31,
2008, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Trustees approved a $75,000,000
out-performance plan (the “2008 OPP”).  Under the 2008 OPP, the total
return to our shareholders (the “Total Return”) resulting from both share
appreciation and dividends for the four-year period from March 31, 2008 to March
31, 2012 must exceed both an absolute and a relative hurdle.  The initial
value from which to determine the Total Return is $86.20 per share, a 0.93%
premium to the trailing 10-day average closing price on the New York Stock
Exchange for our common shares on the date the plan was adopted.  During
the four-year performance period, participants are entitled to receive 10% of
the common dividends paid on Vornado’s common shares for each 2008 OPP unit
awarded, regardless of whether the units are ultimately earned.  The fair
value of the 2008 OPP awards on the date of grant, as adjusted for estimated
forfeitures, was approximately $21,600,000, and is being amortized into expense
over a five-year period beginning on the date of grant through the final vesting
period, using a graded vesting attribution model, with the exception of an
aggregate of $13,722,000 which was accelerated into expense in the first quarter
of 2009 as a result of the voluntary surrender of such awards discussed
above.

On April 25,
2006, our Compensation Committee approved a $100,000,000 Out-performance plan
(the “2006 OPP”), under which 91% of the total Out-Performance Plan was
awarded.  The fair value of the awards on the date of grant, as adjusted
for estimated forfeitures, was approximately $46,141,000 and is being amortized
into expense over the five-year vesting period beginning on the date of grant,
using a graded vesting attribution model.   As of January 12, 2007,
the maximum performance threshold under the Out-Performance Plan was achieved,
concluding the performance period.

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
2008, we recognized $5,062,000, $23,493,000 and $16,021,000 of compensation
expense, respectively, for these plans.  As of December 31, 2010, there was
$1,250,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related these plans, which
will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.47 years. 
Distributions paid on unvested OPP Units are charged to “net income attributable
to noncontrolling interests” on our consolidated statements of income and
amounted to $815,000, $1,935,000 and $2,918,000 in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively

Stock Options

Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to 100% of the average of the high and low market price of our common shares on the NYSE on the date of grant, generally vest pro-rata over four years and expire 10 years from the date of grant.  Compensation expense related to stock option awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with the exception of an aggregate of $18,866,000 which was accelerated into expense in the first quarter of 2009 as a result of voluntary surrenders.  During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized $7,916,000, $25,911,000 and $9,051,000, of compensation expense, respectively, for these options.  As of December 31, 2010 there was $17,606,000

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.

18. 
Leases

As lessor:

We lease space to tenants under operating leases.
Most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base rentals payable monthly
in advance.  Office building leases generally require the tenants to
reimburse us for operating costs and real estate taxes above their base year
costs.  Shopping center leases provide for pass-through to tenants the
tenant’s share of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance.  Shopping
center leases also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rent
based on a percentage of the tenants’ sales.  As of December 31, 2010,
future base rental revenue under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding
rents for leases with an original term of less than one year and rents resulting
from the exercise of renewal options, is as follows:

(Amounts in thousands)

Year Ending December 31:

1,693,000


1,568,000


1,446,000


1,258,000

Thereafter

6,206,000

These amounts do not include rentals based on
tenants’ sales.  These percentage rents approximated $8,534,000, $9,051,000
and $7,322,000, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of
total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
2008.

Former Bradlees Locations

Pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty,
dated May 1, 1992, we are due $5,000,000 per annum of additional rent from Stop
& Shop which was allocated to certain Bradlees former locations.  On
December 31, 2002, prior to the expiration of the leases to which the additional
rent was allocated, we reallocated this rent to other former Bradlees leases
also guaranteed by Stop & Shop.  Stop & Shop is contesting our
right to reallocate and claims that we are no longer entitled to the additional
rent.  At December 31, 2010, we were due an aggregate of $40,417,000. 
We believe the additional rent provision of the guaranty expires, at the
earliest, in 2012, and we are vigorously contesting Stop & Shop’s
position.

We are also a lessee under capital leases for real
estate.  Lease terms generally range from 5-20 years with renewal or
purchase options.  Capitalized leases are recorded at the present value of
future minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the property. 
Capitalized leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated
life of the asset or life of the related lease, whichever is shorter. 
Amortization expense on capital leases is included in “depreciation and

Insurance

We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, including coverage for terrorist acts, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods.  Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $150,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, up to a $150,000,000 annual aggregate.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) acts, as defined by TRIPRA.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC.  Our coverage for NBCR losses is up to $2 billion per occurrence, for which PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and 15% of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of a covered loss.  We are ultimately responsible for any loss borne by PPIC.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us.  However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space.  These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans.  As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $

263,178

,000.

At December 31, 2010, $12,198,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our revolving credit facilities.  Our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

We are committed to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $199,953,000, of which $146,622,000 is committed to

our real estate

Fund.  In addition, we have agreed in principle to contribute up to $52,000,000 to a new investment management fund which will be managed by LNR.

As part of the process of obtaining the required approvals to demolish and develop our 220 Central Park South property into a new residential tower, we have committed to fund the estimated project cost of

approximately $400,000,000 to $425,000,000.

19.    Commitments and Contingencies - continued

During 2010, we entered into agreements with Cuyahoga County, Ohio (the “County”) to develop and operate the Cleveland Medical Mart and Convention Center (the “Facility”), a 1,000,000 square foot showroom, trade show and conference center in Cleveland’s central business district.  The County will fund the development of the Facility, using proceeds from the issuance of general obligation bonds and other sources, up to the development budget of $465,000,000 and maintain effective control of the property.  During the 17-year development and operating period, we will receive net settled payments of approximately $10,000,000 per year, which is net of our $36,000,000 annual obligation to the County.  Our obligation has been pledged by the County to the bondholders, but is payable by us only to the extent that we first receive at l
east an equal payment from the County.  We engaged a contractor to construct the Facility pursuant to a guaranteed maximum price contract.  Although we are ultimately responsible for cost overruns, the contractor is responsible for all costs incurred in excess of its contract and has provided a completion guaranty.  Construction of the Facility is expected to be completed in 2013.  Subsequent thereto, we are required to fund $11,500,000, primarily for tenant improvements, are responsible for all operating expenses and are entitled to the net operating income, if any, of the Facility.  The County may terminate the operating agreement five years from the completion of development and periodically thereafter, if we fail to achieve certain performance thresholds.  We plan to account for these agreements using criteria set forth in ASC 605-25,

Multiple-Element Arrangements,

as we are providing development, marketing, leasing, and other property management related services over the 17-year term.  We plan to recognize development fees using the percentage of completion method of accounting.

Litigation

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including the matters referred to below, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (“USDC-NJ”) claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that a prior order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York dated February 6, 2001, as modified on appeal to the District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 13, 2001, froze our right to reallocate which effectively terminated our right to collect the additional rent from Stop & Shop. On March 3,
 2003, after we moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Stop & Shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint. On March 26, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a new complaint in New York State Supreme Court, asserting substantially the same claims as in its USDC-NJ complaint. We removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In January 2005 that court remanded the action to the New York State Supreme Court. On February 14, 2005, we served an answer in which we asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying
 the motions for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Court’s decision and on December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Court’s decision.  On January 16, 2007, we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Court’s decision which was denied on March 13, 2007.  Discovery is complete and a trial was held in November 2010, with closing arguments expected in March 2011.  We intend to continue to vigorously pursue our claims against Stop & Shop.

In July 2005, we acquired H Street Building Corporation (“H Street”) which has a subsidiary that owns, among other things, a 50% tenancy in common interest in land located in Arlington County, Virginia, known as "Pentagon Row," leased to two tenants, Street Retail, Inc. and Post Apartment Homes, L.P.  In April 2007, H Street acquired the remaining 50% interest in that fee.  On September 25, 2008, both tenants filed suit against us and the former owners claiming the right of first offer to purchase the fee interest, damages in excess of $75,000,000 and punitive damages.  In April 2010, the Trial Court entered judgment in favor of the tenants, that we sell the land to the tenants for a net sales price of $14,992,000, representing the Trial Court’s allocation of our purchase price for H Street.  The request for damage
s and punitive damages was denied. As a result of the Trial Court’s decision, we recorded a $10,056,000 loss accrual in

the

first quarter of 2010.  We filed a motion to appeal the Trial Court’s decision, which the appeals court refused to hear.  Accordingly

,

in the fourth quarter of 2010, we sold the property to the tenants for $14,992,000 in cash (our reduced carrying amount) and  reclassified the results of operations of this property to “(loss) income from discontinued operations,” and the related assets and liabilities to “assets related to discontinued operations” and “liabilities related to discontinued operations” for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees

Alexander’s

We own 32.4% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President and Chief Executive Officer, are officers and directors of Alexander’s.  We provide various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements.  These agreements are described in Note 5 - Investments in Partially Owned Entities.

On March 2, 2009, Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli each exercised 150,000 stock appreciation rights which were scheduled to expire on March 4, 2009 and each received gross proceeds of $11,419,000.

Interstate Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr. Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s, are Interstate’s two other partners. As of December 31, 2010, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned approximately 7.0% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 27.2% of Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on


days’ notice at the end of the term. We believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies, that the management agreement terms are fair to us. We earned $815,000, $782,000, and $803,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

22.    Segment Information - continued

Notes to preceding tabular information:

(1)

EBITDA represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization."  We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)

Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax expense in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these items from partially owned entities.

(3)

The components of other EBITDA are summarized below.  The totals for each of the columns below agree to the total EBITDA for the "other" column in the preceding EBITDA by segment reconciliations.

item 9.                changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure

None.

Item 9A.              Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures:  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a‑15 (e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:  There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of Vornado Realty Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As of December 31, 2010, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 was effective.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our trustees; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 168, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board of Trustees

Vornado Realty Trust

New York, New York

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Vornado Realty Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal 
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of trustees, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit pre
paration of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.
