ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

NiSource Inc.

NiSource is an energy holding company whose subsidiaries provide natural gas, electricity and other
products and services to approximately 3.8 million customers located within a corridor that runs
from the Gulf Coast through the Midwest to New England. NiSource is the successor to an Indiana
corporation organized in 1987 under the name of NIPSCO Industries, Inc., which changed its name to
NiSource Inc. on April 14, 1999. In connection with the acquisition of Columbia on November 1,
2000, NiSource became a Delaware corporation registered under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935. Effective February 8, 2006, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was
repealed. NiSource is now a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005.

NiSource is the largest natural gas distribution company operating east of the Rocky Mountains, as
measured by number of customers. NiSource’s principal subsidiaries include Columbia, a
vertically-integrated natural gas distribution, transmission and storage holding company whose
subsidiaries provide service to customers in the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast;
Northern Indiana, a vertically-integrated gas and electric company providing service to customers
in northern Indiana; and Bay State, a natural gas distribution company serving customers in New
England. NiSource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating
results of its 15 direct subsidiaries.

NiSource’s business segments are: Gas Distribution Operations; Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations; Electric Operations; and Other Operations.

Gas Distribution Operations

NiSource’s natural gas distribution operations serve more than 3.3 million customers in nine states
and operate approximately 58 thousand miles of pipeline. Through its wholly owned subsidiary,
Columbia, NiSource owns five distribution subsidiaries that provide natural gas to approximately
2.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia,
Kentucky and Maryland. NiSource also distributes natural gas to approximately 792 thousand
customers in northern Indiana through three subsidiaries: Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and
Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Additionally, NiSource’s subsidiaries Bay State and Northern
Utilities distribute natural gas to approximately 340 thousand customers in Massachusetts, Maine
and New Hampshire.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations

NiSource’s Gas Transmission and Storage Operations subsidiaries own and operate approximately 16
thousand miles of interstate pipelines and operate one of the nation’s largest underground natural
gas storage systems capable of storing approximately 637 Bcf of natural gas. Through its
subsidiaries, Columbia Transmission, Columbia Gulf, Crossroads Pipeline and Granite State Gas,
NiSource owns and operates an interstate pipeline network extending from offshore in the Gulf of
Mexico to Lake Erie, New York and the eastern seaboard. Together, these companies serve customers
in 19 northeastern, mid-Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The
Gas Transmission and Storage Operations subsidiaries are engaged in several projects that will
expand their facilities and throughput. The largest such project is the Millennium Pipeline, which
received FERC approval in December 2006. The reconfigured project will begin at an interconnect
with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly
towards Syracuse, New York. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with
Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium will extend eastward to an interconnect with
Algonquin Gas Transmission Co. at Ramapo, New York. Another project is Hardy Storage, a Columbia
Transmission partnership to develop a storage field in West Virginia to provide additional natural
gas storage for the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission held an open season for an
additional project, the Eastern Market Expansion Project, and has signed precedent agreements with
four East Coast customers. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate
regulatory applications during 2007.

Electric Operations

NiSource generates, transmits and distributes electricity through its subsidiary Northern Indiana
to approximately 454 thousand customers in 21 counties in the northern part of Indiana and engages
in wholesale and transmission transactions. Northern Indiana owns and has the ability to operate
four coal-fired electric generating stations with a net capability of 3,059 mw, six gas-fired
generating units with a net capability of 323 mw and two hydroelectric generating plants with a net
capability of 10 mw. These facilities provide for a total system net capability of 3,392 mw.
Northern Indiana’s transmission system, with voltages from 34,500 to 345,000 volts, consists of
3,192 circuit miles. Northern Indiana is interconnected with five neighboring electric utilities.



ITEM 1.

BUSINESS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Northern Indiana currently operates three coal-fired generation stations with a net capacity of
2,574 mw, six gas-fired generating units with a net capacity of 323 mw and two hydroelectric plants
with a net capability of 10 mw, totaling a net capability of 2,907 mw. During the year ended
December 31, 2006, Northern Indiana generated 81.1% and purchased 18.9% of its electric
requirements. Northern Indiana’s Mitchell Station, indefinitely shut down in 2002, is not included
in the net capacity of the three coal-fired generation stations. Northern Indiana’s generating
requirements are currently under review. Northern Indiana’s Integrated Resource Plan, filed with
the IURC in November 2005, indicated a gap between customer demand projections and company owned
generating capability, primarily in peak hours during the summer.

Other Operations

The Other Operations segment participates in energy-related services including gas marketing, power
and gas risk management and ventures focused on distributed power generation technologies,
including a cogeneration facility, fuel cells and storage systems. PEI operates the Whiting Clean
Energy project at BP’s Whiting, Indiana refinery, which is a 525 mw cogeneration facility that uses
natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and also provides steam for
industrial use. Additionally, the Other Operations segment is involved in real estate and other
businesses.

Divestiture of Non-Core Assets

In recent years, NiSource sold certain businesses judged to be non-core to NiSource’s strategy.
Lake Erie Land, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, has sold and is in the process of selling
certain real estate, which included its Sand Creek Golf Club assets, which were sold in June 2006,
to a private real estate developer. In addition, NDC Douglas Properties, a subsidiary of NiSource
Development Company, is in the process of exiting its low income housing investments.

Business Strategy

NiSource focuses its business strategy on its core, rate-regulated asset-based businesses with
virtually 100% of its operating income generated from the rate-regulated businesses. With the
nation’s fourth largest natural gas pipeline, the largest natural gas distribution network east of
the Rocky Mountains and one of the nation’s largest natural gas storage networks, NiSource operates
throughout the energy-intensive corridor that extends from the supply areas in the Gulf Coast
through the consumption centers in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, New England and Northeast. This
corridor includes over 40% of the nation’s population and close to 50% of its natural gas
consumption. NiSource continues to position its assets to meet the corridor’s growing energy
needs.

Financial and Strategic Review

NiSource’s senior management and Board are continuing the strategic and financial review process
initiated during 2006 to unlock the underlying value of the company’s asset base and position it
for the future. NiSource expects to be in a position to communicate the results of this process
early in 2007.

Competition and Changes in the Regulatory Environment

The regulatory frameworks applicable to NiSource’s operations, at both the state and federal
levels, continue to evolve. These changes have had and will continue to have an impact on
NiSource’s operations, structure and profitability. Management continually seeks new ways to be
more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including providing gas customers
with increased choices for products and services.

Natural Gas Competition.

Open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the
deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets. LDC
customers and marketers began to purchase gas directly from producers and marketers and an open,
competitive market for gas supplies has emerged. This separation or “unbundling” of the
transportation and other services offered by pipelines and LDC’s allows customers to purchase the
commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and LDC’s. The LDC’s continue to
purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers. NiSource’s Gas Distribution
Operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to
purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use the NiSource Gas Distribution
Operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services.



ITEM 1.

BUSINESS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Electric Competition.

In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the
formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate
pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. In compliance with the
rule, Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO
on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access
Transmission Tariff. On April 1, 2005, MISO implemented an electric energy market following
approved FERC tariffs. Northern Indiana currently sells all power from its plants into this
market.

NiSource’s Other Operations subsidiaries also experience competition for energy sales and related
services from third party providers. NiSource meets these challenges through innovative programs
aimed at providing energy products and services at competitive prices while also providing new
services that are responsive to the evolving energy market and customer requirements.

Financing Subsidiary

NiSource Finance is a wholly-owned, consolidated finance subsidiary of NiSource that engages in
financing activities to raise funds for the business operations of NiSource and its subsidiaries.
NiSource Finance was incorporated in February 2000 under the laws of the state of Indiana.
NiSource Finance’s obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NiSource.

Other Relevant Business Information

NiSource’s customer base is broadly diversified, with no single customer accounting for a
significant portion of revenues.

As of December 31, 2006, NiSource had 7,439 employees of whom 3,383 were subject to collective
bargaining agreements.

For a listing of certain subsidiaries of NiSource refer to Exhibit 21.

NiSource files various reports with the SEC. The reports include the annual report on Form 10-K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed
or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. NiSource
makes all SEC filings available without charge to the public on its web site at

http://www.nisource.com

.



ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

NiSource Inc.

There are many factors that could have a material adverse effect on NiSource’s operating results,
financial condition and cash flows. New risks may emerge at any time, and NiSource cannot predict
those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance. Each of the
risks described below could adversely impact the value of NiSource’s securities.

NiSource has substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect its financial condition.

NiSource has a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding as a result of the acquisition of
Columbia. NiSource had total consolidated indebtedness of $6,432.5 million outstanding as of
December 31, 2006. The substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors.
For example, it could:

Some of NiSource’s debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debt-to-capital ratios
and cross-default provisions. NiSource’s failure to comply with any of these covenants could
result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of
outstanding debt obligations.

NiSource’s costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant. The costs of compliance
with future environmental laws and the incurrence of environmental liabilities could impact cash
flow and profitability.

NiSource’s subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental
requirements that, among other things, regulate air emissions, water usage and discharges,
remediation and the management of chemicals, hazardous waste and solid waste. Compliance with
these legal requirements requires NiSource to commit significant expenditures for installation of
pollution control equipment, remediation, environmental monitoring, emissions fees and permits at
many of NiSource’s facilities. These expenditures are significant, and NiSource expects that they
will continue to be significant in the future.

If NiSource’s subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to
the environment or persons, even if caused by factors beyond NiSource’s control, that failure or
harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against NiSource and
its subsidiaries. In September 2004, the EPA issued an NOV to Northern Indiana alleging violations
of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require capital expenditures beyond the EPA requirements that cannot be determined at this time and
could require payment of substantial penalties.

Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised, and new laws and regulations seeking to
protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to NiSource’s subsidiaries. Revised or
additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating
restrictions on NiSource’s facilities or increased compliance costs, which may not be fully
recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income. The cost impact of any new or
amended legislation would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at
this time.



ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

A significant portion of the gas and electricity NiSource sells is used by residential and
commercial customers for heating and air conditioning. Accordingly, the operating results
fluctuate depending on the weather and, to a certain extent, usage of gas or electricity.

Energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather. Forecasts of energy sales are based on normal
weather, which represents a long-term historical average. Significant variations from normal
weather could have, and have had, a material impact on energy sales. Additionally, residential
usage, and to some degree commercial usage, have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity
costs for gas and electricity, whereby usage declines with increased energy costs, thus affecting
NiSource’s financial results.

NiSource’s electric operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries.

Electric operations in northern Indiana have been and may continue to be adversely affected by
events in the steel and steel related industries. In particular, sales to large industrial
customers in these industries have been impacted by economic downturns generally, and may be
affected by consolidation and globalization within such industries.

The majority of NiSource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the
impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings.

Virtually all of NiSource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal
or state level. As such, the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to
regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority. These rate reviews determine the
energy rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues. As part of a settlement reached in
other regulatory proceedings, Northern Indiana has agreed to file an electric base rate case with
the IURC on or before July 1, 2008. The outcome for the rate case could have a material effect on
NiSource’s financial results.

NiSource’s recent outsourcing initiative and service agreement with IBM may not achieve the level
of savings that was originally anticipated. Additionally, many associated changes in systems and
personnel are being made, increasing operational and control risk during transition, which may have
an impact on the business and its financial condition.

NiSource’s original expectation of the 10-year agreement with IBM was to deliver upwards of $530
million in gross savings in operating and capital costs. This cost savings is dependent upon many
factors, and unanticipated changes in operations may cause actual cost savings to be substantially
less than expected. Many functions have recently been transitioned to IBM and many new personnel
have assumed responsibilities across these functions, increasing the risk of operational delays,
potential errors and control failures which may have an impact on NiSource and its financial
condition.

As a part of this transformation, many new information technology systems and process changes have
an accelerated time-line for completion, increasing the risk of operational delays, potential
errors and control failures which may have an impact on NiSource and its financial condition. In
August, 2006, NiSource and IBM decided to delay further implementation of certain information
technology systems due to difficulties encountered with the first wave of new system
implementations. This delay may decrease the level of projected operating cost savings while
continuing to ensure stable operations. NiSource is currently engaged in an overall assessment of
the outsourcing initiative primarily to focus on operational and transformational improvements and
develop an integrated plan that enables NiSource to achieve its business objectives going forward.

NiSource’s Whiting merchant energy project is operating at a loss.

NiSource owns and operates a merchant energy facility, Whiting Clean Energy, at BP’s Whiting,
Indiana refinery. This facility uses natural gas to generate electricity for sale in the wholesale
markets and to generate steam for industrial use by BP’s refinery. In the fourth quarter of 2006,
NiSource reached a new definitive agreement with BP redefining the terms under which Whiting Clean
Energy will provide steam to BP. The profitability of this facility will remain dependant upon the
market prices for electricity and natural gas and regional load dispatch patterns. The after-tax
loss for Whiting Clean Energy was approximately $40.9 million for 2006 and $21.5 million for 2005.
In addition, an amendment to the agreement with BP provides BP with an option, valid for 180 days
from the Amendment’s effective date in December 2006, for BP to purchase the facility free of
liens, for $100 million.



ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Management believes it is unlikely that BP will exercise this option. The carrying amount of the
Whiting Clean Energy facility is approximately $275 million.

ITEM 1B.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

2,574 mw, six gas-fired generating units with a net capacity of 323 mw and two hydroelectric plants
with a net capability of 10 mw, totaling a net capability of 2,907 mw. Northern Indiana’s Mitchell
Station, indefinitely shut down in 2002, is not included in the net capacity of the three
coal-fired generation stations. Northern Indiana’s generating requirements are currently under
review. Northern Indiana’s Integrated Resource Plan, filed with the IURC in November 2005,
indicated a gap between customer demand projections and company owned generating capability,
primarily in peak hours during the summer.

Other Operations.

PEI owns and operates the Whiting Clean Energy project at BP’s Whiting, Indiana
refinery, which is a 525 mw cogeneration facility that uses natural gas to produce electricity for
sale in the wholesale markets and also provides steam for industrial use. Through other
subsidiaries, NiSource owns the Southlake Complex, its 325,000 square foot headquarters building
located in Merrillville, Indiana and other residential and development property.



ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Character of Ownership.

The principal offices and properties of NiSource and its subsidiaries are
held in fee and are free from encumbrances, subject to minor exceptions, none of which are of such
a nature as to impair substantially the usefulness of such properties. Many of the offices in
various communities served are occupied by subsidiaries of NiSource under leases. All properties
are subject to liens for taxes, assessments and undetermined charges (if any) incidental to
construction. It is NiSource’s practice regularly to pay such amounts, as and when due, unless
contested in good faith. In general, the electric lines, gas pipelines and related facilities are
located on land not owned in fee but are covered by necessary consents of various governmental
authorities or by appropriate rights obtained from owners of private property. NiSource does not,
however, generally have specific easements from the owners of the property adjacent to public
highways over, upon or under which its electric lines and gas distribution pipelines are located.
At the time each of the principal properties was purchased a title search was made. In general, no
examination of titles as to rights-of-way for electric lines, gas pipelines or related facilities
was made, other than examination, in certain cases, to verify the grantors’ ownership and the lien
status thereof.



ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

NiSource Inc.

1.

Stand Energy Corporation, et al. v. Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation, et al.,
Kanawha County Court, West Virginia

On July 14, 2004, Stand Energy Corporation filed a complaint in Kanawha County Court in West
Virginia. The complaint contains allegations against various NiSource companies, including
Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, and asserts that those companies and certain “select
shippers” engaged in an “illegal gas scheme” that constituted a breach of contract and violated
state law. The “illegal gas scheme” complained of by the plaintiffs relates to the Columbia
Transmission and Columbia Gulf gas imbalance transactions that were the subject of the FERC
enforcement staff investigation and subsequent settlement approved in October 2000. Columbia
Transmission and Columbia Gulf filed a Motion to Dismiss on September 10, 2004. In October
2004, however, the plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint, which clarified the identity
of some of the “select shipper” defendants and added a federal antitrust cause of action. To
address the issues raised in the Second Amended Complaint, the Columbia companies revised their
briefs in support of the previously filed motions to dismiss. In June 2005, the Court granted
in part and denied in part the Columbia companies’ motion to dismiss the Second Amended
Complaint. The Columbia companies have filed an answer to the Second Amended Complaint. On
December 1, 2005, Plaintiffs filed a motion to certify this case as a class action. The Court
has ordered that discovery will proceed on the issue of class certification as well as the
merits.

2.

Vivian K. Kershaw et al. v. Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., et al., Chautauqua County
Court, New York

Plaintiffs filed a complaint in 2000 against CNR, a former subsidiary, Columbia Transmission,
Columbia and CER. The complaint alleges that plaintiffs own an interest in oil and gas leases
in New York and that the defendants have underpaid royalties on those leases by, among other
things, failing to base royalties on the price at which natural gas is sold to the end-user and
by improperly deducting post-production costs. Plaintiffs seek the alleged royalty underpayment
and punitive damages. The complaint also seeks class action status on behalf of all royalty
owners in oil and gas leases owned by the defendants. Discovery is currently stayed while the
parties seek to determine if the matter can be settled.

3.

United States of America ex rel. Jack J. Grynberg v. Columbia Gas Transmission
Corporation, et al., U.S. District Court, E.D. Louisiana

The plaintiff filed a complaint in 1997, under the False Claims Act, on behalf of the United
States of America, against approximately seventy pipelines, including Columbia Gulf and Columbia
Transmission. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants had submitted false royalty reports to
the government (or caused others to do so) by mis-measuring the volume and heating content of
natural gas produced on Federal land and Indian lands. The Plaintiff’s original complaint was
dismissed without prejudice for misjoinder of parties and for failing to plead fraud with
specificity. The plaintiff then filed over sixty-five new False Claims Act complaints against
over 330 defendants in numerous Federal courts. One of those complaints was filed in the
Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against Columbia and thirteen
affiliated entities (collectively, the “Columbia defendants”).

Plaintiff’s second complaint, filed in 1997, repeats the mis-measurement claims previously made
and adds valuation claims alleging that the defendants have undervalued natural gas for royalty
purposes in various ways, including sales to affiliated entities at artificially low prices.
Most of the Grynberg cases were transferred to Federal court in Wyoming in 1999.

On October 20, 2006, the Federal District Court issued an Order granting the Columbia defendants’
motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Plaintiff has appealed the
dismissal of the Columbia defendants.



ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

4.

Tawney, et al. v. Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., Roane County, WV Circuit Court

The Plaintiffs, who are West Virginia landowners, filed a lawsuit in early 2003 against CNR
alleging that CNR underpaid royalties on gas produced on their land by improperly deducting
post-production costs and not paying a fair value for the gas. In December 2004, the court
granted plaintiffs’ motion to add NiSource and Columbia as defendants. Plaintiffs also claimed
that the defendants fraudulently concealed the deduction of post-production charges. The court
certified the case as a class action that includes any person who, after July 31, 1990, received
or is due royalties from CNR (and its predecessors or successors) on lands lying within the
boundary of the state of West Virginia. All claims by the government of the United States are
excluded from the class. Although NiSource sold CNR in 2003, NiSource remains obligated to
manage this litigation and for the majority of any damages ultimately awarded to the plaintiffs.
On January 27, 2007 the jury hearing the case returned a verdict against all defendants in the
amount of $404.3 million; this is comprised of $134.3 million in compensatory damages and $270
million in punitive damages. The defendants have filed motions with the trial court challenging
the award and a hearing on these motions is anticipated in March of 2007. Unless the trial
court substantially revises the jury’s verdict, the defendants intend to appeal the judgment to
the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, which may or may not accept the appeal. As of the
end of 2006, NiSource increased its reserve for this matter based on the jury’s verdict, but did
not reserve any amount with regard to the punitive damages portion of the verdict.

5.

John Thacker, et al. v. Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C., U.S. District Court, E.D.
Kentucky

On February 8, 2007, Plaintiff filed this purported class action, alleging that Chesapeake
Appalachia, L.L.C. (“Chesapeake”) has failed to pay royalty owners the correct amounts pursuant
to the provisions of their oil and gas leases covering real property located within the state of
Kentucky. By letter dated February 14, 2007, Chesapeake has demanded indemnification for these
claims from NiSource/CEG pursuant to the provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreement dated July
3, 2003, among CEG, NiSource, and Triana, Chesapeake’s predecessor in interest. The Company is
still reviewing the underlying lawsuit and the Stock Purchase Agreement to determine its
response to the indemnification demand.

6.

Environmental Protection Agency Notice of Violation

On September 29, 2004, the EPA issued an NOV to Northern Indiana for alleged violations of the
Clean Air Act and the Indiana SIP. The NOV alleges that modifications were made to certain
boiler units at three of Northern Indiana’s generating stations between the years of 1985 and
1995 without obtaining appropriate air permits for the modifications. Northern Indiana is
currently in discussions with the EPA regarding possible resolutions to this NOV.

7.

Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
Proposed Consent Order and Agreement

On February 21, 2007, Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection provided representatives of Columbia
Transmission with a proposed Consent Order and Agreement covering an
unmanned equipment storage site located in rural southwest
Pennsylvania. The site in question is also subject to the EPA’s
Administrative Order by Consent (Refer to Note 18.F
“Environmental Matters” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding the
Administrative Order by Consent). Pursuant to that order, Columbia
Transmission has characterized the site and proposed remedial
measures for EPA’s approval. Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection’s proposed order alleges that Columbia
Transmission has violated the state’s Clean Streams Act and Solid
Waste Management Act by discharging petroleum products onto the
property and into the waters of the state. In addition to requiring
remediation and monitoring activities at the site, the state has
proposed penalties for these violations. Columbia Transmission plans
to engage in further discussions with the agency regarding the
proposed order, including the rationale for the proposed penalty.

As of December 31, 2006, NiSource had 40,401 common stockholders of record and 273,654,180
shares outstanding.

Holders of shares of NiSource’s common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, as and if
declared by NiSource’s Board out of funds legally available. The policy of the Board has been to
declare cash dividends on a quarterly basis payable on or about the 20th day of February, May,
August and November. NiSource paid quarterly common dividends totaling $0.92 per share for the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. At its January 5, 2007 meeting, the Board declared a
quarterly common dividend of $0.23 per share, payable on February 20, 2007 to holders of record on
January 31, 2007.

Although the Board currently intends to continue the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on
common shares, the timing and amount of future dividends will depend on the earnings of NiSource’s
subsidiaries, their financial condition, cash requirements, regulatory restrictions, any
restrictions in financing agreements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.

Note regarding forward-looking statements

The Management’s Discussion and Analysis, including statements regarding market risk sensitive
instruments, contains “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Investors and prospective investors should understand that many factors govern whether
any forward-looking statement contained herein will be or can be realized. Any one of those
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning NiSource’s plans,
objectives, expected performance, expenditures and recovery of expenditures through rates, stated
on either a consolidated or segment basis, and any and all underlying assumptions and other
statements that are other than statements of historical fact. From time to time, NiSource may
publish or otherwise make available forward-looking statements of this nature. All such subsequent
forward-looking statements, whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of NiSource,
are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. All forward-looking statements are
based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance
that actual results will not differ materially.

Realization of NiSource’s objectives and expected performance is subject to a wide range of risks
and can be adversely affected by, among other things, weather, fluctuations in supply and demand
for energy commodities, growth opportunities for NiSource’s businesses, increased competition in
deregulated energy markets, the success of regulatory and commercial initiatives, dealings with
third parties over whom NiSource has no control, the effectiveness of NiSource’s outsourcing
initiative, actual operating experience of NiSource’s assets, the regulatory process, regulatory
and legislative changes, changes in general economic, capital and commodity market conditions, and
counter-party credit risk, many of which risks are beyond the control of NiSource. In addition,
the relative contributions to profitability by each segment, and the assumptions underlying the
forward-looking statements relating thereto, may change over time.

CONSOLIDATED REVIEW

Executive Summary

NiSource is an energy holding company whose subsidiaries are engaged in the transmission, storage
and distribution of natural gas in the high-demand energy corridor stretching from the Gulf Coast
through the Midwest to New England and the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity
in Indiana. NiSource generates virtually 100% of its operating income through these rate-regulated
businesses. A significant portion of NiSource’s operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations in
sales. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, net revenues
from gas are more significant, and during the cooling season, which is primarily from June through
September, net revenues from electric sales and transportation services are more significant than
in other months.

NiSource is a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, NiSource reported income from continuing operations
before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $313.5 million, or $1.15 per basic
share, compared to $284.1 million, or $1.05 per basic share in 2005.

The increase in income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of changes in accounting
principle was primarily due to the following factors:

•

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues increased due
to increased demand services and sales of shorter-term
transportation and storage services.

•

Strong operating results within Electric Operations due primarily
to a reduction in unrecoverable MISO costs, strong industrial
sales, and customer growth.

•

Decreased interest expense due to the refinancing of $2.4 billion
in long-term debt at lower rates during 2005.

•

2005 results included a loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt of $108.6 million and
restructuring charges and other costs associated with the IBM outsourcing initiative totaling
$82.8 million.

These increases were partially offset by the following items:

These factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the
following discussions of “Results of Operations” and “Results and Discussion of Segment
Operations.”

Financial and Strategic Review

NiSource’s senior management and Board are continuing the strategic and financial review process
initiated during 2006 to unlock the underlying value of the company’s asset base and position it
for the future. NiSource expects to be in a position to communicate the results of this process
early in 2007.

Four-Point Platform for Growth

NiSource has established four key initiatives to build a platform for long-term, sustainable
growth: commercial and regulatory initiatives; commercial growth and expansion of the gas
transmission and storage business; financial management of the balance sheet; and process and
expense management.

Commercial and Regulatory Initiatives

Whiting Clean Energy

.

On December 18, 2006, Whiting Clean Energy and BP executed Amendment IV
which materially amended the terms of the ESA under which Whiting Clean Energy provides steam to
BP. The agreement specifies a planned termination of the ESA at the end of 2009, with options for
BP to extend the term one additional year under renegotiated steam pricing. Whiting Clean Energy
accrued $17.0 million in costs associated with contract termination terms under the agreement. In
addition, Amendment IV provides BP an option, valid for 180 days from the Amendment’s effective
date, for BP to purchase the facility free of liens for $100 million.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Management believes it is unlikely that BP will exercise this option. The carrying amount of the
Whiting Clean Energy facility is approximately $275 million.

Under the new terms of the agreement, Whiting Clean Energy’s financial performance should improve
beginning in 2007. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project will continue to be
dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load
dispatch patterns and the steam requirements for BP’s oil refinery.

Customer Conservation.

NiSource remains focused on the effects of customer conservation and is
taking steps to address this issue. NiSource is developing and pursuing a number of regulatory
initiatives throughout its distribution markets to mitigate the impact of conservation and customer
attrition either through broader rate proceedings or specific mechanisms such as rate design,
decoupling or other initiatives developed to moderate the impact of conservation.

Rate Developments.

NiSource’s subsidiary, Columbia of Virginia, reached a comprehensive settlement
agreement with its commercial and regulatory stakeholders on an innovative PBR plan. The
agreement, which has been approved by the VSCC and became effective January 1, 2007, establishes a
PBR for a four-year period, freezing Columbia of Virginia’s non-gas rates at their current levels
and setting up an earnings sharing mechanism and temporary rate credits during the PBR plan period,
and contains a commitment by Columbia of Virginia to expand its system to continue to meet growth
needs.

On February 1, 2007, Columbia of Kentucky filed a base rate case requesting an increase in rates of
$12.6 million, or approximately 8%. Included in the filing is a request for approval of an
accelerated main replacement cost recovery mechanism, in order to facilitate replacement of certain
parts of Columbia of Kentucky’s natural gas distribution system. Also, included are proposals to
help offset the effects of recent usage declines and increased customer attrition. Hearings are
expected to be held in the second quarter of 2007, with new rates expected to be in effect by the
third quarter of 2007.

In mid 2006, Northern Indiana filed a petition which simplifies gas distribution rates, stabilizes
revenues and provides for energy efficiency funding. Northern Indiana filed its detailed case in
this proceeding in January 2007, based upon lengthy and detailed discussion with stakeholders. All
parties requested, and the IURC has granted, an expedited schedule in this proceeding. Northern
Indiana expects a final order in the cause in the second quarter of 2007. Northern Indiana’s
proposal, called Rate Simplification, would provide funding for weatherization and other customer
programs while also providing relief to the company for reduced customer usage.

Refer to the “Results and Discussion of Segment Operations” for a complete discussion of regulatory
matters.

Commercial Growth and Expansion of the Gas Transmission and Storage Business

Sales of Shorter-Term Transportation and Storage Services.

Seasonal price fluctuations in the
national energy market created opportunities for customers to utilize existing shorter-term
transportation and storage tariff services provided by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. A
commercial team is in place focused on this effort to capitalize on market opportunities. Columbia
Transmission entered into contracts that represent revenues in excess of $45 million of
shorter-term business for 2006. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf plan to continue offering
these shorter-term transportation and storage services. Customer requirements for these services
will vary according to market conditions which include such factors as commodity price volatility,
geographic price differentials and the physical capacity and capabilities of the pipeline network.

Hardy Storage

. Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly
develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for
natural gas in the eastern United States. Construction began in the first quarter of 2006 and
Hardy Storage is expected to be placed in service in the second quarter of 2007.

Millennium Pipeline.

Millennium has received FERC approval for a pipeline project, in which
Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as operator, which will provide access to a
number of supply and

storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The reconfigured project, which was approved
by the FERC in a certificate order issued December 21, 2006, will begin at an interconnect with
Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards
Syracuse, New York. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium
near Corning, New York. Millennium will extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas
Transmission Co. at Ramapo, New York.

Eastern Market Expansion.

Eastern Market Expansion, a combined storage and transportation project
designed to meet core market growth in the mid-Atlantic region that already has binding customer
agreements, continues with NEPA pre-filing activities. Columbia Transmission anticipates filing a
certificate application with the FERC in April 2007.

Financial Management of the Balance Sheet

Interest Expense Savings.

NiSource refinanced $2.4 billion of long-term debt at lower rates during
2005. As a result, interest expense, net was $387.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
a decrease of $32.7 million compared to last year. This improvement was partially offset by lower
interest income and higher costs related to the sale of accounts receivable which both contributed
to the $20.5 million change in Other, net.

Credit Ratings

. During 2006, Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings all
reaffirmed NiSource’s investment grade credit ratings with a stable outlook.

Process and Expense Management

IBM Agreement.

During the second quarter of 2005, NiSource Corporate Services reached a
definitive agreement with IBM under which IBM will provide a broad range of business transformation
and outsourcing services to NiSource. NiSource’s original expectation of the 10-year agreement
with IBM was to deliver upwards of $530 million in gross savings in operating and capital costs.
This cost savings is dependent upon many factors, and unanticipated changes in operations may cause
actual cost savings to be substantially less than expected. Many functions have recently been
transitioned to IBM and many new personnel have assumed responsibilities across these functions,
increasing the risk of operational delays, potential errors and control failures which may have an
impact on NiSource and its financial condition.

As a part of this transformation, many new information technology systems and process changes have
an accelerated time-line for completion, increasing the risk of operational delays, potential
errors and control failures which may have an impact on NiSource and its financial condition. In
August, 2006, NiSource and IBM decided to delay further implementation of certain information
technology systems due to difficulties encountered with the first wave of new system
implementations. This delay may decrease the level of projected operating cost savings while
continuing to ensure stable operations. NiSource is currently engaged in an overall assessment of
the outsourcing initiative primarily to focus on operational and transformational improvements and
develop an integrated plan that enables NiSource to achieve its business objectives going forward.

Insurance Costs.

NiSource renewed both its onshore and offshore property and casualty insurance
programs in 2006. NiSource sustained an increase in property insurance costs directly attributable
to the increase in insurance premiums for offshore and onshore facilities located in or near the
Gulf of Mexico. Casualty premiums remained relatively flat compared to the previous year. Such
increases and restrictions in coverage for Gulf of Mexico windstorm exposures were driven by losses
experienced by the insurance industry over the past few years, resulting from hurricanes such as
Ivan, Katrina and Rita.

Ethics and Controls

NiSource has always been committed to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well
as requiring a strong commitment to ethical behavior by its employees. During 2006, NiSource
tested all significant controls across its financial processes and NiSource’s management has
concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end
of the period covered by this Form 10-K. Refer to “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting” included in Item 9A. NiSource’s senior management takes an active role in the
development of this Form 10-K and the monitoring of the company’s internal control structure and

performance. In addition, NiSource will continue the mandatory ethics-training program in which
employees at every level and in every function of the organization participate.

Results of Operations

The Consolidated Review information should be read taking into account the critical accounting
policies applied by NiSource and discussed in “Other Information” of this Item 7.

Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, NiSource reported income from continuing operations
before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $313.5 million, or $1.15 per basic
share, compared to $284.1 million, or $1.05 per basic share in 2005. Income from continuing
operations before the cumulative change in accounting principle for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2004 was $433.0 million, or $1.64 per basic share.

Including results from discontinued operations and the change in accounting principle, NiSource
reported 2006 net income of $282.2 million, or $1.04 per basic share, 2005 net income of $306.5
million, or $1.13 per basic share, and 2004 net income of $436.3 million, or $1.65 per basic share.

Comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory trackers that allow for the
recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. Therefore, increases in these
tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no
impact on income from continuing operations. An increase in operating expenses of $55.3
million for the 2006 year was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting
recovery of these tracked costs. In the 2005 period, an increase in operating expenses of
$33.6 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting
recovery of these costs.

Net Revenues

Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2006 were $3,124.6 million, a $22.0 million decrease compared with 2005. Excluding
the impact of $55.3 million of trackers discussed above, net revenues decreased by $77.3 million.
The change was principally driven by unfavorable weather compared to the prior year, which impacted
Gas Distribution Operations net revenues by approximately $89 million as NiSource’s gas markets
experienced 14% warmer weather compared to last year, and decreased Electric Operations net
revenues by approximately $21 million due to the northern Indiana electric market experiencing a
24% cooler summer compared to the 2005 summer cooling season. Gas Distribution Operations net
revenues were also significantly affected by decreased residential gas customer usage amounting to
approximately $22 million. In addition, last year’s results benefited from a third party buyout of
a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shipper’s long term contract, which amounted to
$8.9 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by increased sales of
shorter-term transportation and storage services in Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
amounting to $43.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues increased by $27.3 million as a
result of a reduction in unrecoverable MISO costs included in costs of sales, which included the
impact of a favorable regulatory ruling on the recoverability of certain MISO charges, timing of
customer credits, proceeds from emission allowances, strong industrial sales and customer growth.

Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 were $3,146.6
million, a $99.1 million increase compared with 2004. Excluding the impact of $33.6 million of
trackers discussed above, net revenues increased by $65.5 million. Favorable weather during 2005
as compared to 2004 increased net revenues approximately $24 million and $27 million for Gas
Distribution Operations and Electric Operations, respectively. Net revenues also improved due to
increased residential and commercial customers and increased overall customer usage within Electric
Operations contributing approximately $24.4 million, improved results from Whiting Clean Energy of
$17.6 million, increased residential customers for Gas Distribution Operations contributing
approximately $8 million, and $12.1 million recognized on the buyout of a large customer gas
contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a decline in customer usage within
Gas Distribution Operations of approximately $33.1 million, lower Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations revenues of $20.3 million attributable to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service
contracts with major pipeline customers, net of remarketing activities, and increases in the cost
of service for Electric Operations associated with MISO amounting to $15.7 million.

Expenses

Operating expenses were $2,232.3 million in 2006, a $38.1 million increase from 2005. Excluding
increases in expenses that are recovered through regulatory trackers and corresponding increases in
net revenues (see discussion above) operating expenses decreased $17.2 million. The decrease was
primarily due to impacts in 2005 which included restructuring charges, transition costs, pension
and other postretirement benefit charges, and other costs associated with the IBM outsourcing
initiative totaling $82.8 million, a $10.9 million charge for obsolete software systems and a $10.9
million impairment charge related to goodwill at Kokomo Gas. Operating expense increases in 2006
included $18.1 million for certain legal matters, a $17 million accrual in conjunction with the BP
contract revision, higher employee and administrative expenses of approximately $17 million,
transition and other restructuring charges associated with the IBM agreement of $12.3 million,
generation and maintenance costs of $9.3 million in Electric Operations, and higher property
insurance premiums of $8.7 million mainly for offshore and onshore facilities located in or near
the Gulf of Mexico.

Operating expenses of $2,194.2 million for 2005 increased $224.7 million over 2004. Excluding
increases in expenses that are recovered through regulatory trackers and corresponding increases in
net revenues (see discussion above), operating expenses increased $189.0 million. Operation and
maintenance expense increased largely due to restructuring charges, including a pension and other
postretirement benefit charge, transition costs and consulting fees related to the outsourcing
initiative and service agreement with IBM which totaled $82.8 million and higher electric
generation expenses of $7.2 million. Depreciation expense increased approximately $30 million as a
result of the expiration in November 2004 of the prior Columbia of Ohio regulatory stipulation that
allowed for deferral of certain depreciation amounts. The 2004 period benefited from a reduction
in estimated property tax accruals amounting to $33.0 million, while gross receipts tax increased
$16.0 million in 2005, which is offset in revenue. In addition, goodwill associated with Kokomo
Gas was impaired by $10.9 million and certain software systems were impaired totaling $10.9 million
due to the outsourcing initiative and service agreement with IBM.

Equity Earnings (Loss) in Unconsolidated Affiliates

Equity Earnings (Loss) in Unconsolidated Affiliates reduced 2006 income $12.3 million compared to
earnings of $0.2 million in 2005. Equity Earnings (Loss) in Unconsolidated Affiliates include
investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations business. In December 2006, Millennium received FERC approval for a pipeline project.
The certificate order approved certain project costs related to the construction and development of the
Millennium project. The order also approved the vacating of portions of the
original September 2002 Millennium certificate that related to other facilities. The Millennium
owners no longer believe the recovery of the capitalized costs related to the vacated portions of
the project is probable. Therefore, Millennium has fully reserved the capitalized costs related to
the development of the vacated portions. NiSource recorded a $13 million charge reflecting its
share of Millennium’s reserve during the fourth quarter of 2006.

Other Income (Deductions)

Other Income (Deductions) in 2006 reduced income $395.7 million compared to a reduction of $518.9
million in 2005. A loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt of $108.6 million during 2005
and decreased interest expense of $32.7 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to the refinancing of
$2.4 billion in long-term debt at lower rates during 2005, drove the decrease in other deductions.
Other, net was a loss of $6.5 million for 2006 compared to income of $14.0 million for the
comparable 2005 period due to lower interest income and increased costs associated with the sale of
accounts receivable. Higher fees, due to higher interest rates, and increased levels of accounts
receivable balances resulted in the higher expenses associated with the sale of accounts
receivable.

Other Income (Deductions) in 2005 reduced income $518.9 million compared to a reduction of $402.3
million in 2004. A loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt of $108.6 million recognized in
2005 drove the increased expense. Interest expense, net increased $19 million from 2004 primarily
due to the impact of higher short-term interest rates on variable rate debt and higher average
long-term debt balances due to the prefunding of November 2005 debt maturities.

Income Taxes

Income taxes increased $21.2 million in 2006 as compared with 2005 primarily due to higher pre-tax
income from the prior year. Income taxes decreased $93.1 million in 2005 from 2004 primarily due
to lower pre-tax income from



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

the prior year. The effective income tax rates were 35.3%, 34.5%, and 35.9% in 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. The overall effective tax rate increase in 2006 versus 2005 was due to
favorable state and federal income tax adjustments recorded in 2005 (discussed below) and a
reduction in the electric production deduction and low income housing credits from those recorded
in 2005. The increase was partially offset by a lower effective state income tax rate in 2006 due
to a reduction in deferred state income tax liabilities. It is expected that state income tax
expense will return to more historic levels in 2007.

The 1.4% decrease in the effective tax rate from 2004 to 2005 is due to the impact of the tax
benefit associated with the electric production deduction (discussed below), an adjustment to
deferred taxes at Northern Indiana related to a reduction in deferred income tax requirements and a
reduction in deferred state income tax liabilities resulting from a revised estimate of
consolidated state income tax apportionment factors. Offsetting these reductions is an increase in
the effective tax rate associated with the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge recorded at
Kokomo Gas and increased taxes related to Ohio income tax law changes enacted on June 30, 2005.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, signed into law on October 22, 2004, created new Internal
Revenue Code Section 199 which, beginning in 2005, permits taxpayers to claim a deduction from
taxable income attributable to certain domestic production activities. Northern Indiana and
Whiting Clean Energy’s electric production activities qualify for this deduction. The deduction is
equal to 3% of QPAI for the taxable year, with certain limitations. This deduction increases to 6%
of QPAI beginning in 2007 and 9% of QPAI beginning in 2010 and thereafter. The tax benefit for the
Section 199 domestic production activities deduction claimed in NiSource’s 2005 consolidated
federal income tax return was $0.9 million and is estimated to be $0.9 million for 2006.

Discontinued Operations

Discontinued operations reflected an after-tax loss of $31.7 million, or $0.11 loss per basic
share, in 2006, income of $22.7 million, or $0.08 per basic share, in 2005 and income of $3.3
million, or $0.01 per basic share, in 2004. The loss from discontinued operations in 2006 was
primarily the result of an increase to legal reserves and the sale of certain low-income
housing investments. Results from discontinued operations in 2005, net of taxes, include a
gain on disposition of discontinued operations of $43.5 million partially offset by a loss
from discontinued operations of $20.8 million. The gain on disposition of discontinued
operations, net of taxes, resulted from changes to reserves for contingencies related
primarily to the previous sales of IWC, former Primary Energy subsidiaries and other
dispositions. The loss from discontinued operations in 2005 included changes to reserves for
contingencies primarily related to CER and an impairment of assets related to Transcom. In
2004, income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is primarily from a reduction in
estimated income taxes associated with NiSource’s former exploration and production
subsidiary, CER.

Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2006 of $0.4 million, net of taxes,
resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 123R. Refer to Note 14, “Stock-Based
Compensation,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 123R. The cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle in 2005 of a $0.3 million loss, net of taxes, resulted from the
cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. Refer to Note 6, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the cumulative
effect of adopting FIN 47.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Historically, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating
requirements. A significant portion of NiSource’s operations, most notably in the gas
distribution, gas transportation and electric distribution businesses, is subject to seasonal
fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through
March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements.
During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the
electric business during the summer cooling season and external short-term and long-term financing,
is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary
maintenance of facilities.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Beginning in 2007, capital expenditures and other investing activities are expected to increase due
to age and condition replacement programs and an increase in growth projects (see discussion
below). Capital expenditures are expected to be funded via a combination of cash flow from
operations and new long-term debt issuances.

Operating Activities

Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 was $1,156.2
million, an increase of $443.9 million from a year ago. This increase was primarily due to a
significant reduction in outstanding accounts receivable and the collection of under-recovered gas
cost partially offset by the impact in 2006 of reduced accounts payable balances. High gas cost in
December 2005 resulted in unusually large balances in accounts receivable, accounts payable and
under-recovered gas cost.

Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding.

In 2007, NiSource expects to make contributions of
approximately $50.4 million to its pension plans and approximately $52.3 million to its
postretirement medical and life plans.

Investing Activities

Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities.

The table below reflects actual capital
expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2006, 2005 and 2004 and an estimate for
year 2007. The other investing activities include investing in equity investments such as
Millennium and Hardy Storage.

For 2006, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $648.4 million, an
increase of $49.4 million over 2005. This increase was primarily due to incremental pipeline
expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment including pipeline integrity
costs to comply with the DOT’s Integrity Management Rule as well as increased expenditures to
update electric generation assets.

The Gas Distribution Operations segment’s capital program in 2006 included new business initiatives
to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to
the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to
ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The
Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading
facilities including investments to comply with DOT’s Integrity Management Rule. The Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations segment also invested in new business initiatives to maintain
and expand market share in storage and interstate transportation by meeting the demands of
consumers who will use gas for electric power generation and meeting the needs of existing, new or
growing customers through the construction of significant new facilities, either wholly-owned by
NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. The Electric Operations
segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation,
transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding
NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Capital
expenditures in the Other Operations segment mainly comprise partnership investments and
enterprise-wide information technology infrastructure improvement.

For 2007 the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be
$801.1 million, which is approximately $152.7 million higher than the 2006 level. This higher
spending is mainly due to expenditures to overhaul certain electric generation units within the
Electric Operations segment, modernizing and upgrading facilities at certain distribution companies
and an increase in expenditures for key market area growth projects primarily within Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations. The program is expected to be funded via a combination of
cash flow from operations and new long-term debt issuances during 2007.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Financing Activities

On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to periodically sell
up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The
registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSource’s
pre-existing shelf capacity, provided an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. As of
December 31, 2006, NiSource’s remaining shelf capacity was $850 million.

Long-term Debt.

During 2006, NiSource funded the redemption of $434.4 million of long-term debt
with cash from operations and an increase of short term borrowings. NiSource decided not to issue
new long-term debt until the strategic and financial review is completed. The review is expected
to be completed in early 2007.

During November 2006, NiSource redeemed $144.4 million of its senior debentures with an interest
rate of 3.628%. Also during November 2006, NiSource Finance redeemed $250.0 million of its
unsecured notes with an interest rate of 3.20%.

During May 2006, NiSource redeemed $25.0 million of Capital Markets medium-term notes, with an
average interest rate of 7.50%.

During April 2006, NiSource redeemed $15.0 million of Capital Markets medium-term notes, with an
average interest rate of 7.75%.

On November 29, 2005, Columbia redeemed $1.1 billion of its senior unsecured notes that became
callable on November 28, 2005, having an average interest rate of 7.34%. On November 28, 2005,
Columbia redeemed $281.5 million of its senior unsecured notes with an average interest rate of
6.80%. The associated charges included an $86 million non-cash charge relating to the write-off of
the unamortized portion of a fair market value adjustment made at the time of the NiSource Columbia
merger, an $8 million non-cash charge associated with the unamortized portion of swap termination
charges, and a $14 million cash charge for call premiums, all of which were charged to loss on
early extinguishment of long-term debt.

On November 28, 2005, NiSource Finance issued, in the private placement market, $900 million in
unregistered senior unsecured notes in four tranches: $315 million of 7-year notes at a coupon rate
of 5.21%; $230 million of 10-year notes at a coupon rate of 5.36%; $90 million of 11-year notes at
a coupon rate of 5.41%; and $265 million of 20-year notes at a coupon rate of 5.89%. The proceeds,
along with other funding sources, were used to refinance the above mentioned Columbia senior
unsecured notes.

On November 15, 2005, NiSource Finance redeemed $900 million of its senior unsecured notes having
an average interest rate of 7.625%.

On September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of 5.25% 12-year unsecured notes that
mature September 15, 2017 and $550 million of 5.45% 15-year unsecured notes that mature September
15, 2020. The proceeds were used in part to redeem $900 million of NiSource Finance notes due
November 15, 2005. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes, NiSource
Finance terminated $900 million of forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to
NiSource’s swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of
the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively.

During July 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $34.0 million of its medium-term notes with an average
interest rate of 6.62%.

During June 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $39.3 million of its medium-term notes and Bay State
redeemed $10.0 million of its medium-term notes with an average interest rate of 6.79% and 6.58%,
respectively.

During April 2005, NiSource redeemed $30.0 million of Capital Markets medium-term notes, with an
average interest rate of 7.67%.

Cumulative Preferred Stock.

On April 14, 2006, Northern Indiana redeemed all of its outstanding
cumulative preferred stock, having a total redemption value of $81.6 million.

NiSource Inc.

Credit Facilities.

During July 2006, NiSource Finance amended its $1.25 billion five-year
revolving credit facility increasing the aggregate commitment level to $1.5 billion, extending the
termination date by one year to July 2011, and reduced the cost of borrowing. The amended facility
will help maintain a reasonable cushion of short-term liquidity in anticipation of continuing
volatile natural gas prices. During November 2006, NiSource Finance entered into a new $300
million three-month revolving credit agreement with Dresdner Kleinwort that expired February 15,
2007.

NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $1,193.0 million at December 31,
2006, at a weighted average interest rate of 5.68%, and borrowings of $898.0 million at December
31, 2005, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.95%. The increase in short term borrowings was
primarily due to the redemption of long-term debt during 2006. NiSource decided not to issue new
long-term debt until the strategic and financial review is completed. The review is expected to be
completed in early 2007.

As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, NiSource Finance had $81.9 million and $101.6
million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2006, $53.9
million of the $81.9 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate
bi-lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource Finance obtained during
February 2004. Of the remaining $28.0 million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding at
December 31, 2006, $24.6 million resided under NiSource Finance’s five-year credit facility and
$3.4 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution.

As of December 31, 2006, $582.4 million of credit was available under both credit facilities.

Debt Covenants.

NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under both its five-year revolving
credit facility and its three-month revolving credit agreement. NiSource must maintain a debt to
capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of December 31, 2006, NiSource was in compliance
with this financial covenant in both of its credit agreements.

NiSource is also subject to certain other covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such
covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSource’s assets,
generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting
security interests and an additional asset basket equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and/or transfer of
NiSource’s assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit
facilities also include a cross-default provision, which triggers an event of default under the
credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource
or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more.

NiSource’s bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However,
NiSource’s bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured
payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on
NiSource’s assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests,
preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of
NiSource’s consolidated net tangible assets.

Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables.

On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to
sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CORC, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated
May 14, 2004, under the terms of which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the
accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The agreement, which had a scheduled expiration
date of May 12, 2006, was extended for another year to May 11, 2007. The agreement was further
amended on July 1, 2006 increasing the program limit from $300 million to $350 million and
extending the expiration date to June 29, 2007. As of December 31, 2006, $184.3 million of
accounts receivable had been sold by CORC.

Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping
and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives
a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services.

On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of
its trade receivables, as they originate, to NRC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana.
NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement under the term of which it sells an undivided percentage
ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can
purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. NRC’s agreement with the
commercial paper conduit has a scheduled expiration date of December 21, 2007, and can be renewed
if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2006, NRC had sold $189.7 million of
accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if
Northern Indiana’s debt rating falls below BBB- or Baa3 at Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s,
respectively.

Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and
cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which
provides adequate compensation, for such services.

Credit Ratings.

NiSource’s credit ratings continue to be affirmed by the major rating agencies.
Moody’s Investors Services, Standard and Poor’s and Fitch Ratings all affirmed their ratings in
December 2006. Moody’s Investors Services affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at
Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moody’s ratings outlook for NiSource
and its subsidiaries is stable. Standard and Poor’s affirmed its senior unsecured ratings for
NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings for all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poor’s outlook
for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior
unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB+ ratings for Columbia and Northern Indiana. Fitch’s
outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable.

Certain TPC gas derivative agreements contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral
if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB- by Standard
and Poor’s or Baa3 by Moody’s. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings
trigger levels would amount to approximately $20 million to $25 million. In addition to agreements
with ratings triggers, there are other gas derivative agreements that contain “adequate assurance”
or “material adverse change” provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would
amount to approximately $170 million to $175 million.

Columbia Energy Services is the principal for two surety bonds issued to guarantee performance in
two separate long-term gas supply agreements. The surety, in accordance with the terms of its
indemnity agreements, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of
approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2006, the
total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $53.9 million. The
agreement will expire on December 31, 2008.

Columbia was the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales
agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia and had
indemnity values, which declined over time and had ratings triggers based on Columbia’s credit
rating. In the third quarter of 2005, these bonds expired. In February 2006, the forward sales
agreements guaranteed by Columbia were completed.

NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for the
fixed-rate debt, interest is calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for
variable-rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2006. For 2007,
NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $392 million,
which includes $335.4 million of interest payments related to its long-term debt. At December 31,
2006, NiSource also had $1,193.0 million in short-term borrowings outstanding.

NiSource’s subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase
physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices.

NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and
storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2007 to 2019, require
NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges.

In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad
range of business process and support services to NiSource. As part of this agreement, IBM will
operate a broad range of business support functions for NiSource, including processes within the
Human Resources, Finance and Accounting, Supply Chain (procurement), Customer Contact, Meter to
Cash (billing and collections) and Information Technology areas. The agreement also includes a
broad array of transformational consulting services and emerging technology expertise. The
contract has a 10-year term and NiSource has the right to renew it for up to three additional
years. NiSource will pay for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The
variable charge component can fluctuate to reflect NiSource’s actual usage of service and service
levels. Fees may be adjusted to reflect economic changes such as inflation or business changes
that both parties agree to.

Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by
IBM), NiSource must pay IBM a termination charge that will include a breakage fee, repayment of
IBM’s un-recovered capital investments, and IBM wind-down expense. This termination fee can be a
material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the
termination.

NiSource’s other service obligations include agreements with certain rail companies, Pure Air and
General Electric.

Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation
services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various
periods through 2009.

Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products
and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under
this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Northern Indiana pays for the services under a
combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various
performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana
terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty-year contract period.

Whiting Clean Energy has a service agreement with General Electric for certain operation and
maintenance activities for its cogeneration facility located at BP’s Whiting, Indiana refinery for
which certain minimum fees are required. The agreement extends through 2023. The agreement
provides for a $10 million termination penalty to be paid by Whiting Clean Energy to General
Electric to buy out or otherwise terminate the agreement.

Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSource’s pension fund assets as of September 30,
2006, have increased for the fourth year in a row. Additionally, $16.0 million in employer
contributions were made during the 2006 plan year to certain of NiSource’s qualified and
non-qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as
demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute approximately $50.4 million in 2007 to
certain pension plans. NiSource expects to recognize net pension income in 2007 of approximately
$4 million, mainly due to favorable asset returns. In addition, NiSource expects to make
contributions of $52.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2007. See Note 11,
“Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
more information.

NiSource also has obligations associated with various taxes and expects to make tax payments of
approximately $546 million in 2007.

Off Balance Sheet Items

As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements
providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries.
Such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit.

NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $634.4 million of commodity-related
payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy commodity contracts and to satisfy
requirements under forward gas sales agreements of current and former subsidiaries. These
guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial
transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the
commodity-related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $82.5 million, which guarantee
performance of the seller’s covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and
warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees
are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource
would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the
aforementioned guarantees is remote.

NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 18-C, “Guarantees and Indemnities,” in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSource’s off
balance sheet arrangements.

Market Risk Disclosures

Risk is an inherent part of NiSource’s energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly
and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk
involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify,
assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following
principal risks that are involved in NiSource’s energy businesses: commodity market risk,
interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi-faceted process
with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment
and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSource’s senior management takes an
active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that
require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification,
assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and
complex nature of the energy business, NiSource’s risk management policies and procedures
continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSource’s market and credit
risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from
changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level.

Commodity Price Risk

NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries’ operations involving
natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSource’s subsidiaries use derivatives,
including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative
energy trading activity.

Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSource’s rate-regulated subsidiaries
is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas
costs through the rate-making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments.
If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing
services without the benefit of the traditional rate-making process and may be more exposed to
commodity price risk. Some of NiSource’s rate-regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price
risk products to its customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage
under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products
and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.

TPC, on behalf of Whiting Clean Energy, enters into power and gas derivative contracts to manage
commodity price risk associated with operating Whiting Clean Energy. These derivative contracts do
not always receive hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133 and variances in earnings could be
recognized as a result of marking these derivatives to market.

During 2006 and 2005, a gain of $0.1 million and $0.4 million, net of taxes respectively, were
recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as
hedges. No amounts were recognized in earnings in 2006 and $0.4 million was recognized in earnings
in 2005 due to losses on derivatives classified as trading. It is anticipated that during the next
twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income
statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income of
approximately $54.6 million, net of taxes. Refer to Note 8, “Risk Management and Energy Trading
Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSource’s
various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk.

Interest Rate Risk

NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings
under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes,
which have interest rates that are indexed to short-term market interest rates. NiSource is also
exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed-to-variable interest rate
swaps that hedge the fair value of long-term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt
obligations subject to fluctuations in short-term market interest rates, an increase in short-term
interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $25.3 million and
$20.1 million for the years 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource
Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six
counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being
amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an
effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively.

NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics
of its outstanding long-term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance
entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million
with six counterparties having a 6 1/2-year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based
upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6-month BBA
LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of
the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009.

On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in
a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11-year term. NiSource Finance
will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount
based on U.S. 6-month BBA LIBOR plus



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps.
In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013.

As a result of these fixed-to-variable interest rate swap transactions, $1,160 million of NiSource
Finance’s existing long-term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates.

Credit Risk

Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSource’s business
activities. NiSource’s extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. Written
guidelines approved by NiSource’s Risk Management Committee document the management approval levels
for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation procedures.
Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent
of all commercial operations. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer,
supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on
or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk
arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable
resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of
both current obligations and the market value of forward positions. Current credit exposure is
generally measured by the notional or principal value of obligations and direct credit substitutes,
such as commitments, stand-by letters of credit and guarantees. In determining exposure, NiSource
considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk.

Market Risk Measurement

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates,
indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in
losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one-day VaR at a 95%
confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a
variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market
exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was zero during 2006. The daily
market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was
$0.2 million, $0.9 million and zero during 2006, respectively. Prospectively, management has set
the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management
actions to reduce portfolio risk. The VaR limit for power trading was reduced to zero in the third
quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts outstanding at that time. Power
and gas derivative contracts entered into to manage price risk associated with Whiting Clean Energy
are limited to quantities surrounding the physical generation capacity of Whiting Clean Energy and
the gas requirements to operate the facility.

Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies” included in this Item 7 and Note 1-U, “Accounting for Risk
Management and Energy Trading Activities,” and Note 8, “Risk Management and Energy Trading
Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSource’s
risk management.

Other Information

Critical Accounting Policies

NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below
that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSource’s results of operations
and Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.

SFAS No. 71 provides that rate-regulated
subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of
the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the
costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that
such rates can be charged and collected. NiSource’s rate-regulated subsidiaries follow the
accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to
utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in
service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets
and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Sheets were $1,563.3 million and $1,551.0 million at December 31, 2006, and $1,203.1 million and
$1,386.1 million at December 31, 2005, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note
1-F, “Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its
costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the
criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write-down of all or a portion of
NiSource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is
approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally
accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during
such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable
amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required
to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In management’s opinion, NiSource’s regulated
subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future.

Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets require
specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of
these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for
deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory
action amounted to $68.3 million at December 31, 2006. If NiSource determined that the amounts
included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be
required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts.

Accounting for Risk Management Activities.

Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the
fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation.
Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other
comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of
such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective
portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in
earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and
losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged
item. As a result of the rate-making process, the rate-regulated subsidiaries generally record
gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings
when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized
in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates.

In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the
hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness
test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout
the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded
currently in earnings.

Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate
certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is
such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the
underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange-traded natural gas futures and options
contracts and over-the-counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its
natural-gas-related businesses. NiSource had $287.6 million and $376.0 million of price risk
management assets, of which $286.4 million and $338.1 million related to hedges, at December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively, and $297.6 million and $94.5 million of price risk management
liabilities, of which $235.3 million and $85.6 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of
taxes, was $31.4 million and $150.7 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Pensions and Postretirement Benefits.

NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and
other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, SFAS No. 88 and SFAS
No. 106, as amended by SFAS No. 158. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense
related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be
used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long-term returns on plan assets and employee
longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long-term nature of the
associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have
material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For

discussion of NiSource’s pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 11, “Pension and Other
Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Goodwill Impairment Testing

.

As of December 31, 2006, NiSource had $3.7 billion of goodwill on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, which was mainly due to the acquisition of Columbia. NiSource performs
its annual impairment test of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142 in June. For the purpose of
testing for impairment the goodwill recorded in the acquisition of Columbia, the related
subsidiaries were aggregated into two distinct reporting units, one within the Gas Distribution
Operations segment and one within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. NiSource
uses the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for the
purpose of this test. Refer to Notes 1-J and 5, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Long-lived Asset Impairment Testing.

NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets contains long-lived
assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under SFAS No.
71. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired as
per SFAS No. 144. When an asset’s carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash
flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset’s
fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1-K, “Long-lived Assets,” in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Contingencies.

A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental,
tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated.
Accounting for contingencies require significant management judgment regarding the estimated
probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and
associated probability are made based on the current facts available, present laws and regulations
and third party consultation. Management’s assessment of the contingent liability could change as
a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ
from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSource’s results of operations and financial
position. Refer to Note 18, “Other Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

Asset Retirement Obligations.

NiSource accounts for retirement obligations under the provisions of
SFAS No. 143, as amended by FIN 47, which require entities to record the fair value of a liability
for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted
market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value
techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash
flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit-adjusted risk free rates.
When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the
carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the
capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate-regulated
subsidiaries defer the difference between the amount recognized for depreciation and accretion and
the amount collected in rates as required pursuant to SFAS No. 71 for those amounts it has
collected in rates or expects to collect in future rates. Refer to Note 6, “Asset Retirement
Obligations,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS No. 158 — Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158 to improve existing reporting for defined benefit
postretirement plans by requiring employers to recognize in the statement of financial position the
overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan, among other changes. In
the fourth quarter of 2006, NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158 requiring employers to
recognize in the statement of financial position the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined
benefit postretirement plan, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets
and the benefit obligation. Based on the measurement of the various defined benefit pension and
other postretirement plans’ assets and benefit obligations at September 30, 2006, the pretax impact
of adopting SFAS No. 158 decreased intangible assets by $46.5 million, decreased deferred charges
and other assets by $1.1 million, increased regulatory assets by $538.8 million, increased
accumulated other comprehensive income by $239.8 million and increased accrued liabilities for
postretirement and postemployment benefits by $251.4 million. With the adoption of SFAS No. 158
NiSource determined that for certain rate-regulated subsidiaries the future recovery of pension and
other postretirement plans costs is probable in accordance with the requirements of SFAS



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

No. 71. These rate-regulated subsidiaries recorded regulatory assets and liabilities that would
otherwise have been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income. In addition, NiSource
recorded a reduction in deferred income taxes of approximately $96 million. NiSource will early
adopt the SFAS No. 158 measurement date provisions in the first quarter of 2007 requiring employers
to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the fiscal year-end. Upon adopting the
measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158 in the first quarter of 2007, NiSource will decrease
its accrued liabilities for postretirement and postemployment benefits by approximately $89 million
and increase its deferred charges and other assets by approximately $9 million. In addition, 2007
expense for pension and postretirement benefits will reflect the updated measurement date
valuations.

SAB No. 108 — Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements
in Current Year Financial Statements.

In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108 to provide
guidance on how prior year misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in
current year financial statements. SAB No. 108 became effective for periods ending after November
15, 2006. There were no impacts to NiSource’s consolidated financial statements as a result of the
adoption of SAB No. 108.

SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) — Share-Based Payment.

Effective January 1, 2006, NiSource
adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method. SFAS No. 123R requires
measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and
recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. In accordance
with the modified prospective transition method, NiSource’s consolidated financial statements for
prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS No. 123R.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, NiSource applied the intrinsic value method of APB No. 25
for awards granted under its stock-based compensation plans and complied with the disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 123. There were no modifications to awards as a result of the adoption of
SFAS 123R.

When it adopted SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2006, NiSource recognized a cumulative effect
of change in accounting principle of $0.4 million, net of income taxes, which reflected the net
cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather
than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. Other than the requirement for
expensing stock options, outstanding share-based awards will continue to be accounted for
substantially as they are currently. As of December 31, 2006, the total remaining unrecognized
compensation cost related to non-vested awards amounted to $5.1 million, which will be amortized
over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of 2.6 years.

SFAS No. 154 — Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No.
154 to provide guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error
corrections, which is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2005. SFAS No. 154 establishes, unless impracticable,
retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in
the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle,
and for the reporting of an error correction. Effective January 1, 2006, NiSource adopted SFAS No.
154. There were no impacts to NiSource’s consolidated financial statements as a result of the
adoption of SFAS No. 154.

FIN 47 — Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations.

In March 2005, the FASB issued
FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and to provide
additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the
fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143. This interpretation is
effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource adopted FIN 47 in the fourth
quarter 2005. Refer to Note 6, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS No. 157 — Fair Value Measurements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 to define
fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and to expand disclosures about fair
value measurements. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of SFAS No. 157 to determine
the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and
should be applied prospectively, with limited exceptions.

FIN 48 — Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN
48 to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and
measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, this interpretation
requires that a tax position meet a “more-likely-than-not recognition threshold” for the benefit of
an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements and requires that benefit to
be measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon
ultimate settlement. When determining whether a tax position meets this 50% threshold, it is to be
based on whether it is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities,
based solely on the technical merits of the position. This interpretation is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2006. NiSource will adopt the provisions of FIN 48 in the first
quarter of 2007. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of this interpretation to
determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Environmental Matters

NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated
with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations,
certain LDCs and CER. More significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas
less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations
using mercury-containing measuring equipment.

The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination at known sites will depend upon many
factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, the range of technologies
that can be used for remediation, other potentially responsible parties and their financial
viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. NiSource’s environmental liability
includes those corrective action costs considered “probable and reasonably estimable” under SFAS
No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96-1. NiSource’s estimated remediation liability will be refined as
events in the remediation process occur and actual remediation costs may differ materially from
NiSource’s estimates due to the dependence on the factors listed above.

Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United
States and worldwide to reduce so-called “greenhouse gases” such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of
burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage
in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently
a participant in the EPA’s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in
developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

Bargaining Unit Contract

As of December 31, 2006, NiSource had 7,349 employees of which 3,383 were subject to collective
bargaining agreements. One agreement, covering approximately 385 employees of Columbia of
Kentucky, Columbia of Ohio, and Columbia Transmission Company, expired December 1, 2006. The
company and the union reached a tentative agreement for a new five-year contract on February 16, 2006, which was then
ratified by the collective bargaining unit on February 26, 2007. Fifteen additional collective bargaining agreements, covering approximately 656 employees,
were to expire during 2007. To date, agreements have been reached and ratified with respect to
nine of those agreements. The remaining six agreements, covering approximately 227 employees,
expire between May 1, 2007 and August 20, 2007.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued)

Competition

Gas Distribution Operations compete with investor-owned, municipal, and cooperative electric
utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas
utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong
competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas.
Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial
markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates
are primarily driven by low-cost, coal-fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas
competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets
mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane-based heating which, over time, has
comprised a declining percentage of the overall market.

Market Conditions

Spot prices for the winter of 2006-2007 were primarily in the range
of $5.00 - $8.00/Dth. This was
a significant decrease from the prices experienced during the winter of 2005-2006 that were in the
$6.00-$15.00/Dth range, as a result of hurricane related production outages in the Gulf of Mexico.
Supply disruptions associated with the 2005 hurricanes were restored by the third quarter of 2006.

Entering the 2006-2007 winter season, storage levels were at record high levels. Unseasonably mild
weather for the months of November and December 2006 left national storage levels well above the
prior five year average. During the summer of 2006, prices ranged between $4.00 and $9.00/Dth.
However, gas storage reached above the prior five-year average. Through December 2006, the winter
of 2006-2007 price levels were primarily between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth.

All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state-approved recovery mechanisms that
provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as
pass-through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs
included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the
difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer
billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been
adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost.

The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non-traditional revenue sources within the
evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services
upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories
and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products
are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company
and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on-system
services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and
balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give
the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such
things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce
pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of
transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others
using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice
programs described below under “Regulatory Matters.”

Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities

The Gas Distribution Operations segment’s net capital expenditures and other investing activities
were $283.4 million in 2006 and are projected to be approximately $333.4 million in 2007. This
increase in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected increase in expenditures
for modernizing and upgrading facilities as well as the implementation of a standardized work
management system at certain distribution companies as part of a multi-year plan.

Regulatory Matters

Significant Rate Developments.

On February 1, 2007, Columbia of Kentucky filed a base rate case
requesting an increase in rates of $12.6 million, or approximately 8%. Included in the filing is a
request for approval of an accelerated main replacement cost recovery mechanism, in order to
facilitate replacement of certain parts of Columbia of Kentucky’s natural gas distribution system.
Also, included are proposals to help offset the effects of

recent usage declines and increased customer attrition. Hearings are expected to be held in the
second quarter of 2007, with new rates expected to be in effect by the third quarter.

On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a PBR
plan, which would freeze non-gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning
January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR
plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (“Investigation”) into the justness and
reasonableness of Columbia of Virginia’s current rates, charges and terms and conditions of
service

.

On December 12, 2006, Columbia of Virginia, VSCC Staff and all parties to the proceedings
presented a comprehensive settlement resolving all issues in the proceedings. The Hearing Examiner
recommended approval of the settlement in a report issued December 21, 2006 and the VSCC approved
the settlement by Order issued December 28, 2006. Among other things, the settlement, which became
effective January 1, 2007, establishes a PBR for a four-year period, freezing Columbia of
Virginia’s non-gas rates at their current levels and setting up an earnings sharing mechanism and
temporary rate credits during the PBR plan period, and contains a commitment by Columbia of
Virginia to expand its system to continue to meet growth needs.

On January 31, 2006, the IURC approved a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement between
Northern Indiana and other parties resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The new ARP is
effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services
including Northern Indiana’s Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and
adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the
company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on
base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement.

In mid 2006, Northern Indiana filed a petition which simplifies gas distribution rates, stabilizes
revenues and provides for energy efficiency funding. Northern Indiana filed its detailed case in
this proceeding in January 2007, based upon lengthy and detailed discussion with stakeholders. All
parties requested and the IURC has granted an expedited schedule in this proceeding. Northern
Indiana expects a final order in the cause in the second quarter of 2007.

Cost Recovery and Trackers.

A significant portion of the distribution companies’ revenue is
related to the recovery of gas costs, the review and recovery of which occurs via standard
regulatory proceedings. All states require periodic review of actual gas procurement activity to
determine prudence and to permit the recovery of prudently incurred costs related to the supply of
gas for customers. NiSource distribution companies have historically been found prudent in the
procurement of gas supplies to serve customers.

Certain operating costs of the NiSource distribution companies are significant, recurring in
nature, and generally outside the control of the distribution companies. Some states allow the
recovery of such costs via cost tracking mechanisms. Such tracking mechanisms allow for
abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the distribution companies to implement charges and
recover appropriate costs. Tracking mechanisms allow for more timely recovery of such costs as
compared with more traditional cost recovery mechanisms. Examples of such mechanisms include gas
cost recovery adjustment mechanisms, tax riders, and bad debt recovery mechanisms. Gas
Distribution Operations revenue is increased by the implementation and recovery of costs via such
tracking mechanisms.

Comparability of Gas Distribution Operations line item operating results is impacted by these
regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt
expenses. Increases in the expenses that are the subject of trackers result in a corresponding
increase in net revenues and therefore have essentially no impact on total operating income
results. Operating expenses increased by $50.5 million for expenses which are subject to such
trackers and are therefore primarily offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting
recovery of certain costs.

Certain of the NiSource distribution companies are embarking upon plans to replace significant
portions of their operating systems that are nearing the end of their useful life. Those companies
are currently evaluating requests for increases in rates in order to allow recovery of the
additional capital expenditures required for such plans. Each

LDC’s approach to cost recovery may be unique, given the different laws, regulations and precedent
that exist in each jurisdiction. Currently, Columbia of Pennsylvania and Columbia of Ohio are
evaluating such plans and filings.

Certain types of natural gas risers, which are owned by customers, on Columbia of Ohio’s
distribution system have been evaluated under a study required by the PUCO, and have been found to
be prone to leak natural gas under certain conditions. On February 1, 2007, Columbia of Ohio
announced plans to identify and replace these certain types of risers on its distribution system.
Columbia of Ohio estimates that the cost to identify and replace the risers will approximate $200
million, and will be seeking approval to implement an infrastructure replacement program cost
recovery mechanism.

Customer Usage.

The NiSource distribution companies continue to experience declining usage by
customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to historically high commodity prices. A
significant portion of the LDC’s operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at
the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon
throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Many of NiSource’s LDCs are evaluating mechanisms that
would “de-couple” the recovery of fixed costs from throughput, and implement recovery mechanisms
that more closely link the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. Each of the states that the
NiSource LDCs operate in has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such
changes.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of
December 31, 2006, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions.
Refer to Note 18-F, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment.

Restructuring

Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1
million during 2006 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2006 was $1.6
million. In the third quarter of 2006, an adjustment was made to the restructuring reserve for
leased office space, reducing the reserve by $5.2 million. This adjustment was made in connection
with a reallocation of office space and assessment of office facilities. Refer to Note 3,
“Restructuring Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment.

Weather

In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer
demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree-days. Normal is evaluated using
heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for
measuring heating degree-days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load
begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62
degrees.

Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2006 was approximately 12%
warmer than normal and 14% warmer than 2005, decreasing net revenues by approximately $89 million
for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005.

Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder
than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the
year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004.

Throughput

Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2006 were 826.9 MMDth, compared
to 864.4 MMDth for 2005. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential, commercial, and
industrial customers, which was attributable mainly to the milder weather and decreased residential
customer usage, partially offset by increased off-system sales.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued)

Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.4 MMDth, compared
to 899.1 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower industrial and off-system sales.

Net Revenues

Net revenues for 2006 were $1,421.6 million, a decrease of $83.3 million from 2005. This decrease
in net revenues was due primarily to the impact of warmer weather amounting to approximately $89
million and a decline in residential usage of approximately $22 million. Additionally, the prior
year was favorably impacted $12.1 million from a buyout of a large customer gas contract. These
decreases in net revenues were partially offset by a $46.7 million increase in revenues from
regulatory trackers, which are primarily offset in operating expenses.

Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues
grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder
weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers
that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of
regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from increases in gross receipts and excise taxes, which are
both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas
contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to
residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in
usage caused in part by higher gas prices experienced in 2005.

Operating Income

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations
segment was $290.0 million, a decrease of $78.2 million compared to the same period in 2005 largely
attributable to reduced net revenues described above. Operating expenses, excluding $50.5 million
of tracker expenses primarily offset in revenues, were $55.6 million lower than the prior year.
The comparable period last year was impacted by transition costs, restructuring charges and a
pension and other postretirement benefits charge totaling $49.4 million associated with the IBM
agreement, and a $10.9 million goodwill impairment loss related to Kokomo Gas. Operating expenses
were impacted this year by higher employee and administrative costs of $11.9 million, expenses
associated with the IBM agreement of $8.5 million primarily for transition services and higher
depreciation expense of $6.8 million, partially offset by a reversal in the third quarter of a
restructuring reserve for leased office space of $5.2 million and lower uncollectible accounts.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations
segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The
decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, excluding $42.2 million of
tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described
above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges and a
pension and postretirement benefit charge totaling $49.4 million associated with the IBM agreement.
Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0
million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for
Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in
association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and
administrative expenses of $7.4 million.

Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project

Millennium received FERC approval for a pipeline project, in which Columbia Transmission is
participating and will serve as operator, which will provide access to a number of supply and
storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The reconfigured project, which was approved
by the FERC in a certificate order issued December 21, 2006, will begin at an interconnect with
Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards
Syracuse, New York. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium
near Corning, New York. Millennium will extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas
Transmission Co. at Ramapo, New York.

The certificate order approved the project costs related to the construction and development of the
Millennium project as described above. The order also approved the vacating of portions of the
original September 2002 Millennium certificate that related to other facilities.

The Millennium owners no longer believe the recovery of the capitalized costs related to the
vacated portions of the project is probable. Therefore, Millennium has fully reserved the
capitalized costs related to the development of the vacated portions. NiSource recorded a $13
million charge reflecting its share of Millennium’s reserve during the fourth quarter of 2006.

The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related
pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred
to as the “Companion Pipelines.” The December 21, 2006 certificate order also granted the
necessary project approvals to the Companion Pipelines.

In addition, Millennium has received requested tax relief in New York. Millennium plans to begin
construction in Spring 2007 with a projected in-service date of November 1, 2008.

In March 2006, Columbia Atlantic Trading, a NiSource subsidiary, sold its 21.0% interest in the
Millennium partnership to KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corporation) and DTE Millennium
(owned by DTE Energy Co.) through an equity redistribution and a re-writing of the partnership
agreements. The Millennium partnership is now currently made up of the following companies:
Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (26.25%), and KeySpan Millennium (26.25%). Columbia
Transmission will be the operator. The FERC Order reflected these reconfigured ownership levels.

Hardy Storage Project

In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to
jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market
demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Hardy Storage was then formed by Columbia
Transmission and Piedmont to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas
production field in West Virginia. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately
12 Bcf of natural gas, is expected to be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service
on behalf of the subscribing customers. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity
interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities.

Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with
the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received favorable orders on November 1, 2005. On October 26,
2006, Hardy Storage filed an application seeking to amend the November 1, 2005 order to revise the
initial rates and estimated costs for the project pursuant to executed settlement agreements with
Hardy Storage’s customers. The amendment application is uncontested and Hardy Storage has
requested expedited FERC action on the filing by February 28, 2007.

On June 29, 2006, Columbia Transmission, Piedmont, and Hardy Storage entered into multiple
agreements to finance the construction of Hardy Storage. Under the financing agreement, Columbia
Transmission issued guarantees securing payment for amounts issued in connection with Hardy Storage
up until such time as the project is placed in service and satisfies certain performance criteria.
Additional information on this guarantee is provided in Note 18-C, “Guarantees and Indemnities,”
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Construction began in the first quarter of 2006
and Hardy Storage is expected to be placed in service in the second quarter of 2007.

Other Growth Projects

Eastern Market Expansion, a combined storage and transportation project designed to meet core
market growth in the mid-Atlantic region that already has binding customer agreements, continues
with NEPA pre-filing activities. Columbia Transmission anticipates filing a certificate
application with the FERC in April 2007.

Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment’s capital expenditures and other investing
activities were $208.1 million in 2006 and $167.9 million in 2005. This increase was primarily due
to incremental pipeline expenditures including pipeline integrity costs in compliance with the
DOT’s Integrity Management Rule. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment’s capital
expenditure program and other investing activities are projected to be approximately $19 million
higher in 2007. The increase in capital is due to storage and transportation growth projects in
key market areas which are served by the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment.

Pipeline Firm Service Contracts

Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990’s, the services of Columbia
Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open
access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided
primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and
Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized
a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued)

contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and
Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years.
These reductions were partially offset by incremental revenues of approximately $27 million that
resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts during 2005 and 2006.

Sales of Shorter-Term Transportation and Storage Services

Seasonal price fluctuations in the national energy market created opportunities for customers to
utilize existing shorter-term transportation and storage tariff services provided by Columbia
Transmission and Columbia Gulf. A commercial team is in place focused on this effort to capitalize
on market opportunities. Columbia Transmission entered into contracts that represent revenues in
excess of $45 million of shorter-term business for 2006. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf
plan to continue offering these short term transportation and storage services. Customer
requirements for these services will vary according to market conditions which include such factors
as commodity price volatility, geographic price differentials and the physical capacity and
capabilities of the pipeline network.

Regulatory Matters

Significant FERC Developments.

On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the “Order on Accounting for
Pipeline Assessment Costs.” This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application
across the industry for accounting of the DOT’s Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of
the guidance was January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs have been recorded as operating
expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to
January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. In November, 2005, the INGAA sought
review of the matter before the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (INGAA V. FERC, No.
05-1426). Oral Argument was presented before the Court on January 16, 2007 and a ruling is
currently pending.

On July 20, 2006, the FERC issued a declaratory order in response to a petition filed by Tennessee
Gas Pipeline. The petition related to a Tennessee Gas Pipeline request to establish an
interconnection with the Columbia Gulf operated portion of the Blue Water Pipeline system.
Columbia Gulf has a long-standing practice of providing interconnections with other interstate
pipelines only as long as there is an interconnection agreement in place that governs the rules of
the interconnection. Among other things, these agreements help protect the integrity of Columbia
Gulf’s system and the reliability of service to its customers. The FERC ruled that Tennessee Gas
Pipeline’s interconnection request should be governed by the existing Blue Water Pipeline Operating
Agreement between Columbia Gulf and Tennessee Gas Pipeline. Columbia Gulf constructed the
necessary taps and Tennessee Gas Pipeline then completed its portion of the interconnection
facilities. The interconnection was ready to flow gas on October 1, 2006. On December 29, 2006,
Columbia Gulf filed in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals a Petition for Review of the Commission’s
July 20, 2006 order and a subsequent order denying Columbia Gulf’s Request for Rehearing.

In the declaratory order, the FERC also referred the matter to the Office of Enforcement to
determine if there should be any action taken against Columbia Gulf for failing to comply with
prior orders that directed Columbia Gulf to allow Tennessee Gas Pipeline to make an
interconnection. While disappointed with the FERC’s referral of this matter to the Office of
Enforcement, Columbia Gulf has cooperated with the Office of Enforcement’s investigation. Columbia
Gulf expects the staff will complete its investigation in the near future, but is unable to predict
the outcome at this time.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
segment. As of December 31, 2006, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental
response actions. Refer to Note 18-F, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations segment.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued)

Restructuring

Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
amounted to $2.8 million during 2006 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2006
was $2.2 million. Refer to Note 3, “Restructuring Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations segment.

Throughput

Columbia Transmission’s throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and
other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid-Atlantic,
midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf
reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short-haul
transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in
northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and
Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this
segment.

Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,178.0 MMDth for 2006,
compared to 1,172.1 MMDth in 2005. The increase of 5.9 MMDth is due to increased sales of
shorter-term transportation and storage services described above, partially offset by lower gas
deliveries by Columbia Transmission.

Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005,
compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were
offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission.

Net Revenues

Net revenues were $850.5 million for 2006, an increase of $40.0 million from 2005. The increase in
net revenues was mainly due to sales of shorter-term transportation and storage services amounting
to $43.9 million and increased subscriptions for demand services of $12.8 million. The comparable
period last year benefited from a third-party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the
rejection of a shipper’s long-term contract, which amounted to $8.9 million.

Net revenues were $810.5 million for 2005, a decrease of $22.1 million from 2004. The decrease was
primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers,
which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory
trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net
revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from
remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by an $8.9 million third-party buyout of a
bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shipper’s long-term contract.

Operating Income

Operating income of $340.8 million in 2006 decreased $3.6 million from 2005 primarily due to
increased operations and maintenance expenses of $30.2 million and a $12.3 million loss on equity
earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, which offset the increase in net revenues described
above. The loss on equity earnings resulted from a $13 million charge reflecting NiSource’s Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations segment share of Millennium’s reserve related to vacated
portions of the original project. Operation and maintenance expenses increased as a result of
$18.1 million accrued for litigation relating to several matters, some which were settled during
the fourth quarter, higher employee and administrative costs of $9.4 million, increased pipeline
integrity related costs of $7.3 million, and increased property insurance premiums of $6.5 million
mainly for offshore and onshore facilities located in or near the Gulf of Mexico. The increases in
property insurance were driven by the losses experienced by the insurance industry over the past
few years, resulting from hurricanes such as Ivan, Katrina and Rita. The operation and maintenance
expense increases were partially offset by the impact in the comparable 2005 period of transition
costs, a restructuring charge and a pension and other postretirement benefit charge totaling $12.8
million associated with the IBM agreement.

Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the
reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of
tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges,
including a pension and other post retirement

benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million.
These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in
pension expense.

Market Conditions

The regulatory frameworks applicable to Electric Operations continue to be affected by fundamental
changes that will impact Electric Operations’ structure and profitability. Notwithstanding those
changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and
revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing
environment.

The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international
competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has
responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position
in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered
production costs and increased productivity, reducing the

labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. NiSource
continued to see strength in industrial sales volumes, up 4% over 2005 levels, due largely to the
steel market and related industries.

Northern Indiana has identified a need for additional resources to meet its electric customers’
demand in the coming years. To assess options to meet this need, a Request for Proposal for
purchases of power (including renewable energy) and demand reducing options was issued. The bids
are to provide power in the short term as well separate bids to provide power in the long term.
These bids are being evaluated and compared to other options including building a power plant,
acquiring a portion of an existing plant, entering into a natural gas purchase contract to provide
low cost gas for power production and restarting the Mitchell Station. No commitment to pursue any
specific option or group of options has been made. Management anticipates that the evaluation of
options will continue through early 2007.

Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities

The Electric Operations segment’s capital expenditures and other investing activities were $151.2
million in 2006 and are projected to be approximately $236.8 million in 2007. The increase is due
to higher expenditures for the NOx reduction programs and expenditures to replace key components
within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $4
million in 2006 and are budgeted to be approximately $37 million for 2007.

Regulatory Matters

Significant Rate Developments.

To settle a proceeding regarding Northern Indiana’s request to
recover intermediate dispatchable power costs, Northern Indiana has agreed to file an electric base
rate case on or before July 1, 2008.

During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate
review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement.
The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will
receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225
million, for the minimum 49-month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The credits will continue
beyond the minimum period at the same annual level and per the same methodology, until the IURC
enters a basic rate order that approves revised Northern Indiana’s electric rates subsequent to the
minimum period. The order included a rate moratorium that expired on July 31, 2006. The order
also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by
Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times
of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $50.9
million and $58.5 million were recognized for electric customers for the years ended December 31,
2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively.

MISO.

As part of Northern Indiana’s participation in the MISO transmission service and wholesale
energy market, certain administrative fees and non-fuel costs have been incurred. IURC Orders have
been issued authorizing the deferral for consideration in a future rate case proceeding the
administrative fees and non-fuel related costs incurred after Northern Indiana’s rate moratorium,
which expired on July 31, 2006. During 2006 the administrative fees totaled $5.5 million. Of this
amount, $3.0 million was expensed and $2.5 million was deferred. Non-fuel costs were $12.8 million
in 2006, of which $11.5 million was expensed and $1.3 million was deferred. On May 4, 2006, the
IURC issued a final order authorizing the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as
fuel-related and therefore recoverable through the FAC mechanism. As a result of this order
Northern Indiana realized an increase in net revenues of $7.9 million.

On April 25, 2006, the FERC issued an order on the MISO’s Transmission and Energy Markets Tariff,
stating that MISO had violated the tariff on several issues including not assessing revenue
sufficiency guarantee charges on virtual bids and offers and for charging revenue sufficiency
guarantee charges on imports. The FERC ordered MISO to perform a resettlement of these charges
back to April 1, 2005. Although the amount of resettlements applicable to Northern Indiana cannot
be quantified at this time, it is not expected to be material.

Cost Recovery and Trackers.

A significant portion of the Northern Indiana’s revenue is related to
the recovery of fuel costs to generate power and the fuel costs related to purchased power. These
costs are recovered through a standard, quarterly, “summary” regulatory proceeding in Indiana
(FAC). Northern Indiana has historically been found prudent in the procurement of fuel and
purchased power.

In July 2006, the IURC issued an order creating a sub-docket in FAC 71 based upon a motion by
interveners, the Industrial Group and La Porte County. The motion requested an investigation into
Northern Indiana’s generation and purchases practices that could not be fully considered in a
summary proceeding. The sub-docket will also address concerns raised by the OUCC related to the
reasonableness of recovering financial hedging transactions within the FAC. Subsequently, the IURC
has approved FAC 72 and FAC 73 subject to the sub-docket in FAC 71. Amounts collected pursuant to
FAC 71, 72 and 73 are subject to refund based upon the final order in the sub-docket.

On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern
Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by
Northern Indiana to implement IDEM’s NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related
operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become
operational through an EERM. Under the IURC’s November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is
permitted to submit filings on a semi-annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the
EERM. On December 13, 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indiana’s latest compliance plan with the
estimate of $312.8 million. On March 29, 2006 the IURC approved EER-3 for operating expenses of
$18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On September 28, 2006 the IURC approved ECR-8 for capital
expenditure (net of accumulated depreciation) of $226.8 million. Northern Indiana filed ECR-9 and
EER-4 on February 7, 2007 for net capital expenditures of $222.2 million and $14.1 million in
operating expenses.

On December 8, 2006, Northern Indiana filed a petition requesting a certificate of public
convenience and necessity for clean coal technology projects, to address the first phase of CAIR
and CAMR. The request included initiating ongoing review of the construction of the projects; finding that the projects
constitute “qualified pollution control property” and are eligible for the rate-making treatment;
finding that the projects constitute “clean coal and energy projects” and finding that the projects
are reasonable and necessary and therefore eligible for the financial incentives; approving
accounting, rate-making treatment, cost recovery and other relief in connection with Northern
Indiana’s clean coal technology, qualified pollution control property and clean coal and energy
projects. Testimony was filed in February 2007 requesting approval of $23 million of cost estimates for the projects.

Mitchell Station.

In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station.
In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the
Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length
of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana, with input from a broad based
stakeholder group, is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell Station facility
in light of Northwest Indiana’s need for that property and the substantial costs associated with
restarting the facility including the potential increase in level of environmental controls
required.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December
31, 2006, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to
Note 18-F, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment.

Restructuring

No amounts for restructuring were recorded in 2006 for Electric Operations. Electric Operations
recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with NiSource’s outsourcing
agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments
made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations were $0.1 million during 2005 and
the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005 and 2006, was zero. Refer to Note 3,
“Restructuring Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment.

NiSource Inc.

Electric Operations (continued)

Sales

Electric Operations sales were 17,428.3 gwh for the year 2006, a slight decrease of 58.7 gwh
compared to 2005, mainly resulting from decreased residential sales due to milder weather. This
decrease was partially offset by increased industrial volumes, particularly in the steel sector.

Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh
compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due
primarily to warmer weather and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was
partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales.

Net Revenues

Electric Operations net revenues were $822.4 million for 2006, an increase of $27.3 million from
2005, due to $13.5 million of lower unrecoverable MISO costs included in cost of sales, $10.7
million from proceeds received for emissions allowances, a reduction in customer credits of $7.7
million, due to the timing of the credits, increased environmental tracker revenues of $7.4 million
(offset in expense), an increase in residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately
$6 million and increased industrial volumes. The lower unrecoverable MISO costs resulted mainly
from the IURC’s ruling on the recoverability of certain MISO costs as well as the deferral of
certain costs for future recovery which began on August 1, 2006. These increases in net revenues
were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable weather compared to the prior year of
approximately $21 million.

Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from
2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million
compared to the 2004 period, and increased non-weather related usage and customer count totaling
$24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which
$6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially
offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million
reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the
purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy.

Operating Income

Operating income for 2006 was $310.4 million, an increase of $17.1 million from 2005. The increase
in operating income was due to the changes in net revenue mentioned above, partially offset by
higher operating expenses of $10.2 million. Operating expenses increased due to higher electric
generation and maintenance expense of $9.3 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of
approximately $3.3 million and $4.8 million in increased other taxes compared to the same period in
2005. The change in operation and maintenance expense was favorably impacted by transition costs,
a restructuring charge and a pension and other postretirement benefit charge totaling $8.4 million
associated with the IBM agreement made in the comparable 2005 period.

Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease
was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses
associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The
increase in operating expenses were partially offset by higher net revenues described above. The
operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a
pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing
and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of
$7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other
tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax
accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of
which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue.

Whiting Clean Energy.

On December 18, 2006, Whiting Clean Energy and BP executed Amendment IV
which materially amended the terms of the ESA under which Whiting Clean Energy provides steam to
BP. The agreement specifies a planned termination of the ESA at the end of 2009, with options for
BP to extend the term one additional year under renegotiated steam pricing. Whiting Clean Energy
accrued $17.0 million in costs associated with contract termination terms under the agreement. In
addition, Amendment IV provides BP an option, valid for 180 days from the Amendment’s effective
date, for BP to purchase the facility free of liens for $100 million. Management believes it is
unlikely that BP will exercise this option. The carrying amount of the Whiting Clean Energy
facility is approximately $275 million.

Because of continued losses from Whiting Clean Energy and the amended terms of the agreement
between Whiting Clean Energy and BP (discussed above), an impairment study was performed during
2006. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 144, an impairment loss shall be recognized only if the
carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The test
compares the carrying amount of the long lived asset to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. The study indicated that no
impairment charge was necessary.

The study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 35-year estimated useful life of the
facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as electricity and natural gas forward
prices and price volatility, impacts from the terms and options set forth under the definitive
agreement with BP as discussed above, and utilization of the facility, could result in a situation
where total undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would
result in a write-down that could be significant.

Lake Erie Land Company, Inc.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of
$2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations
of the golf club as discontinued operations. In June 2006, the assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club,
valued at $11.9 million, and additional properties were sold to a private real estate development
group. An after-tax loss of $0.2 million was recorded in June 2006. As a result of the June 2006
transaction, property estimated to be sold to the private developer during the next twelve months
has been recorded as assets held for sale.

NDC Douglas Properties

NDC Douglas Properties, a subsidiary of NiSource Development Company, is in the process of exiting
some of its low income housing investments. Two of these investments were disposed of during 2006
and three other investments are expected to be sold or disposed of during 2007. An impairment loss
of $2.3 million was recorded in the first half of 2006, due to the current book value exceeding the
estimated fair value of these investments. NiSource has accounted for the investments to be sold
as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations.

NiSource Inc.

Other Operations (continued)

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Other Operations segment. As of December 31,
2006, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note
18-F, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment.

Net Revenues

For the year ended 2006, net operating revenues were $36.2 million, a decrease of $5.9 million from
2005. The decrease was mainly due to decreased revenues from the operation of the Whiting Clean
Energy facility partially offset by increased commercial and industrial gas marketing revenues of
$2.1 million.

For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $42.1 million, an increase of $22.5 million
from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and
$7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers.

Operating Loss

The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $40.2 million in 2006, an increased loss
of $27.9 million from the 2005 period, due to increased losses associated with Whiting Clean
Energy, including contract termination costs with BP of $17.0 million incurred in the fourth
quarter of 2006, and increased scheduled maintenance costs of $7.2 million for Whiting Clean
Energy, partially offset by a reduction in uncollectible accounts of $4.0 million and $2.1 million
of increased revenues from commercial and industrial gas marketing.

The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.3 million in 2005 compared to an
operating loss of $30.5 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased
losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial
and industrial gas marketing.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of NiSource Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, statements of consolidated
capitalization and long-term debt of NiSource Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December
31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, common stockholders’ equity
and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2006. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item
8. We also have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial
statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedules, an opinion on management’s assessment, and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit of financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment that
the



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission

.

As explained in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, effective December 31, 2005, the
Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting
for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations.” As explained in Note 11 to the consolidated
financial statements, effective December 31, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 158,
“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”.

ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

A. Company Structure and Principles of Consolidation.

NiSource, a Delaware corporation, is a
holding company whose subsidiaries provide natural gas, electricity and other products and services
to approximately 3.8 million customers located within a corridor that runs from the Gulf Coast
through the Midwest to New England. NiSource is a holding company under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 2005. NiSource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the
operating results of its 15 direct subsidiaries.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NiSource and its majority-owned
subsidiaries after the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. Investments for
which at least a 20% interest is owned, certain joint ventures and limited partnership interests of
more than 3% are accounted for under the equity method. Except where noted above and in the event
where NiSource has significant influence, investments with less than a 20% interest are accounted
for under the cost method. NiSource also consolidates variable interest entities for which
NiSource is the primary beneficiary as a result of the adoption in January 2003 of FIN No. 46R.

B. Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

C. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash.

NiSource considers all investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. NiSource reports amounts deposited in
brokerage accounts for margin requirements as restricted cash. In addition, NiSource has amounts
deposited in trust to satisfy requirements for the provision of various property, liability,
workers compensation, and long-term disability insurance, which is classified as restricted cash
and disclosed as an investing cash flow on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.

Restricted cash was $142.5 million and $33.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively. The increase in restricted cash was due primarily to the decline in forward
gas prices in the latter half of 2006 which resulted in increased margin deposits on open
derivative contracts.

D. Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenue.

Accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets includes both billed and unbilled amounts as NiSource believes that total accounts
receivable is a more meaningful presentation, given the factors which impact both billed and
unbilled accounts receivable. Unbilled revenue is based on estimated amounts of electric energy or
natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its customers. Unbilled amounts of accounts receivable
relate to a portion of a customer’s consumption of gas or electricity from the date of the last
cycle billing date through the last day of the month (balance sheet date). Factors taken into
consideration when estimating unbilled revenue include historical usage, customer rates and
weather. Accounts receivable fluctuates from year to year depending upon seasonality and price
volatility. NiSource’s accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes unbilled
revenue, less reserves, in the amounts of $250.2 million and $437.6 million for the years ended
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

E. Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.

NiSource’s investments in debt and marketable
securities are carried at fair value and are designated as available-for-sale. These investments
are included within “Other investments” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and
losses, net of deferred income taxes, are reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income.
These investments are monitored for other than temporary declines in market value. Realized gains
and losses and permanent impairments are reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Income.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, approximately $39 million of investments were pledged as collateral
for trust accounts related to NiSource’s wholly owned insurance company.

F. Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.

NiSource’s rate-regulated subsidiaries
follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. SFAS No. 71 provides that
rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the
economic effect of the way in which regulators



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the
regulated service and it is probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain
expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in
income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related
amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers.

In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its
costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the
criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write-down of all or a portion of
NiSource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery
was approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally
accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during
such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable
amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required
to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In management’s opinion, NiSource’s regulated
subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future.

Regulatory assets and liabilities were comprised of the following items:

With the adoption of SFAS No. 158 NiSource determined that for certain rate-regulated
subsidiaries the future recovery of pension and other postretirement plans costs is probable in
accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 71. These rate-regulated subsidiaries recorded
amounts that would otherwise have been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income to a
regulatory asset account. Refer to Note 2, “Recent Accounting Pronouncements,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Regulatory assets of approximately $1,383.0 million are not presently included in rate base and
consequently are not earning a return on investment. The regulatory assets covered by
specific regulatory orders are being recovered as components of cost of service over a
remaining life of up to 25 years. Regulatory assets of approximately $68.3 million require
specific rate action.

G. Utility Plant and Other Property and Related Depreciation and Maintenance.

Property, plant and
equipment (principally utility plant) are stated at cost. The rate-regulated subsidiaries record
depreciation using composite rates on a straight-line basis over the remaining service lives of the
electric, gas and common properties.

For rate-regulated companies, an AFUDC is capitalized on all classes of property except
organization, land, autos, office equipment, tools and other general property purchases. The
allowance is applied to construction costs for that period of time between the date of the
expenditure and the date on which such project is completed and placed in service. The pre-tax
rate for AFUDC was 5.5% in 2006, 2.5% in 2005, and 2.5% in 2004. Short-term borrowings were
primarily used to fund construction efforts for all three years presented. The increase in the
2006 AFUDC rate, as compared with 2005, was due to higher short-term interest rates and an increase
in the level of funding capital projects with long-term financing and equity.

The depreciation provisions for utility plant, as a percentage of the original cost, for the
periods ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:




Electric Operations

3.5

The Whiting Clean Energy facility owned by PEI, a consolidated subsidiary of NiSource, is
being depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 40-year useful life.

Generally, NiSource’s subsidiaries follow the practice of charging maintenance and repairs,
including the cost of removal of minor items of property, to expense as incurred. When property
that represents a retired unit is replaced or removed, the cost of such property is credited to
utility plant, and such cost, net of salvage, is charged to the accumulated provision for
depreciation.

H. Carrying Charges and Deferred Depreciation.

Upon completion of units 17 and 18 at the R. M.
Schahfer Generating Station, Northern Indiana capitalized the carrying charges and deferred
depreciation in accordance with orders of the IURC, pending the inclusion of the cost of each unit
in rates. Such carrying charges and deferred depreciation are being amortized over the remaining
service life of each unit.

Northern Indiana has capitalized carrying charges and deferred depreciation and certain operating
expenses relating to its scrubber service agreement for its Bailly Generating Station in accordance
with an order of the IURC. The accumulated balance of the deferred costs and related carrying
charges is being amortized over the remaining life of the scrubber service agreement.

In the Columbia of Ohio 1999 rate agreement, the PUCO authorized Columbia of Ohio to revise its
depreciation accrual rates for the period January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2004. The revised
depreciation rates were lower than those which would have been utilized if Columbia of Ohio were
not subject to regulation and, accordingly, a regulatory asset had been established for the
difference. The amount of depreciation that would have been recorded for 2004 had Columbia of Ohio
not been subject to rate regulation is $36.4 million.

In 2005, the PUCO authorized Columbia of Ohio to revise its depreciation accrual rates for the
period beginning January 1, 2005. The revised depreciation rates are now higher than those which
would have been utilized if Columbia of Ohio were not subject to regulation. Accordingly, the
accumulated regulatory asset balance of $131.7 million through December 31, 2004 has been reduced
in 2005 and 2006. The amount of depreciation that would have been recorded for 2005 had Columbia
of Ohio not been subject to rate regulation is $35.2 million, a $6.1 million decrease over the
$41.3 million reflected in rates. The amount of depreciation that would have been recorded for
2006 had Columbia of Ohio not been subject to rate regulation is $34.9 million, a $6.0 million
decrease over the $40.9 million reflected in rates. Consequently, the regulatory asset was $119.6
million as of December 31, 2006.

I. Amortization of Software Costs.

External and internal costs associated with computer software
developed for internal use are capitalized. Capitalization of such costs commences upon the
completion of the preliminary stage of each project in accordance with SOP 98-1. Once the
installed software is ready for its intended use, such capitalized costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis generally over a period of five years. NiSource amortized $20.6 million in
2006, $28.3 million in 2005 and $35.0 million in 2004 related to software costs.

J. Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

NiSource has approximately $4.1 billion in goodwill and other
intangible assets. Substantially all goodwill relates to the excess of cost over the fair value of
the net assets acquired in the Columbia acquisition. In addition, NiSource has other intangible
assets consisting primarily of franchise rights apart from goodwill that were identified as part of
the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisitions of Bay State, Northern Utilities,
which is a subsidiary of Bay State, and Granite, all of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of
NiSource, which are being amortized over forty years from the date of acquisition. NiSource
accounts for its intangible assets, including goodwill, in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Refer to
Note 5, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information.

K. Long-lived Assets.

NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets contains significant long-lived
assets other than goodwill and intangible assets discussed above which are not subject to recovery
under SFAS No. 71. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of
these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be
impaired as per SFAS No. 144.

PEI’s Whiting Clean Energy project at BP’s Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002.
Because of continued losses from Whiting Clean Energy and the amended terms of the agreement
between Whiting Clean Energy and BP (discussed below), an impairment study was performed during
2006. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 144, an impairment loss shall be recognized only if the
carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The test
compares the carrying amount of the long lived asset to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. The study indicated that no
impairment was necessary.

On December 18, 2006, Whiting Clean Energy and BP executed Amendment IV which materially amended
the terms of the ESA under which Whiting Clean Energy provides steam to BP. The agreement
specifies a planned termination of the ESA at the end of 2009, with options for BP to extend the
term one additional year under renegotiated steam pricing. Whiting Clean Energy accrued $17.0
million in costs associated with contract termination terms under the agreement. In addition,
Amendment IV provides BP an option, valid for 180 days from the Amendment’s effective date, for BP
to purchase the facility free of liens for $100 million. Management believes it is unlikely that
BP will exercise this option. The carrying amount of the Whiting Clean Energy facility is
approximately $275 million.

In the second quarter of 2005, NiSource recognized a $10.9 million impairment for certain obsolete
software systems due to the outsourcing initiative with IBM.

L. Revenue Recognition.

With the exception of amounts recognized for energy trading activities,
revenues are recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to
customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include
estimates for electricity and gas delivered. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to
be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery
of the commodities.

Revenues relating to energy trading operations are recorded based upon changes in the fair values,
net of reserves, of the related energy trading contracts. Changes in the fair values of energy
trading contracts are recognized in revenues net of associated costs. Gains and losses relating to
non-trading derivatives designated as cash flow or fair value hedges are reported on a gross basis,
upon settlement, in the same income statement category as the related hedged item. Normal purchase
or sale contracts are reported on a gross basis upon settlement and recorded in the corresponding
income statement category based on commodity type.

M. Earnings Per Share.

Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders
by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The weighted
average shares outstanding for diluted EPS include the incremental effects of the various long-term
incentive compensation plans.

The numerator in calculating both basic and diluted EPS for each year is reported net income. The
computation of diluted average common shares follows:

N. Estimated Rate Refunds.

Certain rate-regulated subsidiaries collect revenues subject to
refund pending final determination in rate proceedings. In connection with such revenues,
estimated rate refund liabilities are recorded which reflect management’s current judgment of the
ultimate outcomes of the proceedings. No provisions are made when, in the opinion of management,
the facts and circumstances preclude a reasonable estimate of the outcome.

O. Accounts Receivable Sales Program.

NiSource enters into agreements with third parties to sell
certain accounts receivable without recourse. These sales are reflected as reductions of accounts
receivable in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and as operating cash flows in the
accompanying Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. The costs of these programs, which are based
upon the purchasers’ level of investment and borrowing costs, are charged to Other, net in the
accompanying Statements of Consolidated Income.

P. Fuel Adjustment Clause.

All metered electric rates contain a provision for adjustment to
reflect increases and decreases in the cost of fuel and the fuel cost of purchased power through
operation of a fuel adjustment clause. As prescribed by order of the IURC applicable to metered
retail rates, the adjustment factor has been calculated based on the estimated cost of fuel and the
fuel cost of purchased power in a future three-month period. If two statutory requirements
relating to expense and return levels are satisfied, any under-recovery or over-recovery caused by
variances between estimated and actual costs in a given three-month period are recorded as
adjustments to revenue and will be included in a future filing. Northern Indiana records any
under-recovery or over-recovery as a current regulatory asset or liability until such time as it is
billed or refunded to its customers. The fuel adjustment factor is subject to a quarterly hearing
by the IURC and remains in effect for a three-month period.

Q. Gas Cost Adjustment Clause.

All of NiSource’s Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries except
for Northern Indiana defer most differences between gas purchase costs and the recovery of such
costs in revenues, and adjust future billings for such deferrals on a basis consistent with
applicable state-approved tariff provisions. Northern Indiana adjusts its revenues for differences
between amounts collected from customers and actual gas costs and adjusts future billings for such
deferrals on a basis consistent with applicable state-approved tariff provisions.

R. Gas Inventory.

Both the LIFO inventory methodology and the weighted average methodology are
used to value natural gas in storage. The application of different methodologies is due to the
acquisition of Bay State. Bay State uses the weighted average cost of gas method, as approved by
state regulators, in setting its rates while both Northern Indiana and the Columbia subsidiaries
use the LIFO methodology when setting rates in their respective jurisdictions. Inventory valued
using LIFO was $471.5 million and $445.4 million at December 31, 2006, and 2005, respectively.
Based on the average cost of gas using the LIFO method, the estimated replacement cost of gas in
storage at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, exceeded the stated LIFO cost by $363.0 million
and $922.4 million, respectively. Inventory valued using the weighted average methodology was
$79.0 million at December 31, 2006 and $81.5 million at December 31, 2005.

S. Accounting for Exchange and Balancing Arrangements of Natural Gas.

NiSource’s Gas Transmission
and Storage and Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries enter into balancing and exchange
arrangements of natural gas as part of their operations and off-system sales programs. NiSource
records a receivable or payable for their respective cumulative gas imbalances and for any gas
borrowed or lent under an exchange agreement. These receivables and payables are recorded as
“Exchange gas receivable” or “Exchange gas payable” on NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, as
appropriate.

T. Accounting for Emissions Allowances.

Northern Indiana has obtained SO2 and NOx emissions
allowances from the EPA based upon its electric generation operations that the utility may sell,
trade or hold for future use. Northern Indiana utilizes the inventory model in accounting for
these emissions allowances, whereby these allowances were recognized at zero cost upon receipt from
the EPA. The utility defers proceeds from the sale of certain allowances as regulatory liabilities
to be applied for customer benefit. The sale of other allowances not used due to investments made
by NiSource in pollution control assets and services are reflected in earnings in the period in
which they occur and are included in net cash flows from operating activities in NiSource’s
Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.

U. Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities.

SFAS No. 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging
activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, unless such contracts are exempted as
normal under the provisions of the standard. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a
derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation.

NiSource uses a variety of derivative instruments (exchange traded futures and options, physical
forwards and options, financial commodity swaps, and interest rate swaps) to effectively manage its
commodity price risk and interest rate risk exposure. If certain conditions are met, a derivative
may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a
recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to
variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. In order for a derivative contract to be
designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or
transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the
hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated.
Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recognized currently in earnings.

Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other
comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such
derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective
portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in
earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. If a forecasted transaction
corresponding to a cash flow hedge is not expected to occur, the accumulated gains or losses on the
derivative are recognized currently in earnings. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are
recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a
result of the rate-making process, the rate-regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and
losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both
the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in
earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. When gains and losses are
recognized in earnings, they are recognized in cost of sales for derivatives that correspond to
commodity risk activities and are recognized in interest expense for derivatives that correspond to
interest-rate risk activities.

Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating
profits on, or from exposure to, shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the
contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under
SFAS No. 133. Trading contracts not meeting the criteria to be accounted for as derivatives under
SFAS No. 133 are recorded at fair value under EITF No. 02-03. EITF No. 02-03 indicates that when
certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including “energy-related contracts” such as
tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to
market) along with any related derivative contracts. The resulting gains and losses resulting from
marking these contracts to fair value are reported on a net basis and included currently in
earnings. Refer to Note 8, “Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

V. Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits.

NiSource records income taxes to recognize full
interperiod tax allocations. Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are provided for
the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to
future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of
existing assets and liabilities. Previously recorded investment tax credits of the regulated
subsidiaries were deferred and are being amortized over the life of the related properties to
conform to regulatory policy.

To the extent certain deferred income taxes of the regulated companies are recoverable or payable
through future rates, regulatory assets and liabilities have been established. Regulatory assets
for income taxes are primarily attributable to property related tax timing differences for which
deferred taxes had not been provided in the past, when regulators did not recognize such taxes as
costs in the rate-making process. Regulatory liabilities for income taxes are primarily
attributable to the regulated companies’ obligation to credit to ratepayers deferred income taxes
provided at rates higher than the current federal income tax rate currently being credited to
ratepayers using the average rate assumption method and unamortized deferred investment tax
credits.

NiSource files consolidated federal and state income tax returns with certain of its affiliated
companies. NiSource and its subsidiaries are parties to a tax allocation agreement under which the
consolidated tax is allocated among the members of the group in proportion to each member’s
relative contribution to the group’s consolidated tax liability. In addition, the separate company
tax benefits associated with NiSource’s tax losses, excluding tax benefits from interest expense on
acquisition debt, are allocated to NiSource’s subsidiaries with separate return tax.

W. Environmental Expenditures.

NiSource accrues for costs associated with environmental
remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs is probable and the amounts can be
reasonably estimated, regardless of when the expenditures are actually made. The undiscounted estimated future expenditures are
based on currently enacted laws and regulations, existing technology and estimated site-specific
costs where assumptions may be made about the nature and extent of site contamination, the extent
of cleanup efforts, costs of alternative cleanup methods and other variables. The liability is
adjusted as further information is discovered or circumstances change. The reserves for estimated
environmental expenditures are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in “Other accruals” for
short-term portions of these liabilities and “Other noncurrent liabilities” for the respective
long-term portions of these liabilities. Rate-regulated subsidiaries applying SFAS No. 71
establish regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the extent that future recovery
of environmental remediation costs is probable through the regulatory process.

In addition, Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC in 2003 to recover costs associated
with environmental compliance programs for NOx pollution-reduction equipment at Northern Indiana’s
generating stations. Refer to Note 7, “Regulatory Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information.

X. Excise Taxes.

NiSource accounts for excise taxes that are customer liabilities by separately
stating on its invoices the tax to its customers and recording amounts invoiced as liabilities
payable to the applicable taxing jurisdiction. These types of taxes, comprised largely of sales
taxes collected, are presented on a net basis affecting neither revenues nor cost of sales.
NiSource accounts for other taxes for which it is liable by recording a liability for the expected
tax with a corresponding charge to “Other taxes” expense.

2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS No. 158 — Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158 to improve existing reporting for defined benefit
postretirement plans by requiring employers to recognize in the statement of financial position the
overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan, among other changes. In
the fourth quarter of 2006, NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158 requiring employers to
recognize in the statement of financial position the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined
benefit postretirement plan, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets
and the benefit obligation. Based on the measurement of the various defined benefit



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

pension and other postretirement plans’ assets and benefit obligations at September 30, 2006, the pretax impact
of adopting SFAS No. 158 decreased intangible assets by $46.5 million, decreased deferred charges
and other assets by $1.1 million, increased regulatory assets by $538.8 million, increased
accumulated other comprehensive income by $239.8 million and increased accrued liabilities for
postretirement and postemployment benefits by $251.4 million. With the adoption of SFAS No. 158
NiSource determined that for certain rate-regulated subsidiaries the future recovery of pension and
other postretirement plans costs is probable in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 71.
These rate-regulated subsidiaries recorded regulatory assets and liabilities that would otherwise
have been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income. In addition, NiSource recorded a
reduction in deferred income taxes of approximately $96 million. NiSource will early adopt the
SFAS No. 158 measurement date provisions in the first quarter of 2007 requiring employers to
measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the fiscal year-end. Upon adopting the
measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158 in the first quarter of 2007, NiSource will decrease
its accrued liabilities for postretirement and postemployment benefits by approximately $89 million
and increase its deferred charges and other assets by approximately $9 million. In addition, 2007
expense for pension and postretirement benefits will reflect the updated measurement date
valuations.

SAB No. 108 — Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements
in Current Year Financial Statements.

In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108 to provide
guidance on how prior year misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in
current year financial statements. SAB No. 108 became effective for periods ending after November
15, 2006. There were no impacts to NiSource’s consolidated financial statements as a result of the
adoption of SAB No. 108.

SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) — Share-Based Payment.

Effective January 1, 2006, NiSource adopted
SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method. SFAS No. 123R requires measurement
of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation
over the service period for awards expected to vest. In accordance with the modified prospective
transition method, NiSource’s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been
restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS No. 123R. Prior to the adoption of
SFAS No. 123R, NiSource applied the intrinsic value method of APB No. 25 for awards granted under
its stock-based compensation plans and complied with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123.
There were no modifications to awards as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R.

When it adopted SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2006, NiSource recognized a cumulative effect
of change in accounting principle of $0.4 million, net of income taxes, which reflected the net
cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather
than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. Other than the requirement for
expensing stock options, outstanding share-based awards will continue to be accounted for
substantially as they are currently. As of December 31, 2006, the total remaining unrecognized
compensation cost related to non-vested awards amounted to $5.1 million, which will be amortized
over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of 2.6 years. The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and EPS as if NiSource had applied the fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation for 2005 and 2004.

SFAS No. 154 — Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 154 to provide guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error
corrections, which is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2005. SFAS No. 154 establishes, unless impracticable,
retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in
the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly
adopted accounting principle, and for the reporting of an error correction. Effective January 1, 2006, NiSource
adopted SFAS No. 154. There were no impacts to NiSource’s consolidated financial statements as a
result of the adoption of SFAS No. 154.

FIN 47 — Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations.

In March 2005, the FASB issued
FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and to provide
additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the
fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143. This interpretation is
effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource adopted FIN 47 in the fourth
quarter 2005. Refer to Note 6, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS No. 157 — Fair Value Measurements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 to define
fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and to expand disclosures about fair
value measurements. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of SFAS No. 157 to determine
the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and
should be applied prospectively, with limited exceptions.

FIN 48  —  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN
48 to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and
measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, this interpretation
requires that a tax position meet a “more-likely-than-not recognition threshold” for the benefit of
an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements and requires that benefit to
be measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon
ultimate settlement. When determining whether a tax position meets this 50% threshold, it is to be
based on whether it is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities,
based solely on the technical merits of the position. This interpretation is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2006. NiSource will adopt the provisions of FIN 48 in the first
quarter of 2007. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of this interpretation to
determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

3. Restructuring Activities

During the second quarter of 2005, NiSource Corporate Services reached a definitive agreement with
IBM under which IBM will provide a broad range of business transformation and outsourcing services
to NiSource. The service and outsourcing agreement is for ten years with a transition period that
ended on December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, 872 employees were terminated as a result of
the agreement with IBM, of whom 554 became employees of IBM. During the year 2006, 194 employees
were terminated, 10 of whom became employees of IBM. Adjustments to the restructuring liability
were recorded mainly for changes in estimated expenses related to the outsourcing initiative, and
are reflected in “Operation and maintenance” expense on the Statements of Consolidated Income.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, NiSource announced a plan to reduce its executive ranks by
approximately 15% to 20% of the top-level executive group. As of December 31, 2006, the employment
of 12 employees terminated as a result of the executive initiative, all of whom were terminated
during 2006. In part, this reduction has come through anticipated attrition and consolidation of
basic positions.

In previous years, NiSource implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and
realize efficiencies as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. In 2000, these restructuring
initiatives included a severance program, a voluntary early retirement program, and a transition
plan to implement operational efficiencies throughout the



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

company. In 2001, NiSource’s restructuring initiatives focused on creating operating efficiencies in the Gas Distribution and
the Electric Operations segments and included the closure of the Mitchell Station in Gary, Indiana.
During 2002, NiSource implemented a restructuring initiative which resulted in employee
terminations throughout the organization mainly affecting executive and other management-level
employees. As of December 31, 2006, 1,566 employees were terminated, of whom no employees were
terminated during the year ended December 31, 2006. In the third quarter of 2006, an adjustment was made to the restructuring reserve for leased
office space, reducing the reserve by $5.2 million as a result of the change in utilization of
office space. This adjustment is reflected in “Operation and maintenance” expense on the
Statements of Consolidated Income. Of the $3.8 million remaining restructuring liability from the
Columbia merger and related initiatives, $3.5 million is related to facility exit costs.

NDC Douglas Properties, a subsidiary of NiSource Development Company, is in the process of exiting
some of its low income housing investments. Two of these investments were disposed of during 2006
and three other investments are expected to be sold or disposed of during 2007. An impairment loss
of $2.3 million was recorded in the first half of 2006, due to the current book value exceeding the
estimated fair value of these investments. NiSource has accounted for the investments to be sold
as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations.

NiSource Corporate Services is in the process of selling its Marble Cliff facility. An impairment
loss of $2.5 million was recognized in the first quarter of 2006 due to the current book value
exceeding the estimated fair value of the facility. NiSource has accounted for this facility as
assets held for sale. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2006 NiSource Corporate Services sold
a corporate aircraft for its book value of $9.6 million. An impairment loss of $0.9 million was
recognized for the corporate aircraft that was accounted for as assets held for sale in the second
quarter of 2006.

NiSource Development Company is in the process of selling its Northern Indiana headquarters
facility. NiSource has accounted for this facility as assets held for sale.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of
$2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations
of the golf club as discontinued operations. In June 2006, the assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club,
valued at $11.9 million, and additional properties were sold to a private real estate development
group. An after-tax loss of $0.2 million was recorded in June 2006. As a result of the June 2006
transaction, property estimated to be sold to the private developer during the next twelve months
has been recorded as assets held for sale.

Columbia Transmission is in the process of selling certain facilities that are non-core to the
operation of the pipeline system. NiSource has accounted for the assets of these facilities as
assets held for sale. On October 16, 2006, Columbia Transmission sold assets for net book value of
$4.2 million, which were previously reported as assets held for sale. Based on discussion with the potential buyer, NiSource does not believe that it is
likely to sell certain assets formerly held by Transcom that were valued at $6.1 million. These
assets were written down to zero in June 2005.

The loss from discontinued operations in 2006 was primarily the result of an increase to legal
reserves and the sale of certain low-income housing investments. The loss from discontinued
operations in 2005 included changes to reserves for contingencies primarily related to CER and an
impairment of assets related to Transcom.

5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

NiSource’s goodwill assets at December 31, 2006 pertaining to the acquisition of Columbia on
November 1, 2000, were $3,658.5 million. The goodwill balances at December 31, 2006 for Northern
Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas were $13.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively.

In the quarter ended June 30, 2006, NiSource performed its annual impairment test of goodwill
associated with the purchases of Columbia, Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas. The
results of the June 30, 2006 impairment test indicated that no impairment charge was required. For
the purpose of testing for impairment the goodwill recorded in the acquisition of Columbia, the
related subsidiaries were aggregated into two distinct reporting units, one within the Gas
Distribution Operations segment and one within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment.
NiSource uses the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of its reporting units
for the purposes of this test.

The results of the June 30, 2005 impairment test indicated that no impairment charge was required
for the goodwill related to the purchase of Columbia or Northern Indiana Fuel and Light, and that
an impairment charge of $10.9 million was required for goodwill related to the purchase of Kokomo
Gas. This impairment charge was recorded in June 2005 and is reflected in operating expenses as an
“Impairment and (gain) loss on sale of assets” on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Factors
contributing to this charge were a reduction in the “regulatory earnings bank” and limitations on
future operating income growth.

NiSource’s
Intangible assets, apart from goodwill, consist of franchise rights,
which were identified as part of the purchase price allocations
associated with the acquisitions of Bay State, Northern Utilities,
which is a subsidiary of Bay State, and Granite. These
amounts were $435.7 million and $449.3 million, net of amortization
of $109.7 million and $96.1 million, at December 31,
2006, and 2005, respectively, and are being amortized over forty
years from the date of acquisition. NiSource had approximately
$46.5 million of other intangible assets recorded at
December 31, 2005 reflecting the additional minimum liability
associated with the unrecognized service cost of the pension plans
pursuant to SFAS No. 87.

6. Asset Retirement Obligations

NiSource has accounted for retirement obligations on its assets since January 1, 2003 with the
adoption of SFAS No. 143. In the fourth quarter 2005, NiSource adopted the provisions of FIN 47,
which broadened the scope of SFAS No. 143 to include contingent asset retirement obligations and it
also provided additional guidance for the measurement of the asset retirement liabilities. This
accounting standard and the related interpretation require entities to record the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the
liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized
cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate-regulated subsidiaries
defer the difference between the amount recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected in rates as required pursuant to SFAS No. 71
for those amounts it has collected in rates or expects to collect in future rates.

NiSource has recognized asset retirement obligations associated with various obligations
including costs to remove and dispose of certain construction materials located within many of
NiSource’s facilities, certain costs to retire pipeline, removal costs for certain underground
storage tanks, removal of certain pipelines known to contain PCB contamination, closure costs for
certain sites including ash ponds, solid waste management units and a landfill, obligation to
return leased rail cars to specified conditions and the removal costs of certain facilities and
off-shore platforms, as well as some other nominal asset retirement obligations. NiSource
recognizes that there are obligations to incur significant costs to retire wells associated with
gas storage operations, however, these assets are land assets with indeterminable lives.
Additionally, NiSource has a significant obligation associated with the decommissioning of its two
hydro facilities located in Indiana. However, these assets have an indeterminate life and no asset
retirement obligation has been recorded.

Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and
collected in the service rates of the rate-regulated subsidiaries are classified as regulatory
liabilities and other removal costs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, NiSource accrued $8.9 million of accretion, of which
$1.1 million was expensed and $7.8 million was recorded as a regulatory asset. For twelve months
ended December 31, 2005, NiSource accrued $0.5 million of accretion, of which $0.3 million was
expensed and $0.2 million was recorded as a regulatory asset.

7. Regulatory Matters

Gas Distribution Operations Related Matters

Significant Rate Developments.

On February 1, 2007, Columbia of Kentucky filed a base rate case
requesting an increase in rates of $12.6 million, or approximately 8%. Included in the filing is a
request for approval of an accelerated main replacement cost recovery mechanism, in order to
facilitate replacement of certain parts of Columbia of Kentucky’s natural gas distribution system.
Also, included are proposals to help offset the effects of recent usage declines and increased
customer attrition. Hearings are expected to be held in the second quarter of 2007, with new rates
expected to be in effect by the third quarter.

On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a PBR
plan, which would freeze non-gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning
January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR
plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (“Investigation”) into the justness and
reasonableness of Columbia of Virginia’s current rates, charges and terms and conditions of
service

.

On December 12, 2006, Columbia of Virginia, VSCC Staff and all parties to the proceedings
presented a comprehensive settlement resolving all issues in the proceedings. The Hearing Examiner
recommended approval of the settlement in a report issued December 21, 2006 and the VSCC approved the
settlement by Order issued December 28, 2006. Among other things, the settlement, which became
effective January 1, 2007, establishes a PBR for a four-year period, freezing Columbia of
Virginia’s non-gas rates at their current levels and setting up an earnings sharing mechanism and
temporary rate credits during the PBR plan period, and contains a commitment by Columbia of
Virginia to expand its system to continue to meet growth needs.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement
Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the
Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The
new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indiana’s Choice program for
customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings
of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the
settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain
defined issues during the term of this agreement.

In mid 2006, Northern Indiana filed a petition which simplifies gas distribution rates, stabilizes
revenues and provides for energy efficiency funding. Northern Indiana filed its detailed case in
this proceeding in January 2007, based upon lengthy and detailed discussion with stakeholders. All
parties requested and the IURC has granted an expedited schedule in this proceeding. Northern
Indiana expects a final order in the cause in the second quarter of 2007.

Cost Recovery and Trackers.

A significant portion of the distribution companies’ revenue is
related to the recovery of gas costs, the review and recovery of which occurs via standard
regulatory proceedings. All states require periodic review of actual gas procurement activity to
determine prudence and to permit the recovery of prudently incurred costs related to the supply of
gas for customers. NiSource distribution companies have historically been found prudent in the
procurement of gas supplies to serve customers.

Certain operating costs of the NiSource distribution companies are significant, recurring in
nature, and generally outside the control of the distribution companies. Some states allow the
recovery of such costs via cost tracking mechanisms. Such tracking mechanisms allow for
abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the distribution companies to implement charges and
recover appropriate costs. Tracking mechanisms allow for more timely recovery of such costs as
compared with more traditional cost recovery mechanisms. Examples of such mechanisms include gas
cost recovery adjustment mechanisms, tax riders, and bad debt recovery mechanisms. Gas
Distribution Operations revenue is increased by the implementation and recovery of costs via such
tracking mechanisms.

Comparability of Gas Distribution Operations line item operating results is impacted by these
regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt
expenses. Increases in the expenses that are the subject of trackers result in a corresponding
increase in net revenues and therefore have essentially no impact on total operating income
results. Operating expenses increased by $50.5 million for expenses which are subject to such
trackers and are therefore primarily offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting
recovery of certain costs.

Certain types of natural gas risers, which are owned by customers, on Columbia of Ohio’s
distribution system have been evaluated under a study required by the PUCO, and have been found to
be prone to leak natural gas under certain conditions. On February 1, 2007, Columbia of Ohio
announced plans to identify and replace these certain types of risers on its distribution system.
Columbia of Ohio estimates that the cost to identify and replace the risers will approximate $200
million, and will be seeking approval to implement an infrastructure replacement program cost
recovery mechanism.

Customer Usage.

The NiSource distribution companies continue to experience declining usage by
customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to historically high commodity prices. A
significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at
the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon
throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Many of NiSource’s LDCs are evaluating mechanisms that
would “de-couple” the recovery of fixed costs from throughput, and implement recovery mechanisms
that more closely link the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. Each of the states that the
NiSource LDCs operate in has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such
changes.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations Regulatory Matters

Significant FERC Developments.

On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the “Order on Accounting for
Pipeline Assessment Costs.” This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application
across the industry for accounting of the DOT’s Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of
the guidance was January 1, 2006 after



ITEM 8.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

which all assessment costs have been recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to
January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. In November, 2005, the INGAA sought
review of the matter before the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (INGAA V. FERC, No.
05-1426). Oral Argument was presented before the Court on January 16, 2007 and a ruling is
currently pending.

On July 20, 2006, the FERC issued a declaratory order in response to a petition filed by Tennessee
Gas Pipeline. The petition related to a Tennessee Gas Pipeline request to establish an
interconnection with the Columbia Gulf operated portion of the Blue Water Pipeline system.
Columbia Gulf has a long-standing practice of providing interconnections with other interstate
pipelines only as long as there is an interconnection agreement in place that governs the rules of
the interconnection. Among other things, these agreements help protect the integrity of Columbia
Gulf’s system and the reliability of service to its customers. The FERC ruled that Tennessee Gas
Pipeline’s interconnection request should be governed by the existing Blue Water Pipeline Operating
Agreement between Columbia Gulf and Tennessee Gas Pipeline. Columbia Gulf constructed the
necessary taps and Tennessee Gas Pipeline then completed its portion of the interconnection
facilities. The interconnection was ready to flow gas on October 1, 2006. On December 29, 2006,
Columbia Gulf filed in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals a Petition for Review of the Commission’s
July 20, 2006 order and a subsequent order denying Columbia Gulf’s Request for Rehearing.

In the declaratory order, the FERC also referred the matter to the Office of Enforcement to
determine if there should be any action taken against Columbia Gulf for failing to comply with
prior orders that directed Columbia Gulf to allow Tennessee Gas Pipeline to make an
interconnection. While disappointed with the FERC’s referral of this matter to the Office of
Enforcement, Columbia Gulf has cooperated with the Office of Enforcement’s investigation. Columbia
Gulf expects the staff will complete its investigation in the near future, but is unable to predict
the outcome at this time.

Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project.

Millennium received FERC approval for a pipeline project, in
which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as operator, which will provide access
to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The reconfigured
project, which was approved by the FERC in a certificate order issued December 21, 2006, will begin
at an interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and
extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to
connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium will extend eastward to an interconnect
with Algonquin Gas Transmission Co. at Ramapo, New York.

The certificate order approved the project costs related to the construction and development of the
Millennium project as described above. The order also approved the vacating of portions of the
original September 2002 Millennium certificate that related to other facilities.

The Millennium owners no longer believe the recovery of the capitalized costs related to the
vacated portions of the project is probable. Therefore, Millennium has fully reserved the
capitalized costs related to the development of the vacated portions. NiSource’s Gas Transmission
and Storage Operations segment recorded a $13 million charge reflecting its share of Millennium’s
reserve during the fourth quarter of 2006.

Hardy Storage Project.

Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary
applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received favorable orders on
November 1, 2005. On October 26, 2006, Hardy Storage filed an application seeking to amend the
November 1, 2005 order to revise the initial rates and estimated costs for the project pursuant to
executed settlement agreements with Hardy Storage’s customers. The amendment application is uncontested and Hardy Storage has requested expedited FERC action on the
filing by February 28, 2007.

Electric Operations Regulatory Matters

Significant Rate Developments.

To settle a proceeding regarding Northern Indiana’s request to
recover intermediate dispatchable power costs, Northern Indiana has agreed to file an electric base
rate case on or before July 1, 2008.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate
review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement.
The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will
receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225
million, for the minimum 49-month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The credits will continue
beyond the minimum period at the same annual level and per the same methodology, until the IURC
enters a basic rate order that approves revised Northern Indiana’s electric rates subsequent to the
minimum period. The order included a rate moratorium that expired on July 31, 2006. The order
also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by
Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times
of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $50.9
million and $58.5 million were recognized for electric customers for the years ended December 31,
2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively.

MISO.

As part of Northern Indiana’s participation in the MISO transmission service and wholesale
energy market, certain administrative fees and non-fuel costs have been incurred. IURC Orders have
been issued authorizing the deferral for consideration in a future rate case proceeding the
administrative fees and non-fuel related costs incurred after Northern Indiana’s rate moratorium,
which expired on July 31, 2006. During 2006 the administrative fees totaled $5.5 million. Of this
amount, $3.0 million was expensed and $2.5 million was deferred. Non-fuel costs were $12.8 million
in 2006, of which $11.5 million was expensed and $1.3 million was deferred. On May 4, 2006, the
IURC issued a final order authorizing the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as
fuel-related and therefore recoverable through the FAC mechanism. As a result of this order
Northern Indiana realized an increase in net revenues of $7.9 million.

On April 25, 2006, the FERC issued an order on the MISO’s Transmission and Energy Markets Tariff,
stating that MISO had violated the tariff on several issues including not assessing revenue
sufficiency guarantee charges on virtual bids and offers and for charging revenue sufficiency
guarantee charges on imports. The FERC ordered MISO to perform a resettlement of these charges
back to April 1, 2005. Although the amount of resettlements applicable to Northern Indiana cannot
be quantified at this time, it is not expected to be material.

Cost Recovery and Trackers.

A significant portion of the Northern Indiana’s revenue is related to
the recovery of fuel costs to generate power and the fuel costs related to purchased power. These
costs are recovered through a standard, quarterly, “summary” regulatory proceeding in Indiana
(FAC). Northern Indiana has historically been found prudent in the procurement of fuel and
purchased power.

In July 2006, the IURC issued an order creating a sub-docket in FAC 71 based upon a motion by
interveners, the Industrial Group and La Porte County. The motion requested an investigation into
Northern Indiana’s generation and purchases practices that could not be fully considered in a
summary proceeding. The sub-docket will also address concerns raised by the OUCC related to the
reasonableness of recovering financial hedging transactions within the FAC. Subsequently, the IURC
has approved FAC 72 and FAC 73 subject to the sub-docket in FAC 71. Amounts collected pursuant to
FAC 71, 72 and 73 are subject to refund based upon the final order in the sub-docket.

On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern
Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by
Northern Indiana to implement IDEM’s NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related
operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become
operational through an EERM. Under the IURC’s November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is
permitted to submit filings on a semi-annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the
EERM. On December 13, 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indiana’s latest compliance plan with the
estimate of $312.8 million. On March 29, 2006 the IURC approved EER-3 for operating expenses of
$18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On September 28, 2006 the IURC approved ECR-8 for capital
expenditure (net of accumulated depreciation) of $226.8 million. Northern Indiana filed ECR-9 and
EER-4 on February 7, 2007 for net capital expenditures of $222.2 million and $14.1 million in
operating expenses.

On December 8, 2006, Northern Indiana filed a petition requesting a certificate of public
convenience and necessity for clean coal technology projects, to address the first phase of CAIR
and CAMR. The request included initiating ongoing review of the construction of the projects; finding that the projects
constitute “qualified pollution control property” and are eligible for the rate-making treatment;
finding that the projects constitute “clean coal and energy projects” and finding that the projects are

reasonable and necessary and therefore eligible for the financial incentives; approving
accounting, rate-making treatment, cost recovery and other relief in connection with Northern
Indiana’s clean coal technology, qualified pollution control property and clean coal and energy
projects. Testimony was filed in February 2007 requesting approval of $23 million of cost estimates for the projects.

Mitchell Station.

In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station.
In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the
Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length
of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana, with input from a broad based
stakeholder group, is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell Station facility
in light of Northwest Indiana’s need for that property and the substantial costs associated with
restarting the facility including the potential increase in level of environmental controls
required.

8. Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities

NiSource uses commodity-based derivative financial instruments primarily to manage commodity price
risk and interest rate risk exposure in its business as well as for commercial and industrial
sales. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. NiSource accounts for its
derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133. Under SFAS No. 133, if certain conditions are met, a
derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair
value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the
exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction.

The hedging activity for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 affecting accumulated

During 2006 and 2005, gains of $0.1 million and $0.4 million, net of taxes respectively, were
recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as
hedges. All derivatives classified as a hedge are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any
components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as a regulatory asset or
liability per SFAS No. 71 as appropriate. During year 2006 and 2005, NiSource reclassified no
amounts related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings, due to the
probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur. It is anticipated that during
the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in
income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income of
approximately $54.6 million, net of taxes.

Commodity Price Risk Programs.

Northern Indiana, Northern Indiana Fuel and Light, Kokomo Gas,
Northern Utilities, Columbia of Pennsylvania, Columbia of Kentucky, Columbia of Maryland and
Columbia of Virginia use NYMEX derivative contracts to minimize risk associated with gas price
volatility. These derivative hedging programs must be marked to fair value, but because these
derivatives are used within the framework of their gas cost recovery mechanism, regulatory assets
or liabilities are recorded to offset the change in the fair value of these derivatives.

Northern Indiana offers a PPS as an alternative to the standard gas cost recovery mechanism. This
service provides Northern Indiana customers with the opportunity to either lock in their gas cost
or place a cap on the total cost that could be charged for any future month specified. In order to
hedge the anticipated physical future purchases associated with these obligations, Northern Indiana
purchases NYMEX futures and options contracts that correspond to a fixed or capped price in the
associated delivery month. The NYMEX futures and options contracts are designated as cash flow
hedges. Columbia of Virginia started a program in April 2005 similar to the Northern Indiana PPS,
which allows non-jurisdictional customers the opportunity to lock in their gas cost. These
derivative programs are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Northern Indiana also offers a DependaBill program to its customers as an alternative to the
standard tariff rate that is charged to residential customers. The program allows Northern Indiana
customers to fix their total monthly bill at a flat rate regardless of gas usage or commodity cost.
In order to hedge the anticipated physical purchases associated with these obligations, Northern
Indiana purchases NYMEX futures and options contracts that match the anticipated delivery needs of
the program. This derivative program is accounted for as a cash flow hedge.

As part of the new MISO Day 2 initiative, Northern Indiana was allocated and has purchased FTRs.
These rights protect Northern Indiana against congestion costs due to the new MISO Day 2 activity.
The FTRs do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, but since congestion costs are recoverable
through the fuel cost recovery mechanism the related gains and losses associated with these
transactions are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability, in accordance with SFAS No. 71.
Additionally, Northern Indiana also uses derivative contracts to minimize risk associated with
power price volatility. These derivative programs must be marked to fair value, but because these
derivatives are used within the framework of their cost recovery mechanism, regulatory assets or
liabilities are recorded to offset the change in the fair value of there derivatives.

For regulatory incentive purposes, Northern Indiana enters into purchase contracts at first of the
month prices that give counterparties the daily option to either sell an additional package of gas
at first of the month prices or recall the original volume to be delivered. Northern Indiana
charges a fee for this option. The changes in the fair value of these options are primarily due to
the changing expectations of the future intra-month volatility of gas prices. These written
options are derivative instruments, must be marked to fair value and do not meet the requirement
for hedge accounting treatment. However, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, Northern Indiana records
the related gains and losses associated with these transactions as a regulatory asset or liability.

For regulatory incentive purposes, Columbia of Kentucky, Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of
Pennsylvania, Columbia of Virginia and Columbia of Maryland (collectively, the “Columbia LDCs”)
have the opportunity to enter into contracts that allow counterparties the option to sell gas to
Columbia LDCs at first of the month prices for a particular month of delivery. Columbia LDCs
charge the counterparties a fee for this option. The changes in the fair value of the options are
primarily due to the changing expectations of the future intra-month volatility of gas prices.
Columbia LDCs defer a portion of the change in the fair value of the options as either a regulatory
asset or liability in accordance with SFAS No. 71. The remaining change is recognized currently in
earnings.

Columbia Energy Services has fixed price gas delivery commitments to three municipalities in the
United States. Columbia Energy Services entered into a forward purchase agreement with a gas
supplier, wherein the supplier will fulfill the delivery obligation requirements at a slight
premium to index. In order to hedge this anticipated future purchase of gas from the gas supplier,
Columbia Energy Services entered into commodity swaps priced at the locations designated for
physical delivery. These commodity swap derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Interest Rate Risk Activities.

Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45%
notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest
rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of
$35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the
underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88%, respectively.

NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics
of its outstanding long-term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance
entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million
with six counterparties having a 6 1/2-year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based
upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6-month BBA
LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of
the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009.

On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in
a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11-year term. NiSource Finance
will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount
based on U.S. 6-month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of
premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the
swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

As a result of the fixed-to-variable interest rate swap transactions referenced above, $1,160
million of NiSource Finance’s existing long-term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest
rates. These interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges. The effectiveness of the
interest rate swaps in offsetting the exposure to changes in the debt’s fair value is measured
using the short-cut method pursuant to SFAS No. 133. NiSource had no net gain or loss recognized
in earnings due to hedging ineffectiveness from prior years.

9. Variable Interest Entities and Equity Investments

A. Variable Interest Entities.

On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R which required a
variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority
of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity’s activities or is entitled to receive a
majority of the entity’s residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity
is the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a
corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that
either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do
not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also
requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to
consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2004, NiSource has consolidated certain low income housing real
estate investments per FIN 46R, from which NiSource derives certain tax benefits for its
investment. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, NiSource increased its long-term debt by approximately $13.5 million and $35.8 million,
respectively, as a result of consolidating these investments. However, this debt is nonrecourse to
NiSource and NiSource’s direct and indirect subsidiaries.

B. Equity Investments.

Certain investments of NiSource are accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. Income and losses from Millennium and Hardy Storage are reflected in Equity Earnings
(Loss) in Unconsolidated Affiliates on NiSource’s Statements of Consolidated Income. These
investments are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Income and
losses from all other equity investments are reflected in Other, net (below Operating Income) on
NiSource’s Statements of Consolidated Income. All investments shown as limited partnerships are
limited partnership interests.

The effective income tax rates were 35.3%, 34.5%, and 35.9% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The overall effective tax rate increase in 2006 versus 2005 was due to favorable state and federal
income tax adjustments recorded in 2005 (discussed below) and a reduction in the electric
production deduction and low income housing credits from those recorded in 2005. The increase was
partially offset by a lower effective state income tax rate in 2006 due to a reduction in deferred
state income tax liabilities.

The 1.4% decrease in the effective tax rate from 2004 to 2005 is due to the impact of the tax
benefit associated with the electric production deduction (discussed below), an adjustment to
deferred taxes at Northern Indiana related to a reduction in deferred income tax requirements and a
reduction in deferred state income tax liabilities resulting from a revised estimate of
consolidated state income tax apportionment factors. Offsetting these reductions is an increase in
the effective tax rate associated with the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge recorded at
Kokomo Gas and increased taxes related to Ohio income tax law changes enacted on June 30, 2005.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, signed into law on October 22, 2004, created new Internal
Revenue Code Section 199 which, beginning in 2005, permits taxpayers to claim a deduction from
taxable income attributable to certain domestic production activities. Northern Indiana and
Whiting Clean Energy’s electric production activities qualify for this deduction. The deduction is
equal to 3% of QPAI for the taxable year, with certain limitations. This deduction increases to 6%
of QPAI beginning in 2007 and 9% of QPAI beginning in 2010 and thereafter. The tax benefit for the Section
199 domestic production activities deduction claimed in NiSource’s 2005 consolidated federal income tax
return was $0.9 million and is estimated to be $0.9 million for 2006.

Included under Other, net in the table above, are state income tax net operating loss benefits of
$14.2 million and $15.8 million, as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. This tax loss
carryforward expires after tax year 2009. NiSource anticipates it will ultimately realize $3.8
million and $5.2 million of these benefits as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005,
respectively, prior to their expiration. As such, a valuation allowance of $10.4 million and $10.6
million, as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, has been recorded.

11. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

NiSource provides defined contribution plans and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans
that cover its employees. Benefits under the defined benefit retirement plans reflect the
employees’ compensation, years of service and age at retirement. Additionally, NiSource provides
health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. The majority of employees
may become eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement age while working for NiSource.
The expected cost of such benefits is accrued during the employees’ years of service. Current
rates of rate-regulated companies include postretirement benefit costs, including amortization of
the regulatory assets that arose prior to inclusion of these costs in rates. For most plans, cash
contributions are remitted to grantor trusts. As of December 31, 2006, NiSource used September 30
as its measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans.

In the fourth quarter of 2006, NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158 requiring employers
to recognize in the statement of financial position the overfunded or underfunded status of a
defined benefit postretirement plan, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan
assets and the benefit obligation. Based on the measurement of the various defined benefit pension
and other postretirement plans’ assets and benefit obligations at September 30, 2006, the pretax
impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 decreased intangible assets by $46.5 million, decreased deferred
charges and other assets by $1.1 million, increased regulatory assets by $538.8 million, increased
accumulated other comprehensive income by $239.8 million and increased accrued liabilities for
postretirement and postemployment benefits by $251.4 million. With the adoption of SFAS No. 158 NiSource determined
that for certain rate-regulated subsidiaries the future recovery of pension and other
postretirement plans costs is probable in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 71. These
rate-regulated subsidiaries recorded regulatory assets and liabilities that would otherwise have
been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income. In addition, NiSource recorded a
reduction in deferred income taxes of approximately $96 million. NiSource will early adopt the
SFAS No. 158 measurement date provisions in the first quarter of 2007 requiring employers to
measure plan



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

assets and benefit obligations as of the fiscal year-end. Upon adopting the
measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158 in the first quarter of 2007, NiSource will decrease
its accrued liabilities for postretirement and postemployment benefits by approximately $89 million
and increase its deferred charges and other assets by approximately $9 million. In addition, 2007
expense for pension and postretirement benefits will reflect the updated measurement date
valuations.

NiSource employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income
investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded
status, and asset class volatility. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of
equity and fixed income investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S.
and non-U.S. stocks, as well as growth, value, small and large capitalizations. Other assets such
as private equity and hedge funds are used judiciously to enhance long-term returns while improving
portfolio diversification. Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and
timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market
value of the underlying assets. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis
through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic
asset/liability studies.

The most important component of an investment strategy is the portfolio asset mix, or the
allocation between the various classes of securities available to the pension plan for investment
purposes. The asset mix and acceptable minimum and maximum ranges established represents a
long-term view and are as follows:

NiSource employs a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and
rebalancing in determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are
studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are analyzed to
ensure that they are consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate greater return over
the long run. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before
long-term capital market assumptions are determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed
to check for reasonability and appropriateness.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

NiSource pension fund assets earned a return of 9.6% for the plan year ended September 30, 2006 and
14.7% for the plan year ended September 30, 2005. Also, the discount rate used to measure
NiSource’s benefit obligation increased slightly to 5.85% from 5.5% the previous year. In
accordance with SFAS No. 87, NiSource adjusted its minimum pension liability at September 30, 2006,
decreasing its accrued liabilities for postretirement and postemployment benefits by approximately
$15 million and decreasing its intangible assets by approximately $8 million, due in part to the
growth in plan assets. However, due to the adoption of SFAS 158, NiSource increased its accrued
liabilities for postretirement and postemployment benefits by $251.4 million in the fourth quarter
of 2006. This increase in liability was due to the requirement to recognize the overfunded or
underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in its statement of financial position.

During the third quarter of 2005 NiSource recognized a $16.2 million curtailment for pension and
other postretirement benefits and a $2.2 million cost for special termination benefits in
connection with business processes outsourced under the IBM agreement. Of this amount,
approximately $0.4 million was recorded as a regulatory asset per SFAS No. 71 and $18.0 million was
charged to restructuring expense.

Based on a September 30 measurement date, the net unrecognized actuarial loss, unrecognized
prior service cost, and unrecognized transition obligation for the pension and other postretirement
benefit plans that will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost during 2007 are $19.3 million,
$6.1 million and $8.1 million, respectively. No amounts of NiSource’s pension or other
postretirement plans’ assets are expected to be returned to NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in
2007.

12. Authorized Classes of Cumulative Preferred and Preference Stocks

NiSource has 20,000,000 authorized shares of Preferred with a $0.01 par value, of which 4,000,000
shares are designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares.

On April 14, 2006, Northern Indiana redeemed all of its outstanding cumulative preferred stock,
having a total redemption value of $81.6 million.

The authorized classes of par value and no par value cumulative preferred and preference stocks of
Northern Indiana are as follows: 2,400,000 shares of Cumulative Preferred with a $100 par value;
3,000,000 shares of Cumulative Preferred with no par value; 2,000,000 shares of Cumulative
Preference with a $50 par value; and 3,000,000 shares of Cumulative Preference with no par value.

13. Common Stock

As of December 31, 2006, NiSource had 400,000,000 authorized shares of common stock with a $0.01
par value.

A. Shareholder Rights Plan.

NiSource had a Shareholder Rights Plan, pursuant to which one right
accompanies each share of common stock. Each right, when exercisable, would initially entitle the
holder to purchase from NiSource one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, with $0.01 par value, at a price of $60 per one one-hundredth of a share. In certain circumstances, if an
acquirer obtained 25% of NiSource’s outstanding shares, or merged into NiSource or merged NiSource
into the acquirer, the rights would entitle the holders to purchase NiSource’s or the acquirer’s
common shares for one-half of the market price.

On November 28, 2006, the NiSource Board adopted and approved the First Amendment to the
Shareholder Rights Plan, dated November 1, 2000, which requires that a holder of a Right
Certificate must exercise their rights by November 29, 2006. As a result of this amendment, no
rights are eligible to be exercised after November 29, 2006.

B. Common Stock Dividend.

Holders of shares of NiSource’s common stock are entitled to receive
dividends when, and if declared by the Board out of funds legally available. The policy of the
Board has been to declare cash dividends on a quarterly basis payable on or about the 20th day of
February, May, August and November. NiSource has paid quarterly common dividends totaling $0.92
per share for the 2006, 2005 and 2004 years. At its January 5, 2007 meeting, the Board declared a
quarterly common dividend of $0.23 per share, payable on February 20, 2007 to holders of record on
January 31, 2007.

14. Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, NiSource adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition
method. SFAS No. 123R requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair
value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards
expected to vest. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, NiSource’s
Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not
include, the impact of SFAS No. 123R. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, NiSource applied the
intrinsic value method of APB No. 25 for awards granted under its stock-based compensation plans
and complied with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123.

NiSource currently issues long-term incentive grants to key management employees under a long-term
incentive plan approved by stockholders on April 13, 1994 (1994 Plan). The 1994 Plan, as amended
and restated, permits the following types of grants, separately or in combination: nonqualified
stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights,
performance units, contingent stock awards and dividend equivalents payable on grants of options,
performance units and contingent stock awards. Under the plan, each option has a maximum term of
ten years from the date of grant. NiSource has traditionally awarded stock options to employees at
the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant. For stock options granted
during January 2005, NiSource awarded stock options that vested immediately, but included a
one-year exercise restriction. Stock appreciation rights may be granted only in tandem with stock
options on a one-for-one basis and are payable in cash, common stock, or a combination thereof.

At the annual meeting of stockholders held on May 10, 2005, NiSource’s stockholders approved
proposed amendments to the 1994 Plan. The amendments (i) increased the maximum number of shares of
NiSource common stock that may be subject to awards from 21 million to 43 million and (ii) extended
the period during which awards could be granted to May 10, 2015 and extended the term of the plan
until all the awards have been satisfied by either issuance of stock or the payment of cash. At
December 31, 2006, there were 26,205,407 shares reserved for future awards under the amended and
restated 1994 Plan.

NiSource has granted restricted stock awards, which are restricted as to transfer and are subject
to forfeiture for specific periods from the date of grant and will vest over periods from one year
or more. If a participant’s employment is terminated prior to vesting other than by reason of
death, disability or retirement, restricted shares are forfeited. However, awards may vest upon
death, disability, or upon a change of control or retirement. There were 10,000 restricted shares
outstanding at December 31, 2006, which were not a part of the time accelerated restricted stock
award plan described below.

NiSource awarded restricted shares and restricted stock units that contain provisions for
time-accelerated vesting to key executives under the 1994 Plan. Most of these awards were issued
in January 2003 and January 2004. These awards of restricted stock or restricted stock units
generally vest over a period of six years or, in the case of restricted stock units at age 62 if an
employee would become age 62 within six years, but not less than three years. If certain
predetermined criteria involving measures of total shareholder return are met, as measured at the
end of the third year after the grant date, the awards vest at the end of the third year. At
December 31, 2006, NiSource had 813,726 awards outstanding which contain the time-accelerated
provisions. The total shareholder return measures established for the 2003 and 2004 awards were
not met, therefore these grants did not have an accelerated vesting period.

During 2006, NiSource did not provide incumbent executives additional grants of options, restricted
or contingent shares. For 2007, the NiSource Board approved a grant of performance-based
contingent shares, which are expected to be granted in March 2007.

The Amended and Restated Non-employee Director Stock Incentive Plan, which was approved by the
Board and stockholders at the 2003 annual meeting, provides for the issuance of up to 500,000
shares of common stock to non-employee directors. The Plan provides for awards of restricted
stock, stock options and restricted stock units, which vest in 20% increments per year, with full
vesting after five years. Awards under the Plan are subject to immediate vesting in the event of
the director’s death or disability, retirement at or after age 70, or a change in control of
NiSource. If a director’s service on the Board is terminated for any reason other than retirement
at or after age 70, death or disability, any awards of restricted stock, stock options or
restricted stock units are forfeited. No stock options have been granted under the Non-employee Director Stock Incentive Plan. As of December 31,
2006, 89,860 restricted shares and 109,194 restricted stock units had been issued under the Plan.

15. Long-Term Debt

NiSource Finance is a wholly-owned, consolidated finance subsidiary of NiSource that engages in
financing activities to raise funds for the business operations of NiSource and its subsidiaries.
NiSource Finance was incorporated in February 2000 under the laws of the state of Indiana.
NiSource Finance’s obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NiSource.

During 2006, NiSource funded the redemption of $434.4 million of long-term debt with cash from
operations and an increase of short term borrowings. NiSource decided not to issue new long-term
debt until the strategic and financial review is completed. The review is expected to be completed
in early 2007.

During November 2006, NiSource redeemed $144.4 million of its senior debentures with an interest
rate of 3.628%. Also during November 2006, NiSource Finance redeemed $250.0 million of its
unsecured notes with an interest rate of 3.20%.

During May 2006, NiSource redeemed $25.0 million of Capital Markets medium-term notes, with an
average interest rate of 7.50%.

During April 2006, NiSource redeemed $15.0 million of Capital Markets medium-term notes, with an
average interest rate of 7.75%.

On November 29, 2005, Columbia redeemed $1.1 billion of its senior unsecured notes that became
callable on November 28, 2005 having an average interest rate of 7.34%. On November 28, 2005,
Columbia redeemed $281.5 million of its senior unsecured notes with an average interest rate of
6.80%. The associated charges included an $86 million non-cash charge relating to the write-off of
the unamortized portion of a fair market value adjustment made at the time of the NiSource Columbia
merger, an $8 million non-cash charge associated with the unamortized
portion of swap termination charges, and a $14 million cash charge for call premiums, all of which
were charged to loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt.

On November 28, 2005, NiSource Finance issued, in the private placement market, $900 million in
unregistered senior unsecured notes in four tranches: $315 million of 7-year notes at a coupon rate
of 5.21%; $230 million of 10-year notes at a coupon rate of 5.36%; $90 million of 11-year notes at
a coupon rate of 5.41%; and $265 million of 20-year notes at a coupon rate of 5.89%. The proceeds,
along with other funding sources, were used to refinance the above mentioned Columbia senior
unsecured notes.

On November 15, 2005, NiSource Finance redeemed $900 million of its senior unsecured notes having
an average interest rate of 7.625%.

On September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of 5.25% 12-year unsecured notes that
mature September 15, 2017 and $550 million of 5.45% 15-year unsecured notes that mature September
15, 2020. The proceeds were used in part to redeem $900 million of NiSource Finance notes due
November 15, 2005. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes, NiSource
Finance terminated $900 million of forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to
NiSource’s swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of
the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively.

During July 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $34.0 million of its medium-term notes with an average
interest rate of 6.62%.

During June 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $39.3 million of its medium-term notes and Bay State
redeemed $10.0 million of its medium-term notes with an average interest rate of 6.79% and 6.58%,
respectively.

Following are the outstanding long-term debt sinking fund requirements and maturities at December
31, 2006. The long-term debt maturities shown below include capital lease obligations but exclude
unamortized premium and discount on long-term debt, and exclude the debt of certain low-income
housing real estate investments, as NiSource does not guarantee the long-term debt payment of these
entities. Under the provisions of FIN No. 46R, the low-income housing real estate investments were
required to be consolidated beginning in the first quarter of 2004.

Unamortized debt expense, premium and discount on long-term debt applicable to outstanding
bonds are being amortized over the lives of such bonds. Reacquisition premiums have been deferred
and are being amortized. These premiums are not earning a return during the recovery period.

Of NiSource’s long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2006 $196.0 million was issued by
NiSource’s affiliate, Capital Markets. The financial obligations of Capital Markets are subject to
a Support Agreement between NiSource and Capital Markets, under which NiSource has committed to
make payments of interest and principal on Capital Market’s obligations in the event of a failure
to pay by Capital Markets. Under the terms of the Support Agreement, in addition to the cash flow
of cash dividends paid to NiSource by any of its consolidated subsidiaries, the assets of NiSource,
other than the stock and assets of Northern Indiana, are available as recourse for the benefit
of Capital Market’s creditors. The carrying value of the assets of NiSource, other than the assets
of Northern Indiana, was $13.5 billion at December 31, 2006.

NiSource Finance has entered into interest rate swap agreements for $1,160 million of its
outstanding long-term debt. The effect of these agreements is to modify the interest rate
characteristics of a portion of their respective long-term debt from fixed to variable. Refer to
Note 8, “Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information regarding interest rate swaps.

NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under both its five-year revolving credit facility
and its new three-month revolving credit agreement. NiSource must maintain a debt to
capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of December 31, 2006, NiSource was in compliance
with this financial covenant under both agreements.

NiSource is also subject to certain other covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such
covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSource’s assets,
generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting
security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSource’s consolidated net
tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and/or transfer of
NiSource’s assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit
facilities also include a cross-default provision, which triggers an event of default under the
credit facility in the event of any uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of
NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more.

NiSource’s bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However,
NiSource’s bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured
payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on
NiSource’s assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests,
preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of
NiSource’s consolidated net tangible assets.

16. Short-Term Borrowings

During July 2006, NiSource Finance amended its $1.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility
increasing the aggregate commitment level to $1.5 billion, extending the termination date by one
year to July 2011, and reduced the cost of borrowing. The amended facility will help
maintain a reasonable cushion of short-term liquidity in anticipation of continuing volatile
natural gas prices. During November 2006, NiSource Finance entered into a new $300 million
three-month revolving credit agreement with Dresdner Kleinwort that expired February 15, 2007.

As of December 31, 2006, NiSource had $24.6 million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding under
its five-year revolving credit facility. NiSource Finance maintains a five-year revolving line of
credit with a syndicate of financial institutions which can be used either for borrowings or the
issuance of letters of credit.

Short-term borrowings were as follows:

The increase in short term borrowings was primarily due to the redemption of long term debt

review is completed. The review is expected to be completed in early 2007.

17. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of
financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value:

Investments.

Where feasible, the fair value of investments is estimated based on market prices for
those or similar investments.

Long-term Debt and Preferred Stock.

The fair values of these securities are estimated based on the
quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the rates offered for securities of the
same remaining maturities. Certain premium costs associated with the early settlement of long-term
debt are not taken into consideration in determining fair value.

to CORC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement,
also dated May 14, 2004, under the terms of which it sells an undivided percentage ownership
interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The agreement, which had a
scheduled expiration date of May 12, 2006, was extended for another year to May 11, 2007. The
agreement was further amended on July 1, 2006 increasing the program limit from $300 million to
$350 million and extending the expiration date to June 29, 2007. As of December 31, 2006, $184.3
million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping
and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives
a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services.

On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of
its trade receivables, as they originate, to NRC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana.
NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement under the term of which it sells an undivided percentage
ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can
purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. NRC’s agreement with the
commercial paper conduit has a scheduled expiration date of December 21, 2007, and can be renewed
if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2006, NRC had sold $189.7 million of
accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if
Northern Indiana’s debt rating falls below BBB- or Baa3 at Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s,
respectively.

Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and
cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which
provides adequate compensation, for such services.

NiSource’s accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting based upon the conditions met
in SFAS No. 140. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor
and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. The
transferors do not retain any interest in the receivables under both agreements.

18. Other Commitments and Contingencies

A. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities.

NiSource expects that approximately $801.1
million will be expended for construction and other investment purposes during 2007.

B. Assets Under Lien.

Substantially all of Columbia Transmission properties have been pledged to
Columbia as security for debt owed by Columbia Transmission to Columbia. All of the debt that was
secured by this lien has been paid and NiSource is in the process of having this lien released.

C. Guarantees and Indemnities.

As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries
enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on
behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit.
These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise
attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient
credit to accomplish the subsidiaries’ intended commercial purposes. The total guarantees and
indemnities in existence at December 31, 2006 and the years in which they expire were:

Guarantees of Subsidiaries Debt.

NiSource has guaranteed the payment of $4.7 billion of debt
for various wholly owned subsidiaries including Whiting Leasing, NiSource Finance, and through a
support agreement, Capital Markets, which is reflected on NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The subsidiaries are required to comply with certain financial covenants under the debt indenture
and in the event of default, NiSource would be obligated to pay the debt’s principal and related
interest. NiSource does not anticipate its subsidiaries will have any difficulty maintaining
compliance.



ITEM 8.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Guarantees Supporting Energy Commodity Contracts of Subsidiaries.

NiSource has issued guarantees,
which support up to approximately $634.4 million of commodity-related payments for its current
subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and trading and those satisfying requirements under
forward gas sales agreements of current and former subsidiaries. These guarantees were provided to
counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and
electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity-related contracts subject to
these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Lines and Letters of Credit.

NiSource Finance maintains a five-year revolving line of credit with
a syndicate of financial institutions which can be used either for borrowings or the issuance of
letters of credit. On July 7, 2006, NiSource Finance amended the $1.25 billion five-year revolving
credit facility, increasing the aggregate commitment level to $1.5 billion and extending the
termination date by one year to July 2011. During November 2006, NiSource Finance entered into a
new $300 million three-month revolving credit agreement with Dresdner Kleinwort that expired
February 15, 2007. At December 31, 2006, NiSource had $1,193.0 million in short-term
borrowings outstanding under both of the credit facilities. Through the five-year revolver and
through other letter of credit facilities, NiSource has issued stand-by letters of credit of
approximately $81.9 million for the benefit of third parties.

Other Guarantees or Obligations.

On June 29, 2006, Columbia Transmission, Piedmont, and Hardy
Storage entered into multiple agreements to finance the construction of the Hardy Storage project,
which is accounted for by NiSource as an equity investment. Under the financing agreement,
Columbia Transmission issued guarantees securing payment for 50% of any amounts issued in
connection with Hardy Storage up until such time as the project is placed in service and operated
within certain specified parameters. As of December 31, 2006, Hardy Storage borrowed $81.5 million
under the financing agreement, for which Columbia Transmission recorded an accrued liability of
approximately $1.6 million related to the fair value of its guarantee securing payment for 50% of
the $81.5 million borrowed.

As part of PEI’s sale to Private Power in 2003, NiSource retained certain obligations with respect
to the former PEI subsidiaries. NiSource retained operational guarantees related to environmental
compliance, inventory balances, employee relations, and a contingent obligation to Private Power
that could be triggered if U.S. Steel Gary Works exercised a purchase option under its agreement
with a former PEI subsidiary. At the time of the sale, NiSource allocated $0.6 million to this
contingent option obligation. However, in November 2005, U.S. Steel Gary Works announced its
intent to exercise the purchase option. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2005, NiSource
accrued an additional $7.4 million for the settlement of this obligation. In the second quarter of
2006, NiSource paid Private Power approximately $8.0 million to settle this obligation.

NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $82.5 million, which guarantee
performance of the seller’s covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and
warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees
are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource
would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the
aforementioned guarantees is remote.

NiSource has issued other guarantees supporting derivative related payments associated with
interest rate swap agreements issued by NiSource Finance, operating leases for many of its
subsidiaries and for other agreements entered into by its current and former subsidiaries.

D. Other Legal Proceedings.

In the normal course of its business, NiSource and its subsidiaries
have been named as defendants in various legal proceedings. In the opinion of management, the
ultimate disposition of these currently asserted claims will not have a material adverse impact on
NiSource’s consolidated financial position.

In the case of Tawney, et al. v. Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., the Plaintiffs, who are West
Virginia landowners, filed a lawsuit in early 2003 against CNR alleging that CNR underpaid
royalties on gas produced on their land by improperly deducting post-production costs and not
paying a fair value for the gas. In December 2004, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion to add
NiSource and Columbia as defendants. Plaintiffs also claimed that the defendants fraudulently
concealed the deduction of post-production charges. The court certified the case as a class action
that includes any person who, after July 31, 1990, received or is due royalties from CNR (and its
predecessors or

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

successors) on lands lying within the boundary of the state of West Virginia. All
claims by the government of the United States are excluded from the class. Although NiSource sold
CNR in 2003, NiSource remains obligated to manage this litigation and for the majority of any
damages ultimately awarded to the plaintiffs. On January 27, 2007 the jury hearing the case
returned a verdict against all defendants in the amount of $404.3 million; this is comprised of
$134.3 million in compensatory damages and $270 million in punitive damages. The defendants have
filed motions with the trial court challenging the award and a hearing on these motions is
anticipated in March of 2007. Unless the trial court substantially revises the jury’s verdict, the
defendants intend to appeal the judgment to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, which may
or may not accept the appeal. As of the end of 2006, NiSource increased its reserve for this
matter based on the jury’s verdict, but did not reserve any amount with regard to the punitive
damages portion of the verdict.

E. Income Tax Examinations.

NiSource records liabilities for potential income tax assessments.
The accruals relate to tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on
management’s estimate of the ultimate resolution of these positions. These liabilities may be
affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, or the expiration of the statute of limitations. NiSource is a part of the
IRS’s Large and Mid-Size Business program. As a result, each year’s federal income tax return is
typically audited by the IRS. Years through 1998 have been audited and are settled and closed to
further assessment. For years 1999 and 2000, NiSource disagreed with three adjustments proposed by
the IRS and filed a protest of those issues with the IRS Appeals Division. The opening Appeals
conference was held in March 2005 and negotiations were conducted throughout most of the remainder
of 2005. While concessions were made by both NiSource and the IRS during the Appeals process, the
parties were unable to reach agreement on the two most significant issues: deductibility of
certain costs associated with the Columbia acquisition and deductions related to the abandonment of
Wells LNG development costs at Granite State Gas. NiSource filed a petition with the Tax Court
with respect to these two issues on July 18, 2006. Initial discussions with the IRS trial
attorneys assigned to the case have begun. The audit of NiSource’s 2001 and 2002 federal income
tax returns was completed on June 1, 2005. With the exception of carryover adjustments related to
the two unagreed issues from the 1999-2000 audit discussed above, NiSource agreed with all proposed
IRS adjustments and paid the resultant tax liability in 2005. The audit of tax years 2003 and 2004
started in September 2005 and is expected to be completed toward the end of the first quarter of
2007. Management believes that adequate reserves have been provided for the unresolved issues.

F. Environmental Matters.

General.

The operations of NiSource are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations intended to protect the public health and the environment. Such
environmental laws and regulations affect operations as they relate to impacts on air, water and
land.

Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United
States and worldwide to reduce so-called “greenhouse gases” such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of
burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage
in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently
a participant in the EPA’s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in
developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

Gas Distribution Operations.

Several Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are potentially
responsible parties at waste disposal sites under the CERCLA (commonly known as Superfund) and
similar state laws, as well as at MGP sites, which such subsidiaries, or their corporate
predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries may be
required to share in the cost of cleanup of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution
Operations subsidiaries have responsibility for corrective action under the RCRA for closure and
cleanup costs associated with underground storage tanks, under the Toxic Substances Control Act for
cleanup of PCBs, and for mercury releases. The final costs of cleanup have not yet been
determined. As site investigations and cleanup proceed and as additional information becomes
available reserves are adjusted.

A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution
Operations subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has
identified up to 86 such sites and initial investigations have been conducted at 54 sites.
Additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 50 sites and remedial
measures have been implemented or completed at 28 sites. This effort includes



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

the sites contained in the January 2004 agreement entered into by the IDEM, Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas, and other
Indiana utilities under the Indiana Voluntary Remediation Program. Only those site investigation,
characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered “probable
and reasonably estimable” under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable,
reserves will be adjusted. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent
environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this
time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management
expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more
facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the
entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the SEC’s SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5 and SOP
No. 96-1. As of December 31, 2006, a reserve of approximately $57.1 million has been recorded to
cover probable environmental response actions for Gas Distribution Operations.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations.

Columbia Transmission continues to conduct
characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order
by Consent. The program pursuant to the Administrative Order by Consent covers approximately 245 facilities, approximately 13,000
liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage
well locations. Field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization
reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various
stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement
stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at most of the 245 facilities.
As of December 31, 2006, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets of Columbia Transmission was approximately $6.3 million.

Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are potentially responsible parties at several waste
disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws. The potential liability is believed to be de
minimis. However, the final allocation of cleanup costs has yet to be determined. As site
investigations and cleanups proceed and as additional information becomes available reserves will
be adjusted.

Implementation of the fine particulate matter and ozone national ambient air quality standards may
require imposition of additional controls on engines and turbines. On April 15, 2004, the EPA
finalized the eight-hour ozone nonattainment area designations. After designation, the Clean Air
Act provides for a process for promulgation of rules specifying compliance level, compliance
deadline, and necessary controls to be implemented within designated areas over the next few years.
Resulting state rules could require additional reductions in NOx emissions from natural gas
compressor stations. Also, on September 21, 2006, the EPA issued revisions to the NAAQS for
particulate matter. The final rule increased the stringency of the current fine particulate
(PM2.5) standard, added a new standard for inhalable coarse particulate (particulate matter between
10 and 2.5 microns in diameter), and revoked the annual PM10 standards while retaining the 24-hour
PM10 standards. The 24-hour primary and secondary standards for fine particulate were tightened
from the previous level of 65 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) to 35µg/m3 while the primary and
secondary annual standards were kept at 15µg/m3. The annual PM10 standards of 50µg/m3 were revoked
and the daily standards of 150µg/m3 were retained. State recommendations for designation of areas
not meeting the new fine particle standards are due November 2007 with EPA designations by November
2009, effective in April 2010. SIPs detailing how states will reduce emissions to meet the NAAQS
will be due three years later with attainment due by April 2015 with a possible five year extension
to April 2020. These actions could require further reductions in NOx emissions from various
emission sources in and near nonattainment areas, including reductions from Gas Transmission and
Storage Operations. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area and cannot
accurately estimate the timing or cost of emission controls at this time.

On August 6, 2006, Columbia Gulf received final approval of the NOx SIP Call Compliance Plan from
the state of Kentucky. This Plan will reduce NOx emissions by 950 tons per ozone season starting
May 1, 2007. Currently Columbia Gulf anticipates installation of approximately $6 million to $8
million in NOx controls to achieve these reductions.

In October, 2006, the Ohio EPA released a preliminary NOx control rule covering the Cleveland
non-attainment area. This could require additional controls at one or more compressor stations in
the area. Columbia Transmission is currently working with Ohio EPA on rule development.



ITEM 8.

In December 2006, the EPA released the final National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Air
Pollutants for Oil and Natural Gas Production Facilities. Columbia Transmission is currently
evaluating impacts to operations, but based on an initial review it does not appear to result in
significant cost or operational impacts.

Electric Operations.

Air.

In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to
comply with the EPA’s NOx SIP call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana,
to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower
regional transport of ozone. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules was required
by May 31, 2004. To comply with the rule, Northern Indiana developed a NOx compliance plan, which
included the installation of Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its
active generating stations and is currently in compliance with the NOx limits. In implementing the
NOx compliance plan; Northern Indiana has expended approximately $256 million as of December 31,
2006. Actual costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand and resource
constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for
additional control technology.

Implementation of the fine particulate matter and ozone national ambient air quality standards may
require imposition of additional controls on coal-fired boilers. On April 15, 2004, the EPA
finalized the eight-hour ozone nonattainment area designations. After designation, the Clean Air
Act provides for a process for promulgation of rules specifying compliance level, compliance
deadline, and necessary controls to be implemented within designated areas over the next few years.
Resulting state rules could require additional reductions in NOx emissions from these boilers.

On September 21, 2006, the EPA issued revisions to the NAAQS for particulate matter as described
above under, “Gas Transmission and Storage Operations.” The new rules set forth in this standard
could impact the emission control requirements for coal-fired boilers including Northern Indiana’s
electric generating stations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor developments in
this area and cannot accurately estimate the impact, timing or cost of emission controls at this
time.

On March 10, 2005, the EPA issued the CAIR final regulations. The rule establishes phased
reductions of NOx and SO2 from 28 Eastern states, including Indiana electric utilities, by
establishing an annual emissions cap for NOx and SO2 and an additional cap on NOx emissions during
the ozone control season. On March 15, 2006, the EPA signed three related rulemakings providing
final regulatory decisions on implementing the CAIR. The EPA, in one of the rulings, denied
several petitions for reconsideration of various aspects of the CAIR, including requests by
Northern Indiana to reconsider SO2 and NOx allocations. The main rulemaking established federal
implementation plans, or FIPs, for power plants to ensure that the emissions reductions required by
the CAIR are achieved on schedule and provide criteria, whereby SIPs that meet a majority of the
federal requirements or abbreviated SIPs could be approved if submitted by the states within six
months of the September 2006 deadline. As an affected state, Indiana structured, and preliminarily
adopted in June 2006, a draft rule to meet the EPA abbreviated CAIR SIP requirements and should
therefore be eligible for a six-month extension of the submittal deadline. The Air Pollution
Control Board adopted the final rules on November 1, 2006. The CAIR rules became effective in Indiana on February 25, 2007. In a petition
filed with the IURC in December 2006, Northern Indiana provided plans for the first phase of the
emission control construction required to address the Phase I CAIR requirements and a request for
appropriate cost treatment and recovery. Northern Indiana’s plan includes the upgrade of existing
emission controls on three generating units for an estimated cost of $23 million and anticipates
that these expenses are recoverable. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor
developments in this area and expects to install additional emission controls for the second phase
of CAIR, but cannot accurately estimate the timing or cost of the emission controls at this time.

On May 31, 2006, the EPA took final action on petitions to reconsider two actions regarding the air
pollutant Mercury: 1) its determination that regulation of electric utility steam generating units
under section 112 of the Clean Air Act was neither necessary nor appropriate (the section 112
rule); and 2) the CAMR. Following the promulgation of the final section 112 rule, the EPA received
two petitions for reconsideration. In response to the two petitions, the EPA agreed to reconsider
certain aspects of the final section 112 rule. After considering the petitions and the information
that was submitted during the public comment period, the EPA determined that its original rule was
correct. Indiana is developing a rule to implement the EPA CAMR. An initial draft of IDEM’s
proposed rule language was released for public comment in mid January of 2007 with a public hearing and



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

preliminary adoption scheduled for May. In related activity, the EPA initiated two measures as
a CAMR backstop. In the first, on December 14, 2006, the EPA published a notice that several
states, including Indiana, failed to submit their CAMR SIP by the November 17, 2006 deadline. Then
on December 22, 2006, the EPA published a proposed federal plan (FIP) that would be applicable to
the states identified in the December 14, 2006 notice to ensure CAMR emissions reductions are
achieved on schedule. The proposed FIP rule also includes assurances the provisions will no longer
apply upon EPA approval of the state plan. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor
developments in this area and cannot accurately estimate the timing or cost of emission controls at
this time.

Local air
quality has improved in three counties in which Northern Indiana generating assets are located.
In recognition of this improvement in local air quality, the IDEM prepared petitions for submittal
to the EPA seeking redesignation of the Indiana counties of Lake, Porter, and LaPorte to attainment
of the eight-hour ozone NAAQS. The IDEM held public hearings in the second quarter of 2006 to
satisfy the public notice requirements and subsequently submitted the petitions to the EPA. The
petitions included EPA required technical and procedural information, as well as optional technical
information, supporting the IDEM’s redesignation request and state plans to maintain the NAAQS
upon the EPA redesignations, if granted. On October 2, 2006, the IDEM announced 2006 ozone season
readings in these counties continued to meet air quality standards, reinforcing the supporting data
included in the redesignation petitions. Upon promulgation of the EPA and subsequent IDEM
regulations to implement the redesignations to attainment, new source review rules are expected to
change from nonattainment new source review rules to prevention of significant deterioration while
measures responsible for existing emission reductions would continue. Northern Indiana will
continue to closely monitor developments in this area and cannot accurately estimate the outcome or
timing of the approval of the petitions.

On April 15, 2004, the EPA proposed amendments to its July 1999 Regional Haze Rule that requires
states to set periodic goals for improving visibility in 156 natural areas across the United States
by implementing state emission reduction rules. These amendments would apply to the eligible
industrial facilities emitting air pollutants that reduce visibility. States must develop
implementation rules by January 2008. Resulting rules could require additional reductions of NOx,
SO2 and particulate matter from coal-fired boilers including Northern Indiana’s electric generating
stations, depending upon the outcome of multi-pollutant regulations. On July 6, 2005, the EPA
finalized Regional Haze Regulations and guidelines that allow states that opt to participate in the
CAIR cap-and-trade program to not require affected facilities to install, operate and maintain
additional control equipment. In 2006, the EPA made additional clarifications addressing technical
and procedural issues in October revisions to the rule and legal challenges to the earlier rules
sought by industry and environmental petitioners were denied by the courts on December 12. Until
the state rules are promulgated, the potential impact on Northern Indiana is uncertain. Northern
Indiana will continue to closely monitor developments in this area.

In late 1999 the EPA initiated a New Source Review enforcement action against several industries
including the electric utility industry concerning rule interpretations that have been the subject
of recent (prospective) reform regulations. Northern Indiana has received and responded to the EPA
information requests on this subject, most recently in June 2002. The EPA issued a NOV to Northern
Indiana on September 29, 2004, for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act and the SIP.
Specifically, the NOV alleges that modifications were made to certain boiler units at the Michigan
City, Schahfer, and Bailly Generating Stations between the years of 1985 and 1995 without obtaining
appropriate air permits for the modifications. Northern Indiana is unable, at this time, to
predict the timing or outcome of this EPA action.

Water.

The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative program is expected to add new water quality
standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern
Indiana’s three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The state of Indiana has
promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA
approval. The NPDES water discharge permit for Michigan City Generating Station has been issued
and became effective on April 1, 2006. Engineering studies have begun to determine specific
compliance costs for this facility. The permit for the Bailly Generating Station was issued on
June 26, 2006, and became effective on August 1, 2006. Northern Indiana has since appealed the
Bailly Generating Station NPDES permit, due to an unacceptable internal outfall monitoring permit
condition. Pending additional studies, the cost of complying with the permit requirements cannot
be estimated at this time.

On February 16, 2004, the EPA Administrator signed the Phase II Rule of the Clean Water Act Section
316(b) which requires all large existing steam electric generating stations meet certain
performance standards to reduce the



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

effects on aquatic organisms at their cooling water intake structures. The rule became effective on September 7, 2004. Under this rule, stations will either
have to demonstrate that the performance of their existing fish protection systems meet the new
standards or develop new systems, such as a closed-cycle cooling tower. On January 25, 2007, the
Second Circuit in a court decision on the Phase II 316(b) rule, remanded for EPA reconsideration
the options providing flexibility for meeting the requirements of the rule. Northern Indiana will
closely monitor the EPA resolution of the court decision on the Phase II 316(b) rule to determine
the compliance options for the Bailly Generating Station, the one remaining Northern Indiana
generating station operating without using closed-cycle cooling.

Remediation.

Northern Indiana is a potentially responsible party under the CERCLA and similar
state laws at two waste disposal sites and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other
potentially responsible parties. At one site, the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study
have been submitted for EPA review. At the second site, Northern Indiana has entered into EPA
Administrative Orders on Consent to perform an interim action, in conjunction with the landfill
owner/operator, which includes providing a municipal water supply system for approximately 275
homes. Northern Indiana has also agreed to conduct a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study
in the vicinity of the third party, state-permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for
fly ash disposal. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for
three facilities that historically stored hazardous waste.

As of December 31, 2006, a reserve of approximately $3.6 million has been recorded to cover
probable environmental response actions for Electric Operations. The ultimate liability in
connection with these sites cannot be estimated at this time but could be significant.

On March 31, 2005, the EPA and Northern Indiana entered into an Administrative Order on Consent
under the authority of Section 3008(h) of the RCRA for the Bailly Station. The order requires
Northern Indiana to identify the nature and extent of releases of hazardous waste and hazardous
constituents from the facility. Northern Indiana must also remediate any release of hazardous
constituents that present an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. A reserve has
been established to fund the required investigations and conduct interim measures at the facility.
The final costs of cleanup have not yet been determined. As site investigations and cleanup
proceed and as additional information becomes available reserves are adjusted.

On September 13, 2006, IDEM advised Northern Indiana that further investigation of historic
releases from two previously removed underground storage tanks at the Schahfer Generating Station
would need to be investigated. Northern Indiana is awaiting the results of an investigation that
was initiated in late 2006 before assessing any associated liability.

Other Operations.

NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liabilities, including cleanup
liabilities associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations,
petroleum operations, and CER. The most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP
sites whereas less significant liabilities are associated with former petroleum operations and
former mercury metering stations. In regards to these sites NiSource affiliate Columbia Petroleum
Corporation and five other companies received notice from the EPA on November 20, 2006 to enter
into an order to investigate and remediate four parcels which included the Macungie Bulk Terminal
once owned and operated by Columbia Petroleum Corporation for a limited duration. Negotiations
with the EPA and other parties is underway

The ultimate liability in connection with these contamination sites will depend upon many factors
including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible
parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only
those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered “probable and
reasonably estimable” under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96-1. As costs become probable and
reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any
environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable,
will not have a material adverse effect on NiSource’s financial position.

Environmental Reserves.

It is management’s continued intent to address environmental issues in
cooperation with regulatory authorities in such a manner as to achieve mutually acceptable
compliance plans. However, there can be

no
assurance that fines and penalties will not be incurred. Management expects a significant portion of environmental assessment and remediation
costs to be recoverable through rates for certain NiSource companies.

As of December 31, 2006, a reserve of approximately $72.6 million has been recorded to cover
probable corrective actions at sites where NiSource has environmental remediation liability.
Regulatory assets have been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be
recovered in rates. NiSource accrues for costs associated with environmental remediation
obligations when the incurrence of such costs is probable and the amounts can be reasonably
estimated, regardless of when the expenditures are actually made. The undiscounted estimated
future expenditures are based on many factors including currently enacted laws and regulations,
existing technology and estimated site-specific costs whereby assumptions may be made about the
nature and extent of site contamination, the extent of cleanup efforts, costs of alternative
cleanup methods and other variables. NiSource’s estimated environmental remediation liability will
be refined as events in the remediation process occur. Actual remediation costs may differ
materially from NiSource’s estimates due to the dependence on the factors listed above.

G. Operating and Capital Lease Commitments.

NiSource leases assets in several areas of its
operations. Payments made in connection with operating leases were $58.5 million in 2006, $54.7
million in 2005 and $62.4 million in 2004, and are primarily charged to operation and maintenance
expense as incurred. Capital leases and related accumulated depreciation included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets were $4.2 million and $2.3 million at December 31, 2006, and $3.8
million and $1.9 million at December 31, 2005, respectively.

Future minimum rental payments required under operating and capital leases that have initial
or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year are:

H. Purchase and Service Obligations.

NiSource has entered into various purchase and service
agreements whereby NiSource is contractually obligated to make certain minimum payments in future
periods. NiSource’s purchase obligations are for the purchase of physical quantities of natural
gas, electricity and coal. NiSource’s service agreements encompass a broad range of business
support and maintenance functions which are generally described below.

NiSource’s subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical
quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices.

NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and
storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2007 to 2026, require
NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges.

In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad
range of business process and support services to NiSource. As part of this agreement, IBM will
operate a broad range of business support functions for NiSource, including processes within the
human resources, finance and accounting, supply chain (procurement), customer contact,
meter-to-cash (billing and collections) and information technology areas. The agreement also
includes a broad array of transformational consulting services and emerging technology expertise.
The contract has a 10-year term and NiSource has the right to renew it for up to three additional
years. NiSource will pay for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The
variable charge component can fluctuate to reflect NiSource’s actual usage of service and service
levels. Fees may be adjusted to reflect economic changes such as inflation or business changes
that both parties agree to.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by
IBM), NiSource must pay IBM a termination charge that will include a breakage fee, repayment of
IBM’s un-recovered capital investments, and IBM wind-down expense. This termination fee can be a
material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the
termination.

NiSource’s other service obligations include agreements with certain rail companies, Pure Air and
General Electric.

Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation
services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various
periods through 2009.

Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products
and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under
this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a
combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be
due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty-year contract
period.

Whiting Clean Energy has a service agreement with General Electric for certain operation and
maintenance activities for its cogeneration facility located at BP’s Whiting , Indiana refinery for
which certain minimum fees are required. The agreement extends through 2023. The agreement
provides for a $10 million termination penalty to be paid by Whiting Clean Energy to General
Electric to buy out or otherwise terminate the agreement.

The estimated aggregate amounts of minimum fixed payments at December 31, 2006, were:

22. Segments of Business

Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is
available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to
allocate resources and in assessing performance.

NiSource’s operations are divided into four primary business segments. The Gas Distribution
Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and
industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana, Massachusetts,
Maine and New Hampshire. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas
transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers
located in northeastern, mid-Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia.
The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 21 counties in the northern part of
Indiana. The Other Operations segment primarily includes gas and power marketing, and ventures
focused on distributed power generation technologies, including cogeneration facilities, fuel cells
and storage systems.

The following table provides information about business segments. NiSource uses operating income
as its primary measurement for each of the reported segments and makes decisions on finance,
dividends and taxes at the corporate level on a consolidated basis. Segment revenues include
intersegment sales to affiliated subsidiaries, which are eliminated in consolidation. Affiliated
sales are recognized on the basis of prevailing market, regulated prices or at levels provided for
under contractual agreements. Operating income is derived from revenues and expenses directly
associated with each segment.

ITEM 9.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

NiSource Inc.

None.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

NiSource’s chief executive officer and its principal financial officer, after evaluating the
effectiveness of NiSource’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)), have concluded based on the evaluation required by paragraph (b) of
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 that, as of the end of the period covered by this report,
NiSource’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

NiSource management, including NiSource’s principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, are responsible for establishing and maintaining NiSource’s internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. However, management would note that a control system can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
NiSource’s management has adopted the framework set forth in the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission report, Internal Control — Integrated Framework, the most
commonly used and understood framework for evaluating internal control over financial reporting, as
its framework for evaluating the reliability and effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. During 2006, NiSource conducted an evaluation of its internal control over financial
reporting. Based on this evaluation, NiSource management concluded that NiSource’s internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual
report. Deloitte & Touche LLP, NiSource’s auditors, issued an attestation report on management’s
assessment of NiSource’s internal controls over financial reporting, which is contained within
their audit opinion in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Changes in Internal Controls

On July 1, 2006, NiSource began a multi-year process of transforming the information systems. As
its initial step in this process, NiSource began using new systems in the finance and accounting,
supply chain and human resource functions that support the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations,
Corporate and Other Operations segments. NiSource adjusted the internal controls that apply to
these functional areas to align them with the new systems and revised business processes.

As a part of this transformation, many new information technology systems and process changes have
an accelerated time-line for completion, increasing the risk of potential errors and control
failures which may have an impact on NiSource and its financial condition. In August, 2006,
NiSource and IBM decided to delay further implementation of certain information technology systems
due to difficulties encountered with the first wave of new system implementations. NiSource is
currently engaged in an overall assessment of the outsourcing initiative and is developing an
integrated plan that enables NiSource to achieve its business objectives going forward.

There have been no other changes in NiSource’s internal control over financial reporting during the
fiscal year covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect,
NiSource’s internal control over financial reporting.
