ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

NiSource Inc.

NiSource is an energy holding company whose subsidiaries provide natural gas, electricity and other
products and services to approximately 3.8 million customers located within a corridor that runs
from the Gulf Coast through the Midwest to New England. NiSource is the successor to an Indiana
corporation organized in 1987 under the name of NIPSCO Industries, Inc., which changed its name to
NiSource on April 14, 1999.

NiSource
is one of the nation’s largest natural gas distribution Companies as
measured by number of customers. NiSource’s principal subsidiaries include Columbia, a
vertically-integrated natural gas distribution, transmission and storage holding company whose
subsidiaries provide service to customers in the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast;
Northern Indiana, a vertically-integrated gas and electric company providing service to customers
in northern Indiana; and Bay State, a natural gas distribution company serving customers in
Massachusetts. NiSource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating
results of its fifteen direct subsidiaries.

NiSource’s business segments are: Gas Distribution Operations; Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations; Electric Operations; and Other Operations. Following is a summary of the business for
each reporting segment. Refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations”, for additional information for each segment.

Gas Distribution Operations

NiSource’s natural gas distribution operations serve more than 3.3 million customers in seven
states and operate approximately 58 thousand miles of pipeline. Through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Columbia, NiSource owns five distribution subsidiaries that provide natural gas to
approximately 2.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Virginia, Kentucky and Maryland. NiSource also distributes natural gas to approximately 792
thousand customers in northern Indiana through three subsidiaries: Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas
and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Additionally, NiSource’s subsidiary, Bay State, distributes
natural gas to approximately 294 thousand customers in Massachusetts.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations

NiSource’s Gas Transmission and Storage Operations subsidiaries own and operate nearly 15 thousand
miles of interstate pipelines and operate one of the nation’s largest underground natural gas
storage systems capable of storing approximately 639 Bcf of natural gas. Through its subsidiaries,
Columbia Transmission, Columbia Gulf and Crossroads Pipeline, NiSource owns and operates an
interstate pipeline network extending from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Erie, New York and the
eastern seaboard. Together, these companies serve customers in 16 northeastern, mid-Atlantic,
midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia.

NiSource’s Gas Transmission and Storage Operations continue to capture growth opportunities
leveraging NiSource’s strategically positioned pipeline and storage assets. A number of Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations’ new growth projects are designed to support increasing
Marcellus Shale production, while the company also has continued to grow and adapt its system to
provide critical transportation and storage services to markets across its high-demand service
territory. For example:

•

In April 2009, storage gas injections began for the Ohio Storage Expansion Project,
which increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations market-area storage capacity by 6.7
billion cubic feet and enhances delivery from two Ohio storage fields.

•

In August 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations placed in service its
Appalachian Expansion Project, which leverages the company’s existing infrastructure to
provide approximately 100,000 Dth per day of new transportation to three key Appalachian
producers.

•

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations advanced growth projects representing more than
$125 million in investment in the Marcellus Shale region during 2009, with potential to
provide market access for approximately 600,000 Dth per day of new natural gas supplies.


ITEM 1.

BUSINESS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations subsidiaries are also involved in two joint ventures,
Millennium and Hardy Storage, which effectively expand their facilities and throughput. Millennium
pipeline, which includes 182 miles of 30-inch-diameter pipe across New York’s Southern Tier and
lower Hudson Valley, was substantially completed in December 2008 and has the capability to
transport up to 525,400 Dth per day of natural gas to markets along its route, as well as to the
New York City markets through its pipeline interconnections. Millennium is jointly owned by
affiliates of NiSource, DTE Energy and National Grid. Hardy Storage commenced operations in April
of 2007, receiving customer injections and withdrawing natural gas from its new underground natural
gas storage facility in West Virginia. Hardy Storage has a working storage capacity of 12 Bcf and
the ability to deliver 176,000 Dth of natural gas per day. Hardy Storage is a joint venture of
subsidiaries of Columbia Transmission and Piedmont.

Electric Operations

NiSource generates, transmits and distributes electricity through its subsidiary Northern Indiana
to approximately 457 thousand customers in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana and engages
in wholesale and transmission transactions. Northern Indiana owns four and operates three
coal-fired electric generating stations. The three operating facilities have a net capability of
2,574 mw. Northern Indiana also owns and operates Sugar Creek, a CCGT plant with a 535 mw capacity
rating, four gas-fired generating units located at Northern Indiana’s coal-fired electric
generating stations with a net capability of 203 mw and two hydroelectric generating plants with a
net capability of 10 mw. These facilities provide for a total system operating net capability of
3,322 mw. Sugar Creek was purchased in May, 2008 and dispatched into MISO on December 1, 2008.
Northern Indiana’s transmission system, with voltages from 69,000 to 345,000 volts, consists of
2,792 circuit miles. Northern Indiana is interconnected with five neighboring electric utilities.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, Northern Indiana generated 85.2% and purchased 14.8% of
its electric requirements. Northern Indiana’s Mitchell Station, indefinitely shut down in 2002, is
not included in the net capacity of the three coal-fired generation stations. In the electric base
rate case Northern Indiana filed in August 2008, Northern Indiana provided testimony that it
intends to retire the Mitchell Station, demolish it, and remediate the site to industrial
condition, subject to the ability to recover these costs.

Northern Indiana participates in the MISO transmission service and wholesale energy market. The
MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with the FERC, to improve the flow of
electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Additionally, MISO is
responsible for managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, managing the
day-ahead, real-time and FTRs markets and managing the ancillary market. Northern Indiana
transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO and transmission service
for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff.

Other Operations

NiSource has made a decision to significantly scale back the unregulated natural gas marketing
activities. The move is part of NiSource’s long-term strategy of focusing on its core regulated
businesses. NiSource has notified its current customers of this decision.

Divestiture of Non-Core Assets

In recent years, NiSource sold certain businesses judged to be non-core to NiSource’s strategy.
NiSource sold Whiting Clean Energy to BPAE in April 2008 for $216.7 million which included $16.1
million in working capital. In December 2008, NiSource sold Northern Utilities and Granite State
Gas for $209.1 million which included $49.1 million in working capital. Columbia Gulf sold a
portion of Columbia Gulf’s offshore assets to Tennessee Gas Pipeline in June 2008. Lake Erie Land,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of NiSource, sold its Sand Creek Golf Club assets in June 2006, to a
private real estate developer. Lake Erie Land is pursuing the sale of certain other real estate
assets it owns. NiSource Corporate Services is continuing to work with several potential buyers to
sell its Marble Cliff facility. NDC Douglas Properties, a subsidiary of NiSource Development
Company, is in the process of exiting some of its low income housing investments.

Business Strategy

NiSource focuses its business strategy on its core, rate-regulated asset-based businesses with
virtually 100% of its operating income generated from the rate-regulated businesses. With the
nation’s fourth largest natural gas pipeline,


ITEM 1.

BUSINESS (continued

)

NiSource INC.

the largest natural gas distribution network east of the Rocky Mountains and one of the nation’s
largest natural gas storage networks, NiSource operates throughout the energy-intensive corridor
that extends from the supply areas in the Gulf Coast through the consumption centers in the
Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, New England and Northeast. This corridor includes over 40% of the nation’s
population and close to 50% of its natural gas consumption. NiSource continues to position its
assets to meet the corridor’s growing energy needs.

Competition and Changes in the Regulatory Environment

The regulatory frameworks applicable to NiSource’s operations, at both the state and federal
levels, continue to evolve. These changes have had and will continue to have an impact on
NiSource’s operations, structure and profitability. Management continually seeks new ways to be
more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including providing gas customers
with increased choices for products and services.

Natural Gas Competition.

Open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the
deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets. LDC
customers and marketers purchase gas directly from producers and marketers and an open, competitive
market for gas supplies has emerged. This separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and
other services offered by pipelines and LDCs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent
of services provided by the pipelines and LDCs. The LDCs continue to purchase gas and recover the
associated costs from their customers. NiSource’s Gas Distribution Operations’ subsidiaries are
involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas
requirements from third parties and use the NiSource Gas Distribution Operations’ subsidiaries for
transportation services.

Electric Competition.

Northern Indiana currently dispatches all power from its plants into the
MISO. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission
Tariff.

Financing Subsidiary

NiSource Finance is a wholly-owned, consolidated finance subsidiary of NiSource that engages in
financing activities to raise funds for the business operations of NiSource and its subsidiaries.
NiSource Finance was incorporated in February 2000 under the laws of the state of Indiana.
NiSource Finance’s obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NiSource.

Other Relevant Business Information

NiSource’s customer base is broadly diversified, with no single customer accounting for a
significant portion of revenues.

As of December 31, 2009, NiSource had 7,616 employees of whom 3,261 were subject to collective
bargaining agreements.

For a listing of certain subsidiaries of NiSource refer to Exhibit 21.

NiSource files various reports with the SEC. The reports include the annual report on Form 10-K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed
or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. NiSource
makes all SEC filings available without charge to the public on its web site at

.


ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

NiSource Inc.

There are many factors that could have a material adverse effect on NiSource’s operating results,
financial condition and cash flows. New risks may emerge at any time, and NiSource cannot predict
those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance. Each of the
risks described below could adversely impact the value of NiSource’s securities.

NiSource has substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial condition.

NiSource has a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding, in part, as a result of the
acquisitions of Columbia and Bay State. NiSource had total consolidated indebtedness of $6,787.4
million outstanding as of December 31, 2009. The substantial indebtedness could have important
consequences to investors. For example, it could:

Some of NiSource’s debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debt-to-capital ratios
and cross-default provisions. NiSource’s failure to comply with any of these covenants could
result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of
outstanding debt obligations. Additionally, a drop in NiSource’s credit rating could adversely
impact the cost for NiSource to issue new debt securities.

A drop in NiSource’s credit rating could adversely impact NiSource’s liquidity.

On December 15, 2009, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB-, and the
existing ratings of all other rated subsidiaries. Fitch’s outlook for NiSource and all of its
rated subsidiaries is stable. On November 24, 2009, Moody’s Investors Service affirmed the senior
unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other rated subsidiaries,
and revised the outlook to stable from negative. On March 5, 2009, Standard and Poor’s affirmed
its senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its rated subsidiaries at BBB-, and revised the
outlook to stable from negative. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a
downgrade by Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s or Fitch would result in a rating that is below
investment grade.

Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased
collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB- by
Standard and Poor’s or Baa3 by Moody’s. The additional collateral that would be required in the
event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $24 million.
In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain “adequate
assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support
such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. In addition, under Northern
Indiana’s trade receivables sales program, it is an event of termination if Northern Indiana’s debt
rating is withdrawn by either Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s or falls below BB, or Ba2 at either
Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohio’s trade receivables
sales program, it is an event of termination if NiSource’s debt rating is withdrawn by either
Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s or falls below BB- or Ba3 at either Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s,
respectively.

Additionally, as a result of NiSource’s participation in certain derivative activities, a credit
downgrade could cause NiSource to be required to post substantial collateral in support of past and
current operations. These collateral requirements, combined with other potential negative effects
on NiSource’s liquidity in the event of a credit downgrade below an investment grade rating, could
have a material adverse effect on earnings potential and cash flows.

Lastly, a
credit downgrade could adversely affect the availability and cost of
capital needed to fund the growth investments which are a central
element of the Company’s long-term business strategy.


ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

NiSource may not be able to execute its growth strategy as planned.

Because of changes in the business environment and business strategy, NiSource may not be able to
execute its four-part business plan as intended. Our commercial and regulatory initiatives may not
achieve planned results; levels of commercial growth and expansion of the gas transmission and
storage business may be less than our plan has anticipated; and the actual results of our financial
management of the balance sheet, and process and expense management could deviate materially from
planned outcomes.

Continued adverse economic and market conditions or increases in interest rates could reduce net
revenue growth, increase costs, decrease future net income and cash flows and impact capital
resources and liquidity needs.

The credit markets and the general economy have been experiencing a period of large-scale turmoil
and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale of various financial
institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States federal government.
While the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted, it may have an adverse material
effect on NiSource.

A continued decline in the economy impacting NiSource’s operating jurisdictions could adversely
affect NiSource’s ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers, which
could reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs. An increase in the interest rates
NiSource pays would adversely affect future net income and cash flows. In addition, NiSource
depends on debt to finance its operations, including both working capital and capital expenditures,
and would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates. The current economic downturn and
tightening of access to credit markets, coupled with NiSource’s current credit ratings, could
impact NiSource’s ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt at a reasonable cost. Refer
to Note 16, “Long-Term Debt,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information
related to outstanding long-term debt and maturities of that debt.

Capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which
then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings.

The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to
satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
NiSource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts.
These assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns, which fall below
NiSource’s projected rates of return. A decline in the market value of assets may increase the
funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement
benefit plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit
plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, which could potentially increase
funding requirements. Further, the funding requirements of the obligations related to these
benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant
demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions.
Ultimately, significant funding requirements and increased pension expense could negatively impact
NiSource’s results of operations and financial position.

NiSource’s costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant. The costs of compliance
with future environmental laws and the incurrence of environmental liabilities could impact cash
flow and profitability.

NiSource’s subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental
requirements that, among other things, regulate air emissions, water usage and discharges,
remediation and the management of chemicals, hazardous waste and solid waste. Compliance with
these legal obligations requires NiSource to make expenditures for installation of pollution
control equipment, remediation, environmental monitoring, emissions fees and permits at many of
NiSource’s facilities. These expenditures are significant, and NiSource expects that they will
continue to be significant in the future.

If NiSource’s subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to
the environment or persons, even if caused by factors beyond NiSource’s control, that failure or
harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against NiSource and
its subsidiaries. In September 2004, the EPA issued an NOV to Northern Indiana alleging violations
of the new source review provisions of the CAA. An adverse


ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

outcome in this matter could require capital expenditures beyond the EPA requirements that cannot
be determined at this time and could require payment of substantial penalties.

Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to
protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to NiSource’s subsidiaries. Revised or
additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating
restrictions on NiSource’s facilities or increased compliance costs, which may not be fully
recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income. The cost impact of any new or
amended legislation would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at
this time.

Because NiSource operations deal with natural gas and coal fossil fuels, emissions of GHGs are an
expected aspect of the business. While NiSource attempts to reduce GHG emissions through
efficiency programs, leak detection, and other programs, GHG emissions cannot be entirely
eliminated. Future legislative and regulatory programs could significantly restrict emissions of
GHGs or could impose a cost or tax on GHG emissions. Recently, proposals have been developed to
implement state and regional GHG programs, to create federal legislation to limit GHG emissions
(such as the Waxman-Markey bill, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives, and the
Kerry-Boxer draft bill which is currently being debated in the U.S. Senate), and to create national
renewable portfolio standards. In addition, in December 2009, the EPA declared carbon dioxide and
several other GHG to be a danger to public health and welfare, which is the first step towards the
EPA regulating GHG under the CAA. Imposing statutory or regulatory restrictions and/or costs on
GHG emissions could increase NiSource’s cost of producing energy, which could impact customer
demand or NiSource’s profitability. Compliance costs associated with these requirements could also
affect NiSource’s cash flow. The cost impact of any new or amended legislation would depend upon
the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time.

The Federal government continues to show interest in developing regulations covering coal
combustion byproducts. Legislation regulating coal ash pursuant to the Surface Mining Control and
Reclamation Act has been introduced and the EPA is reviewing its previous determination that
Federal regulation of coal ash as a RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste is not appropriate. The EPA
intends to propose regulation of coal combustion byproducts in early 2010. These proposed
regulations could affect Northern Indiana’s ongoing byproduct reuse programs and could impose
additional requirements on its management of coal ash wastes. Northern Indiana will monitor
developments in this matter and cannot estimate the potential financial impact at this time.

A significant portion of the gas and electricity NiSource sells is used by residential and
commercial customers for heating and air conditioning. Accordingly, the operating results
fluctuate depending on the weather and, to a certain extent, usage of gas or electricity.

Energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather. Forecasts of energy sales are based on normal
weather, which represents a long-term historical average. Significant variations from normal
weather could have, and have had, a material impact on energy sales. Additionally, residential
usage, and to some degree commercial usage, have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity
costs for gas and electricity, whereby usage declines with increased costs, thus affecting
NiSource’s financial results. Lastly, residential and commercial customers’ usage has shown to be
sensitive to economic conditions and the impact of macro-economic drivers such as unemployment,
consumption and consumer confidence, which could also affect NiSource’s financial results.

NiSource’s business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries.

Business operations throughout NiSource’s service territories have been and may continue to be
adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where we operate. In
particular, sales to large industrial customers may be impacted by economic downturns. The U.S.
manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international
competition, increasing costs, and fluctuating demand for their products.

The majority of NiSource’s net revenues is subject to economic regulation and is exposed to the
impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings.


ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Virtually
all of NiSource’s net revenues are subject to
economic regulation at either the federal or state level. As such, the net revenues generated
by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority.
 These rate reviews determine the energy rates charged to customers
and directly impact revenues. NiSource’s
financial results are dependent on more frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely
recovery of costs. For example, the outcome of the currently pending electric rate case, and the electric and gas rate
cases anticipated to be filed in 2010, could have a material effect
on NiSource’s financial results. Additionally,
the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant, and their
recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approval.

As a result of efforts to introduce market-based
competition in certain of the markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations, NiSource may compete with
independent marketers for customers. This competition exposes NiSource to the risk that certain stranded costs may
not be recoverable and may affect results of NiSource’s growth strategy and cash flows.

Fluctuations in the price or supply of fuel commodities or their related transportation costs may
have a negative impact on our financial results.

Much of the electric generating fleet is dependent on coal. As a result, NiSource’s profitable
operation of these assets is vulnerable to price fluctuations, fuel supply disruptions and
fluctuations in associated transportation costs. Continuing access to natural gas supplies is
also critical to serve utility gas customers. Hedging activities have been deployed in order to
offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices and NiSource relies on regulatory recovery
mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the costs incurred in operations.
However, while NiSource has historically been successful in recovery of costs related to commodity
costs, there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates.
Additionally, increased gas and electricity costs could result in reduced demand from customers as
a result of increased conservation activities.

NiSource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services,
and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating
agreements.

NiSource’s extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy, involves considerable
judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition, credit
history and other factors. Credit risk exposure is monitored by obtaining credit reports and
updated financial information for customers and suppliers, and by evaluating the financial status
of its banking partners and other counterparties through the use of market-based metrics such as
credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the
major credit rating agencies. Continued adverse economic conditions could increase credit risk and
could result in a material adverse effect on NiSource.

NiSource has significant goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets. An impairment of goodwill
or definite-lived intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earnings.

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, NiSource tests goodwill for impairment
at least annually and reviews its definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill would also
be tested for impairment when factors, examples of which include, reduced cash flow estimates, a
sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value, indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable. NiSource would be required to record a charge in the
financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or definite-lived
intangible assets is determined, negatively impacting the results of operations. A significant
charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under the five-year revolving credit
facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not
exceed 70%. A similar covenant in the 2005 private placement requires NiSource to maintain a debt
to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%.

Changes in taxation and our ability to quantify such changes could adversely affect NiSource’s
financial results.

NiSource is subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal, state and local
levels where it does business. Legislation or regulation which could affect NiSource’s tax burden
could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities. NiSource cannot predict the timing or
extent of such tax-related developments, which could have a negative impact on the financial
results. Additionally, NiSource uses its best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for
these tax obligations. However, a challenge by a taxing authority, our ability to utilize tax


ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits, or a deviation from other tax-related assumptions
may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates.

Changes in accounting principles may adversely affect NiSource’s financial results.

Future changes in accounting rules, such as IFRS, and associated changes in regulatory accounting
may negatively impact the way NiSource records revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These
changes in accounting standards may adversely affect its financial results.

Aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations, which could
negatively impact our financial results.

NiSource has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets. The age of these assets may result
in them being more costly to maintain and susceptible to unscheduled outages in spite of diligent
efforts by NiSource to properly maintain these assets through inspection, scheduled maintenance and
capital investment. The failure of such assets could result in increased expenses which may not be
fully recoverable from customers and/or a reduction in revenue.

Climate change, natural disasters, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events may disrupt
operations and reduce the ability to service customers.

A disruption or failure of natural gas transmission, storage or distribution systems or within
electric generation, transmission or distribution systems in the event of a major hurricane,
tornado, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales,
providing services, or performing other critical functions. NiSource has experienced disruptions
in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature. The cost, availability
and sufficiency of insurance for these risks could adversely affect NiSource’s results of
operations, financial position and cash flows.

There is also a concern that climate change may exacerbate the risks to physical infrastructure
associated with heat and extreme weather conditions. Climate change and the costs that may be
associated with its impacts have the potential to affect NiSource’s business in many ways,
including increasing the cost NiSource incurs in providing its products and services, impacting the
demand for and consumption of its products and services (due to change in both costs and weather
patterns), and affecting the economic health of the regions in which NiSource operates.

PROPERTIES

NiSource Inc.

Discussed below are the principal properties held by NiSource and its subsidiaries as of December
31, 2009.

Gas Distribution Operations.

NiSource’s Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries own and operate a
total of 57,785 miles of pipelines and certain related facilities. This includes: (i) for the
five distribution subsidiaries of its Columbia system, 35,474 miles of pipelines, 1,350 reservoir
acres of underground storage, eight storage wells, liquid propane facilities with a capacity of 1.8

total capacity of 21.8 million gallons and liquid propane facilities with a capacity of 1.5 million
gallons (iv) for its Northern Indiana Fuel and Light system, 967 miles of pipelines, and (v) for
its Kokomo Gas system, 1,041 miles of pipelines and an LNG facility with a capacity of 4.9 million
gallons. The physical properties of the NiSource gas utilities are located throughout Ohio,
Indiana, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, and Massachusetts.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations.

NiSource Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries own
and operate approximately 14,926 miles of jurisdictional interstate natural gas transmission
pipeline. Columbia Transmission owns and leases approximately 773 thousand acres of underground
storage, 3,541 storage wells, 11,332 miles of interstate pipeline and 92 compressor stations with
625,555 hp of installed capacity. Columbia Transmission’s operations are located in Delaware,
Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West
Virginia and the District of Columbia. Columbia Gulf has 3,392 miles of transmission pipeline and
11 compressor stations with 470,988 hp of installed capacity. Columbia Gulf’s operations are
located in Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming. Crossroads Pipeline has
202 miles of transmission pipeline and one compressor station with 3,000 hp of installed capacity.
Crossroads Pipeline’s operations are located in Indiana and Ohio. NiSource Gas Transmission and
Storage Operations’ offices are headquartered in Houston, Texas.

Electric Operations.

NiSource generates, transmits and distributes electricity through its
subsidiary Northern Indiana to approximately 457 thousand customers in 20 counties in the northern
part of Indiana and engages in wholesale and transmission transactions. Northern Indiana owns four
and operates three coal-fired electric generating stations. The three operating facilities have a
net capability of 2,574 mw. Northern Indiana also owns and operates Sugar Creek, a CCGT plant with
a 535 mw capacity rating, four gas-fired generating units located at Northern Indiana’s coal-fired
electric generating stations with a net capability of 203 mw and two hydroelectric generating
plants with a net capability of 10 mw. These facilities provide for a total system operating net
capability of 3,322 mw. Sugar Creek was purchased in May, 2008 and dispatched into MISO on
December 1, 2008. Northern Indiana’s transmission system, with voltages from 69,000 to 345,000
volts, consists of 2,792 circuit miles. Northern Indiana is interconnected with five neighboring
electric utilities.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, Northern Indiana generated 85.2% and purchased 14.8% of
its electric requirements. Northern Indiana’s Mitchell Station, indefinitely shut down in 2002, is
not included in the net capacity of the three coal-fired generation stations. In the electric base
rate case Northern Indiana filed in August 2008, Northern Indiana provided testimony that it
intends to retire the Mitchell Station, demolish it, and remediate the site to industrial
condition, subject to the ability to recover these costs.

Other Operations.

NiSource owns the Southlake Complex, its 325,000 square foot headquarters
building located in Merrillville, Indiana and other residential and development property.

NiSource Inc.

Character of Ownership.

The principal offices and properties of NiSource and its subsidiaries are
held in fee and are free from encumbrances, subject to minor exceptions, none of which are of such
a nature as to impair substantially the usefulness of such properties. Many of the offices in
various communities served are occupied by subsidiaries of NiSource under leases. All properties
are subject to liens for taxes, assessments and undetermined charges (if any) incidental to
construction. It is NiSource’s practice regularly to pay such amounts, as and when due, unless
contested in good faith. In general, the electric lines, gas pipelines and related facilities are
located on land not owned in fee but are covered by necessary consents of various governmental
authorities or by appropriate rights obtained from owners of private property. NiSource does not,
however, generally have specific easements from the owners of the property adjacent to public
highways over, upon or under which its electric lines and gas distribution pipelines are located.
At the time each of the principal properties was purchased a title search was made. In general, no
examination of titles as to rights-of-way for electric lines, gas pipelines or related facilities
was made, other than examination, in certain cases, to verify the grantors’ ownership and the lien
status thereof.


ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

NiSource Inc.

1. Tawney, et al. v. Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., Roane County, WV Circuit Court

The Plaintiffs, who are West Virginia landowners, filed a lawsuit in early 2003 in the West
Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County, West Virginia (the “Trial Court”) against CNR alleging
that CNR underpaid royalties on gas produced on their land by improperly deducting post-production
costs and not paying a fair value for the gas. Plaintiffs also claimed that Defendants
fraudulently concealed the deduction of post-production charges. In December 2004, the Trial Court
granted Plaintiffs’ motion to add NiSource and Columbia as Defendants. The Trial Court later
certified the case as a class action that includes any person who, after July 31, 1990, received or
is due royalties from CNR (and its predecessors or successors) on lands lying within the boundary
of the state of West Virginia. Although NiSource sold CNR in 2003, NiSource remained obligated to
manage this litigation and was responsible for the majority of any damages awarded to Plaintiffs.
On January 27, 2007, the jury hearing the case returned a verdict against all Defendants in the
amount of $404.3 million inclusive of both compensatory and punitive damages; Defendants
subsequently filed their Petition for Appeal, which was later amended, with the West Virginia
Supreme Court of Appeals (the “Appeals Court”), which refused the petition on May 22, 2008. On
August 22, 2008, Defendants filed Petitions to the United States Supreme Court for writ of
certiorari. Given the Appeals Court’s earlier refusal of the appeal, NiSource adjusted its reserve
in the second quarter of 2008 to reflect the portion of the Trial Court judgment for which NiSource
would be responsible, inclusive of interest. This amount was included in “Legal and environmental
reserves,” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008. On October 24, 2008, the
Trial Court preliminarily approved a Settlement Agreement with a total settlement amount of $380
million. The settlement received final approval by the Trial Court on November 22, 2008.
NiSource’s share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its
obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund
by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the
amount of $254 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the
settlement, which has since been drawn down as settlement payments have been made. The Trial Court
entered its Order discharging the judgment on January 20, 2009 and is supervising the
administration of the settlement proceeds. As of December 31, 2009, NiSource has contributed a
total of $277.3 million into the qualified settlement fund, $25 million of which was contributed in
2008. As of December 31, 2009, $61.5 million of the maximum settlement liability has not been
paid. NiSource has since contributed  an additional $18.0 million. The remaining
balance of the letter of credit is sufficient to cover any remaining payments under the Settlement
Agreement. NiSource will be required to make additional payments, pursuant to the settlement, upon
notice from the Class Administrator.

2. Environmental Protection Agency Notice of Violation

On September 29, 2004, the EPA issued an NOV to Northern Indiana for alleged violations of the CAA
and the Indiana SIP. The NOV alleges that modifications were made to certain boiler units at three
of Northern Indiana’s generating stations between the years 1985 and 1995 without obtaining
appropriate air permits for the modifications. The ultimate resolution could require additional
capital expenditures and operations and maintenance costs as well as payment of substantial
penalties and development of supplemental environmental projects. Northern Indiana is currently in
discussions with the EPA regarding possible resolutions to this NOV. Although penalties have been
proposed and a reserve has been recorded for the matter, Northern Indiana is unable to predict the
outcome of this matter at this time.

3. Majorsville Operations Center – PADEP Notice of Violation

In 1995, Columbia Transmission entered into an AOC with the EPA that requires Columbia Transmission
to characterize and remediate environmental contamination at thousands of locations along Columbia
Transmission’s pipeline system. One of the facilities subject to the AOC is the Majorsville
Operations Center, which was remediated under an EPA approved Remedial Action Work Plan in summer
2008. Pursuant to the Remedial Action Work Plan, Columbia Transmission completed a project that
stabilized residual oil contained in soils at the site and in sediments in an adjacent stream.

On April 23, 2009, however, the PADEP issued Columbia Transmission an NOV, alleging that the
remediation was not effective. The NOV asserts violations of the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law
and the Pennsylvania Solid Waste Management Act and contains a settlement demand in the amount of
$1 million. Columbia Transmission is unable to estimate the likelihood or cost of potential
penalties or additional remediation at this time.

outstanding.

Holders of shares of NiSource’s common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, and if
declared by NiSource’s Board out of funds legally available. The policy of the Board has been to
declare cash dividends on a quarterly basis payable on or about the 20th day of February, May,
August and November. NiSource paid quarterly common dividends totaling $0.92 per share for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. At its January 19, 2010 meeting, the Board declared
a quarterly common dividend of $0.23 per share, payable on February 19, 2010 to holders of record
on January 29, 2010.

Although the Board currently intends to continue the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on
common shares, the timing and amount of future dividends will depend on the earnings of NiSource’s
subsidiaries, their financial condition, cash requirements, regulatory restrictions, any
restrictions in financing agreements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.

Note regarding forward-looking statements

The Management’s Discussion and Analysis, including statements regarding market risk sensitive
instruments, contains “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Investors and prospective investors should understand that many factors govern whether
any forward-looking statement contained herein will be or can be realized. Any one of those
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning NiSource’s plans,
objectives, expected performance, expenditures and recovery of expenditures through rates, stated
on either a consolidated or segment basis, and any and all underlying assumptions and other
statements that are other than statements of historical fact. From time to time, NiSource may
publish or otherwise make available forward-looking statements of this nature. All such subsequent
forward-looking statements, whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of NiSource,
are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. All forward-looking statements are
based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance
that actual results will not differ materially.

Realization of NiSource’s objectives and expected performance is subject to a wide range of risks
and can be adversely affected by, among other things, weather, fluctuations in supply and demand
for energy commodities, growth opportunities for NiSource’s businesses, increased competition in

CONSOLIDATED REVIEW

Executive Summary

NiSource is an energy holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 whose
subsidiaries are engaged in the transmission, storage and distribution of natural gas in the
high-demand energy corridor stretching from the Gulf Coast through the Midwest to New England and
the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in Indiana. NiSource generates
virtually 100% of its operating income through these rate-
regulated businesses. A significant portion of NiSource’s operations is subject to seasonal
fluctuations in sales. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March,
net revenues from gas sales are more significant, and during the cooling season, which is primarily
from June through September, net revenues from electric sales and transportation services are more
significant than in other months.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, NiSource reported income from continuing operations
of $231.2 million, or $0.84 per basic share, compared to $370.6 million, or $1.35 per basic share
for the same period in 2008.

Decreases in income from continuing operations were due primarily to the following items:

Decreases in income from continuing operations were partially offset due to the following items:

•

Gas Distribution Operations’ net revenues increased by $66.7 million due primarily to
increased revenues of $97.2 million from regulatory initiatives including impacts from rate
proceedings, partly offset by decreased industrial and residential usage, lower off-system
sales revenues and the impact of weather.

•

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations’ net revenues increased by $65.4 million due
primarily to increases in firm capacity reservation fees principally from growth projects such
as the Eastern Market Expansion, the Ohio Storage Expansion and new Appalachian supply
contracts, increases in shorter-term transportation and storage services, and mineral rights
leasing.

These factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the
following discussions of “Results of Operations” and “Results and Discussion of Segment
Operations.”

Four-Point Platform for Growth

NiSource’s four key initiatives to build a platform for long-term, sustainable growth continue to
comprise commercial and regulatory initiatives; commercial growth and expansion of the gas
transmission and storage business; financial management of the balance sheet; and process and
expense management.

Commercial and Regulatory Initiatives

Rate Development and Other Regulatory Matters.

NiSource is moving forward on regulatory
initiatives across several distribution company markets and progress continues with Northern
Indiana’s electric base rate case. Whether through full rate case filings or other approaches,
NiSource’s goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as it addresses changing
customer conservation patterns, develops more contemporary pricing structures, and embarks on
long-term investment programs to enhance its infrastructure.

On June 27, 2008, Northern Indiana filed a petition for new electric base rates and charges. It
has been more than 22 years since Northern Indiana has had an electric base rate increase. Several
stakeholder groups have intervened in the case, representing customer groups and various counties
and towns within Northern Indiana’s electric service territory. Evidentiary hearings concluded on
August 6, 2009, and the briefing schedule concluded in January 2010. The case is expected to be
resolved with new electric rates effective during the first half of 2010.

Northern Indiana received a favorable regulatory order on February 18, 2009 related to its actions
to increase its electric generating capacity and advance its electric rate case. Acting on a
settlement reached among Northern Indiana and its regulatory stakeholders, the IURC ruled that
Northern Indiana’s Sugar Creek electric generating plant was in service for ratemaking purposes as
of December 1, 2008. The IURC also approved the deferral of depreciation expenses and carrying
costs associated with the $330 million Sugar Creek investment. Northern Indiana purchased Sugar
Creek on May 30, 2008 and effective December 1, 2008, Sugar Creek was accepted as an internal
designated network resource within the MISO.

Northern Indiana anticipates filing another electric base rate case during 2010. Among other
things, the filing is expected to include the effect of increased pension expense, as well as
demand levels based on more recent operating experience.

Northern Indiana currently has plans underway for the filing of a gas rate case, the first since
1987. The filing is expected to be made in 2010, with new rates anticipated to be effective in
early 2011.

On January 15, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO requesting authority
to increase Columbia of Ohio’s PIPP rider rate in order to collect $82.2 million in PIPP arrearages
over a period of three years, in addition to the projected level of arrearages expected to occur
during each of the succeeding twelve-month periods. On March 3, 2009, Columbia of Ohio’s proposal
was approved and became effective.

On
January  30, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application
 with the PUCO to implement a gas supply auction. The auction will
replace Columbia’s current GCR mechanism for
 providing commodity gas supplies to its sales customers. By order dated December 2, 2009, the PUCO approved a
stipulation that resolved all issues in the case. Pursuant to the stipulation, Columbia will conduct two consecutive
one-year long standard service offer auction periods starting April
2010 and April 2011. On February 23, 2010, Columbia
 held the first standard service offer auction which resulted in a final retail price adjustment of $1.93 per mcf.
 On February 24, the PUCO issued an Entry that approved the results of the auction and directed Columbia to proceed
with the implementation of the standard service offer process.

On February 27, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application to adjust rates associated with Rider
IRP. Rider IRP recovers costs associated with the replacement of natural gas risers that are prone
to failure; maintenance, repair and replacement of customers service lines; an Accelerated Mains
Replacement Program; and installation of Automatic Meter Reading Devices. On June 2, 2009, Columbia
of Ohio filed a Joint Stipulation and Recommendation that settled all issues. On June 24, 2009, the
PUCO issued an Order approving the Stipulation. Rates associated with Rider IRP were increased by
$13.8 million annually beginning in July 2009.

On April 30, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO to defer pension and
other postretirement benefits expenses above those currently subject to collection in rates,
effective January 1, 2009. On July 8, 2009, the PUCO issued an Order approving Columbia of Ohio’s
application, although the deferred balances will not accrue carrying charges and Columbia of Ohio
may not seek recovery of pension and other postretirement benefits deferrals in a base rate
proceeding for a period of five years. The amount deferred was approximately $13 million in 2009.

On January 28, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC,
seeking an increase of approximately $32 million annually. The company anticipates a final order
will be received and new rates will go into effect in the fourth quarter of 2010.

On April 16, 2009, Bay State filed a base rate case with the Massachusetts DPU, requesting an
annual increase of $34.2 million. In its initial filing, Bay State sought revenue decoupling, as
well a mechanism for the recovery of costs associated with the replacement of the company’s
infrastructure. On October 30, 2009, the Massachusetts DPU issued a decision granting the company
a $19.1 million base rate increase and approving the company’s proposed revenue decoupling
mechanism and infrastructure replacement program. New rates went into effect November 1,
2009.

On May 1, 2009, Columbia of Kentucky filed a base rate case with the Kentucky PSC, requesting an
annual increase of $11.6 million. In its initial filing, Columbia of Kentucky sought enhancements
to rate design, as well as an expedited mechanism for the recovery of costs associated with the
replacement of the company’s infrastructure. A settlement agreement with all parties was presented
in a hearing before the Kentucky PSC on September 18, 2009. The settlement agreement provided for
a base rate increase of approximately $6 million, the authorization of an increase to the monthly
customer charge, the implementation of an Accelerated Main Replacement Program rider and the
introduction of a residential energy efficiency program. On October 26, 2009, the Kentucky PSC
approved the settlement agreement as filed, with new rates taking effect on October 27, 2009.

On June 8, 2009, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a CARE
Plan for a three-year period beginning January 1, 2010. The CARE Plan included incentives for
residential and small general service customers to actively pursue conservation and energy
efficiency measures, a surcharge designed to recover the costs of such measures on a real-time
basis, and a performance-based incentive for the delivery of conservation and energy efficiency
benefits. The CARE Plan also included a rate decoupling mechanism designed to mitigate the impact
of declining customer usage. On October 28, 2009, Columbia of Virginia and other parties to the
proceeding presented a unanimous settlement to the Hearing Examiner, which provided for approval of
the CARE Plan Application with modifications. The settlement was approved by the VSCC on December
4, 2009, with mechanisms becoming effective January 1, 2010.

On October 1, 2008, Columbia of Maryland filed a base rate case with the Maryland PSC. On February
20, 2009, Columbia of Maryland and all interested parties filed a unanimous settlement in the case,
recommending an annual revenue increase of $1.2 million. On March 27, 2009, the settlement was
approved as filed.

On January 28, 2010, Columbia of Maryland filed a base rate case with the Maryland PSC, seeking an
increase of approximately $2 million annually. The company anticipates a final order will be
received and new rates will go into effect in the second quarter of 2010.

Refer to the “Results and Discussion of Segment Operations” for a complete discussion of regulatory
matters.

Bear Garden Station.

Columbia of Virginia has entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia
Power to install facilities to serve a 585 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham
County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project requires approximately 13.3 miles of
24-inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC
approved Dominion Virginia Power Company’s planned Bear Garden station with an anticipated
in-service date of September 1, 2010.

Commercial Growth and Expansion of the Gas Transmission and Storage Business

Millennium Pipeline Project.

The Millennium partnership is currently owned by Columbia Transmission
(47.5%), DTE Millennium Company (26.25%), and National Grid Millennium LLC (26.25%) with Columbia
Transmission acting as operator. The Millennium pipeline was substantially completed in the fourth
quarter of 2008 and the pipeline commenced service on December 22, 2008, with the capability to
transport up to 525,400 Dth per day of natural gas to markets along its route, as well as to the
New York City market through its pipeline interconnections. Construction restoration was completed
in the third quarter of 2009.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

On August 29, 2007, Millennium entered into a bank credit agreement to finance the construction of
the Millennium pipeline project. As a condition precedent to the credit agreement, NiSource issued
a guarantee securing payment for its indirect ownership interest percentage of amounts borrowed
under the financing agreement up until such time as the amounts payable under the agreement are
paid in full. The permanent financing for Millennium is expected to be completed during 2010. As
of December 31, 2009, Millennium owed $798.9 million under the interim bank credit agreement, which
extends through August 2010. NiSource contributed $26.4 million to Millennium and received $2.8
million in distributions from Millennium for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. Additional
information on this guarantee is provided in Note 20-A, “Guarantees and Indemnities,” in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Hardy Storage Project.

Hardy Storage is a joint venture of subsidiaries of Columbia Transmission
and Piedmont. All three phases of Hardy Storage are in service, receiving customer injections and
withdrawing natural gas from its new underground natural gas storage facility in West Virginia.
Hardy Storage has a working storage capacity of 12 Bcf and the ability to deliver 176,000 Dth of
natural gas per day.

Line 1570 Project.

In October 2008, Columbia Transmission entered into a Precedent Agreement to
gather and transport phased-in volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day of gas in the Waynesburg, PA
area along Line 1570. The first two phases of this project were available for service in October
2008 and March 2009. Facilities were substantially completed in fourth quarter of 2009, allowing
for incremental volumes to be delivered. Additional volumes are expected to be phased in during
2010.

Columbia Penn Project

. In September 2008, Columbia Transmission announced its intention to develop
additional natural gas transmission, gathering and processing services along and around its
existing pipeline corridor between Waynesburg, PA and Renovo, PA, referred to as the “Columbia
Penn” corridor. This two-phase development will provide access to pipeline capacity in
conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation which underlies Columbia
Transmission’s transmission and storage network in the region. Phase I was placed into service in
February 2009 and Phase II was placed into service in November 2009.

Appalachian Expansion Project.

On August 22, 2008, the FERC issued an order to Columbia
Transmission, which granted a certificate to construct the project. The project included building
a new 9,470 hp compressor station in West Virginia. The Appalachian Expansion Project added
100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity and is fully subscribed on a 15-year contracted firm
basis. Construction is complete and the project was placed in service on July 1, 2009.

Eastern Market Expansion Project.

On January 14, 2008, the FERC issued an order which granted a
certificate to construct the project. The project allows Columbia Transmission to expand its
facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain
existing facilities. The Eastern Market Expansion added 97,000 Dth per day of storage and
transportation deliverability and is fully subscribed on a 15-year contracted firm basis.
Construction of the facilities is complete and was placed in service April 1, 2009.

Ohio Storage Project.

On June 24, 2008, Columbia Transmission filed an application before the FERC
for approval to expand two of its Ohio storage fields for additional capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and
103,400 Dth per day of deliverability. Approval was granted in March 2009 and construction of the
facilities began in April 2009. Partial service related to this expansion was available beginning
May 2009 and the expansion was placed in full service during the fourth quarter of 2009. The
expansion capacity is 58% contracted on a long-term, firm basis, with the FERC authorized
market-based rates for these and any future services.

Easton Compressor Station Project.

On March 30, 2009, Columbia Transmission announced a binding
open season for capacity into premium East Coast markets resulting from modifications made to the
company’s Easton Compressor Station. The modifications increase delivery capacity from the Wagoner
interconnection point between the Columbia Transmission and Millennium pipeline systems. Through
the open season, which closed on April 3, 2009, Columbia Transmission received 30,000 Dth per day
of binding bids. Construction began and was completed and service commenced in the fourth quarter
of 2009.

Cobb Compressor Station Project.

This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations segment strategy to meet producers’ near-term, incremental transportation demand in the
Appalachian Basin. Shippers have

NiSource Inc.

also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long-term
firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in
Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion is expected to be in service by May 2010.

Majorsville, PA Project.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is in the process of
executing three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA
vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Precedent
Agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009. On January 20, 2010,
Columbia Transmission filed with the FERC an application to transfer certain pipeline facilities to
a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream, LLC that, once approved, will be part of the
facilities providing non-FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA
vicinity. The Majorsville, PA project is expected to be in service by the end of the third quarter
2010.

Financial Management of the Balance Sheet

NiSource remains committed to maintaining its liquidity position through management of capital
spending, working capital and operational requirements, and its financing needs. NiSource has been
closely monitoring developments relative to the conditions in the financial markets and has
executed on its plan to effectively manage through this period by taking the following actions:

NiSource’s liquidity position was significantly strengthened during the third quarter as the result
of a change in tax method regarding certain electric and gas utility repair costs. Under the new
tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million
in the third quarter of 2009. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received, with
additional refunds of $25.3 million received in December 2009 and January and February 2010. The
balance of the refunds is expected to be received before the end of the second quarter 2010.

Credit Ratings.

On December 15, 2009, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at
BBB-, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitch’s outlook for NiSource and all of
its subsidiaries is stable. On


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

NiSource Inc.

November 24, 2009, Moody’s Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at
Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries, and revised the outlook to stable from
negative. On March 5, 2009, Standard and Poor’s affirmed its senior unsecured ratings for
NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB-, and revised the outlook to stable from negative. Although
all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s or Fitch
would result in a rating that is below investment grade.

Process and Expense Management

During the first quarter of 2009, NiSource began an organizational restructuring initiative,
beginning with Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, in response to the decline in overall
economic conditions.

In February 2009, NiSource announced the restructuring of the Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations segment. NiSource has eliminated positions across the 16 state operating territory of
Gas Transmission and Storage. The reductions have occurred through voluntary programs and
involuntary separations. In addition to employee reductions, the Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations segment took steps to achieve additional cost savings by efficiently managing its
various business locations, reducing its fleet operations, creating alliances with third party
service providers, and implementing other changes in line with its strategic plan for growth and
maximizing value of existing assets. During 2009, NiSource recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge
related to this initiative, net of adjustments, of $19.9 million to “Operation and maintenance”
expense on the Statement of Consolidated Income, which primarily includes costs related to
severance and other employee related costs. As of December 31, 2009,
309 employees had been terminated from employment.

In September 2009, NiSource announced the restructuring of Northern Indiana, which aims to redefine
business and operations strategies and achieve cost reductions, and impacts both Electric
Operations and Gas Distribution Operations. During 2009, NiSource recorded a pre-tax restructuring
charge related to this initiative, net of adjustments, of $5.4 million to “Operation and
maintenance” expense on the Statement of Consolidated Income, which primarily includes costs
related to severance and other employee related costs for approximately 43 employees and outside
services costs. As of December 31, 2009, 36 employees had been terminated from employment.

In the second quarter of 2009, Northern Indiana and representatives of the United Steelworkers
union reached five-year collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 1,900 Northern
Indiana employees. The parties’ new labor agreements are scheduled to expire May 31, 2014.

Ethics and Controls

NiSource has had a long term commitment to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as
well as high standards for ethical behavior by its employees. NiSource’s senior management takes
an active role in the development of this Form 10-K and the monitoring of the company’s internal
control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue its mandatory ethics
training program in which employees at every level throughout the organization participate.

Refer to “Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting” included in Item 9A.

Results of Operations

The following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies
applied by NiSource and discussed in “Other Information” of this Item 7.

Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, NiSource reported income from continuing operations
of $231.2 million, or $0.84 per basic share, compared to $370.6 million, or $1.35 per basic share
in 2008. Income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 was
$303.0 million, or $1.10 per basic share.

Including results from discontinued operations, NiSource reported 2009 net income of $217.7
million, or $0.79 per basic share, 2008 net income of $79.0 million, or $0.29 per basic share, and
2007 net income of $321.4 million, or $1.17 per basic share.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow
for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. Therefore, increases in
these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no
impact on income from continuing operations. An increase in operating expenses of $16.3 million
for the 2009 year was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of
these tracked costs. In the 2008 period, an increase in operating expenses of $17.5 million for
trackers was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs.
These increases in 2009 and in 2008 were largely attributable to higher uncollectible accounts.

Net Revenues

NiSource analyzes the operating results using net revenues. Net revenues are calculated as revenues
less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization.) NiSource believes net
revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the
majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer
resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues.

Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, were $3,331.4
million, an $85.7 million increase compared with 2008. Net revenues increased primarily due to
increased Gas Distribution Operations’ net revenues of $66.7 million and increased Gas Transmission
and Storage Operations’ net revenues of $65.4 million, partially offset by lower Electric
Operations’ net revenues of $41.0 million. Gas Distribution Operations’ net revenues were higher
due to increased revenues of $97.2 million from regulatory initiatives including impacts from rate
proceedings, partially offset by decreased residential and industrial customer usage of $22.0
million, a $13.0 million decrease in off-system sales and the impact of warmer weather of
approximately $8 million. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, net revenues increased
due to increases in firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million, shorter-term transportation
and storage services of $18.6 million and mineral rights leasing of $12.2 million. The increase in
firm capacity reservation fees was the result of growth projects such as the Eastern Market
Expansion, the Ohio Storage Expansion and new Appalachian supply contracts. Electric
Operations’ net revenues decreased due to the impact of cooler weather of approximately $18
million, lower industrial usage of $17.4 million, which was significantly impacted by economic
conditions, lower capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, $9.1
million of lower off-system sales and $9.5 million lower emission allowance sales, partially offset
by increased residential and commercial usage of $12.4 million and lower non-recoverable purchased
power of $10.1 million. The major steel company customers operated at full capacity for the first
half of 2008. Production decreased sharply in October 2008, bottoming near 50% in May 2009. Since
then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers.

Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 were $3,245.7
million, a $59.3 million increase compared with 2007. The increase in net revenues is from higher
Gas Distribution Operations net revenue which increased by $64.1 million. This increase in net
revenues was due primarily to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate
proceedings at Columbia of Pennsylvania, Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Kentucky and Bay State of
$21.9 million, increased trackers of $17.5 million offset in expense, the impact of an adjustment
for estimated unbilled revenues of $14.6 million recorded by Northern Indiana in 2007, and colder
weather of approximately $9 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues
decreased $2.1 million mainly due to lower shorter-term transportation and storage services and
commodity margin revenues of $24.0 million and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0
million, partially offset by increased subscriptions for firm transportation services of $23.1
million related to new interconnects along the Columbia Gulf pipeline system, deliveries from the
Hardy Storage field and incremental demand revenues on the Columbia Transmission system. Electric
Operations net revenues decreased $5.7 million from 2007 a result of lower residential sales
volumes and lower residential and commercial margins of $19.5 million, lower wholesale transactions
of $14.1 million, the impact of cooler weather of approximately $12 million and $11.4 million of
higher MISO related costs, partially offset by the impact of a $33.5 million settlement in third
quarter of 2007 related to the cost of power purchased by Northern Indiana in 2006 and 2007 and the
impact of a $10.9 million adjustment for estimated unbilled electric revenues recorded in 2007.
Other Operations net revenues were essentially flat compared with 2007.

NiSource Inc.

Expenses

Operating expenses were $2,545.5 million in 2009, an increase of $206.2 million from the comparable
2008 period. This increase was mainly due to higher employee and administrative expenses of $102.3
million, which primarily resulted from higher pension expense of $84.8 million, net of deferring
$10.7 million of pension costs under the regulatory order that was granted to Columbia of Ohio in
July 2009, and higher payroll and benefits expense of $29.6 million. Operating expenses also
increased as a result of restructuring charges of $27.2 million, impairment charges of $22.8
million in 2009, higher depreciation of $22.0 million, $21.6 million in increased legal reserves,
and increased trackers of $16.3 million offset in net revenues. The increase in benefits expense
is due in part to a $12.7 million adjustment that decreased expense in the third quarter of 2008,
which resulted from the misclassification of certain claims in 2007.

Operating expenses were $2,339.3 million in 2008, an increase of $60.1 million from the comparable
2007 period. This increase was primarily due to higher employee and administrative expenses of
$37.5 million, a $27.0 million increase in depreciation which includes an $8.3 million depreciation
expense adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008 and $6.6 million
of depreciation for the new Sugar Creek plant, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses
of $11.6 million and higher gross receipts and other taxes of $9.2 million. These increases in
expense were partially offset by an adjustment decreasing employee benefits expense by $12.7
million and lower legal reserves of $10.7 million. The $12.7 million adjustment decreasing
employee benefit expenses was due to a misclassification in 2007 of certain medical claims. This
adjustment had no impact on actual medical claims paid or coverage to benefit participants. The
higher generation and maintenance expenses were primarily attributable to planned turbine and
boiler maintenance and a generator overhaul, as well as $4.1 million in incremental costs
associated with the Sugar Creek facility.

Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates

Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $16.0 million in 2009, an increase of $3.7
million over 2008. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium
and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business.
Equity earnings from Millennium, which was placed into service on December 22, 2008, totaled $12.1
million for 2009, net of an $8.1 million reduction resulting from interest rate hedges relating to
Millennium’s decision to delay permanent financing until 2010.

Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $12.3 million in 2008 compared to $9.4 million in
2007. Equity earnings increased $2.9 million due to higher AFUDC earnings from Millennium
partially offset by increased interest expense from Hardy Storage.

Other Income (Deductions)

Other Income (Deductions) in 2009 reduced income $404.9 million compared to a reduction of $362.1
million in 2008. Interest expense increased by $19.3 million primarily due to incremental interest
expense associated with the issuance of $700 million of long-term debt in May 2008, the issuance of
$600 million of long-term debt in March 2009 and a $385 million two-year term loan entered into in
April 2009, partially offset by the open market repurchase of $100 million of long-term debt in
January 2009, the $250.6 million tender offer repurchase of long-term debt in April 2009 and lower
short-term interest rates. Other, net was a loss of $1.4 million compared to income of $17.6
million for 2008 primarily due to the sale of an investment in 2008 at a gain and lower interest
income in 2009. On August 27, 2008, NiSource Development Company sold its interest in JOF
Transportation Company to Lehigh Service Corporation for a pre-tax gain of $16.7 million. JOF
Transportation Company held a 40% interest in Chicago South Shore & South Bend Railroad Co. and a
40% interest in Indiana Illinois Development Company, LLC.

Other Income (Deductions) in 2008 reduced income $362.1 million compared to a reduction of $449.0
million in 2007. This decrease in other deductions of $86.9 million was mainly due to lower
interest expense, higher other income and a redemption premium of $40.6 million which reduced
income in 2007 related to the early extinguishment of long-term notes for Whiting Clean Energy.
Interest expense, net was $379.7 million for 2008 compared to $401.9 million for 2007. This
decrease of $22.2 million was mainly due to lower short-term interest rates and credit facility
fees, and the retirement late in 2007 of high cost debt associated with the Whiting Clean Energy
facility. Other, net was income of $17.6 million for 2008 compared to a loss of $6.5 million for
the comparable 2007 period due to the sale of an investment at a gain and lower costs associated
with the sale of

accounts receivable. On August 27, 2008, NiSource Development Company sold its interest in JOF
Transportation Company to Lehigh Service Corporation for a pre-tax gain of $16.7 million. The
other deduction in 2007 was due to a redemption premium of $40.6 million related to the early
extinguishment of long-term notes for Whiting Clean Energy.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates were 41.8%, 33.4%, and 35.2% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
The 8.4% increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2009 versus 2008 was the result of certain
nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million, additional deferred income tax
expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes, and a
reduction in AFUDC-Equity that increased tax expense by $3.2 million. In addition, the effective
tax rate for 2008 was reduced by $14.9 million for the change in Massachusetts state taxes
discussed below. The 1.8% decrease in the overall effective tax rate in 2008 versus 2007 was
primarily the result of the change in Massachusetts state taxes.

During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax
method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and
state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method,
NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009,
$263.5 million of these refunds were received, with additional refunds of $25.3 million received in
December 2009 and January and February 2010. The balance of the refunds is expected to be received
by the end of the second quarter of 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million
of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The
impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge
to state income tax expense of $5.5 million.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Governor of Massachusetts signed into law a bill that
significantly changed the Massachusetts corporate income tax regime. Under the new law, which
became effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, NiSource calculates its
Massachusetts income tax liability on a unitary basis, meaning that the income tax obligation to
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is determined based on an apportioned share of all of NiSource’s
income, rather than just the income of NiSource’s subsidiaries doing business in Massachusetts.
Because of NiSource’s substantial operations outside of Massachusetts, the new law had the impact
of reducing the deferred income tax liability to Massachusetts. NiSource recognized the impact of
this tax law change as a $14.9 million reduction in income tax expense in 2008. Income tax expense for 2009 reflects the impact of the new law on a prospective basis.

Discontinued Operations

Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $13.5 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009,
a loss of $291.6 million, or $1.06 loss per basic share, in 2008, and income of $18.4 million, or
$0.07 per basic share, in 2007.

The loss in 2009 includes activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where
NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges associated with
certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties.

The loss in 2008 is primarily attributable to an adjustment to the reserve for the Tawney
litigation and losses from businesses disposed during the year. During 2008 NiSource recorded an
after-tax loss of $108.2 million for the dispositions of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and
Whiting Clean Energy. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations
of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy as discontinued operations. As
such, net income of $4.4 million and $9.0 million was classified as discontinued operations for the
years ended 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Discontinued operations reflected income of $18.4 million, or $0.07 per basic share, in 2007. The
$18.4 million of income from discontinued operations in 2007 includes net income from Northern
Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy of $9.0 million, a $7.5 million
reduction, net of taxes, in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and $0.9 million in
related interest, net of taxes, associated with the issuance of additional tax guidance in the
first quarter of 2007.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

A significant portion of NiSource’s operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas
transportation and electric distribution businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash
flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts
from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer
months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business
during the summer cooling season and external short-term and long-term financing, is used to
purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of
facilities.

Operating Activities

Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was $1,666.2
million, an increase of $1,080.9 million from a year ago. During 2009, gas prices dropped
dramatically resulting in a $324.4 million over-recovery of gas cost, while during 2008 gas prices
increased resulting in only a $3.6 million over-recovery of gas costs. This same gas pricing
scenario resulted in an increase in working capital for collection of accounts receivables. During
2009, collection of accounts receivable generated a source of working capital totaling $258.9
million compared to a $202.4 million use of working capital in 2008. Net withdrawals of gas
inventory in 2009 generated a source of working capital amounting to $128.7 million compared to net
injections in 2008 and an $82.4 million use of working capital.

Income Tax Refunds

. In the third quarter of 2009, NiSource filed its consolidated federal income
tax return reflecting a significant tax loss primarily due to its change in method of accounting
related to capitalizing certain costs. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded
federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million, with additional refunds of $25.3
million received in December 2009 and January and February 2010. The balance of the refunds is
expected to be received before the end of the second quarter of 2010.

Tawney Settlement.

NiSource’s share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. The
Trial Court entered its Order discharging the judgment on January 20, 2009 and is supervising the
administration of the settlement proceeds. As of December 31, 2009, NiSource has contributed a
total of $277.3 million into the qualified settlement fund, $25 million of which was contributed in
2008. As of December 31, 2009, $61.5 million of the maximum settlement liability has not been
paid. The remaining balance of the letter of credit is sufficient to cover any remaining payments
under the Settlement Agreement. NiSource has since contributed
approximately an additional $18.0 million. NiSource will be required to make additional payments, pursuant to the settlement, upon
notice from the Class Administrator. Refer to Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” for additional
information.

Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding.

In 2009, NiSource contributed $103.0 million to its
pension plans and $60.8 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2010, NiSource
expects to make contributions of approximately $161.0 million to its pension plans and
approximately $49.1 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2009,
NiSource’s pension and other post-retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $674.5 million and
$444.7 million, respectively.

Investing Activities

As part of its efforts to strengthen its balance sheet and focus on its core regulated assets,
NiSource took a number of steps in 2008 to divest certain non-strategic assets. These included:

•

The completion of the sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corp.
for $209.1 million, including working capital.

•

The sale of the Whiting Clean Energy facility to BPAE for $216.7 million, including
working capital.

•

The disposition of certain non-strategic Columbia Gulf assets in the Gulf of Mexico
area.

Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities.

The tables below reflect actual capital
expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2007, 2008 and 2009, and estimates for
2010. The other investing activities related to equity investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage
are included within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations.

For 2009, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $798.6 million, a
decrease of $508.0 million versus 2008. A significant amount of the decrease was due to lower
capital expenditures within Electric Operations of $389.8 million, due to increased 2008 capital
expenditures for the purchase of Sugar Creek.

Capital expenditures decreased within Gas Distribution Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations by $26.5 million and $96.4 million, respectively. The decrease within Gas Distribution
Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on maintenance activities. The decrease
within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures
on growth projects relative to 2008.

For 2010 the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be
$900.4 million, which is $101.8 million higher than the 2009 capital program. This increased
spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the
Gas Distribution segment and increased maintenance expenditures in the Electric Operations segment.
The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations and short
term debt.

In 2008, NiSource received proceeds from the sale of Whiting Clean Energy, Northern Utilities, and
Granite State of $216.7 million, $187.3 million, and $14.3 million, respectively. Since these
businesses were reported as discontinued operations, these amounts are included within, “Net
Investing Activities from Discontinued Operations,” on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.

On
May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for
approximately $330 million to address the need for additional
capacity. Refer to Note 5, “Property, Plant and Equipment,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for further discussion.

Restricted cash was $174.7 million and $286.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was due primarily to the change in forward gas
prices which resulted in decreased margin deposits on open derivative contracts used within
NiSource’s risk management and energy marketing activities.

NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $62.7 million, $46.7 million, and $17.4
million related to hurricanes and other items in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Financing Activities

Long-term Debt.

During 2009, NiSource successfully executed its 2009 financing and liquidity plan
through the following activities:

•

On December 4, 2009, NiSource Finance issued $500.0 million of 6.125% senior unsecured
notes that mature March 1, 2022.

•

During November 2009, NiSource Finance redeemed $417.6 million of its floating rate
notes.

•

On April 9, 2009, NiSource Finance announced the final closing of a $385 million senior
unsecured two-year bank term loan with a maturity of February 11, 2011. Borrowings under
the bank term loan had an effective cost of LIBOR plus 538 basis points. On February 16,
2009, NiSource announced the initial closing of the bank term loan at the level of $265
million. Under an accordion feature, NiSource was able

NiSource Inc.

to increase the loan by $120
million prior to final closing. On December 7, 2009, this term loan was repaid with
proceeds from the December 4, 2009, $500.0 million debt offering.

•

On March 31, 2009, NiSource Finance announced that it was commencing a cash tender offer
for up to $300 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 7.875% notes due 2010.
On April 28, 2009, NiSource Finance announced that $250.6 million of these notes were
successfully tendered.

•

On March 9, 2009, NiSource Finance issued $600.0 million of 10.75% unsecured notes that
mature March 15, 2016.

•

During January 2009, NiSource repurchased $32.4 million of the $450.0 million floating
rate notes scheduled to mature in November 2009 and $67.6 million of the $1.0 billion
7.875% unsecured notes scheduled to mature in November 2010.

During August 2008, after a series of negative events in the tax-exempt auction rate market,
Northern Indiana converted its Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds, having a total principal
value of $254 million, from variable rate demand mode to fixed rate demand mode. The weighted
average interest rate is now fixed at 5.58%.

During July 2008, Northern Indiana redeemed $24.0 million of its medium-term notes, with an average
interest rate of 6.80%.

On May 15, 2008, NiSource Finance issued $500.0 million of 6.80% unsecured notes that mature
January 15, 2019 and $200.0 million of 6.15% unsecured notes that mature on March 1, 2013. The
notes due in 2013 constitute a further issuance of the $345.0 million 6.15% notes issued February
19, 2003, and form a single series having an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $545.0
million.

Credit Facilities.

NiSource Finance maintains a $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility
with a syndicate of banks which has a termination date of July 7, 2011. This facility provides a
reasonable cushion of short-term liquidity for general corporate purposes including meeting cash
requirements driven by volatility in natural gas prices, as well as provides for the issuance of
letters of credit. During September 2008, NiSource Finance entered into an additional $500 million
six-month revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital that was
originally due to expire on March 23, 2009. However, on February 13, 2009, the six-month credit
facility was terminated in conjunction with the closing of a new two-year bank term loan. The two
year term loan was subsequently repaid in December 2009 with proceeds from the December 4, 2009,
$500.0 million debt offering.

NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $103.0 million at December 31, 2009,
at a weighted average interest rate of 0.59%, and borrowings of $1,163.5 million at December 31,
2008, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.09%.

As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, NiSource Finance had $87.8 million and $87.3 million
of stand-by letters of credit outstanding, respectively. A letter of credit of $254 million was
issued on January 13, 2009 to cover payments related to the Tawney settlement, of which $67.1
million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2009.

As of December 31, 2009, an aggregate of $1,312.0 million of credit was available under the credit
facility.

Debt Covenants.

NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five-year revolving credit
facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not
exceed 70%. A similar covenant in the 2005 private placement requires NiSource to maintain a debt
to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2009, the ratio was 58.3%.

NiSource is also subject to certain other non-financial covenants under the revolving credit
facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on
NiSource’s assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests,
preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset
sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and/or transfer of NiSource’s assets to no more
than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the
fair

market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource
Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all
other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility
also include a cross-default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit
facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any
of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more.

NiSource’s indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However,
NiSource’s indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured
payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on
NiSource’s assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests,
preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSource’s
consolidated net tangible assets.

Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables.

On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to
sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originated, to CORC, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, was party to an agreement with
Dresdner Bank AG, also dated May 14, 2004, under the terms of which it sold an undivided percentage
ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. On October 1, 2009,
CORC and Commerzbank AG (successor to Dresdner Bank AG) terminated their agreement, while Columbia
of Ohio and CORC concurrently terminated their agreement. In conjunction with the termination of
the sales agreement on October 1, 2009, Columbia of Ohio made a payment of $67.8 million to
Commerzbank AG in exchange for rights in the receivables held by Commerzbank AG.

On October 23, 2009, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse,
substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CGORC, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Columbia of Ohio. CGORC, in turn, is party to an agreement with BTMU, also dated October 23,
2009, under the terms of which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in its accounts
receivable to a commercial paper conduit sponsored by BTMU. The maximum seasonal program limit
under the terms of the agreement is $275 million. CGORC’s agreement with the commercial paper
conduit has a scheduled termination date of October 22, 2010, and can be renewed if mutually agreed
to by both parties. As of December 31, 2009, $88.4 million of accounts receivable had been sold by
CGORC. CGORC is a separate corporate entity from NiSource and Columbia of Ohio, with its own
separate obligations, and upon a liquidation of CGORC, CGORC’s obligations must be satisfied out of
CGORC’s assets prior to any value becoming available to CGORC’s stockholder. Under the agreement,
it is an event of termination if NiSource’s debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard and Poor’s
or Moody’s or falls below BB- or Ba3 at either Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s, respectively.

On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of
its trade receivables, as they originated, to NRC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana.
NRC, in turn, was party to an agreement with Citibank, N.A. under the terms of which it sold an
undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit.
On May 20, 2009, NRC and Citibank, North America, Inc. terminated their agreement while Northern
Indiana and NRC concurrently terminated their agreement. In conjunction with the termination of
the sales agreement on May 20, 2009, Northern Indiana made a payment of $65.3 million to Citibank,
N.A. in exchange for rights in the receivables held by Citibank, N.A.

On October 23, 2009, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse,
substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NARC, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Northern Indiana. NARC, in turn, is party to an agreement with RBS, also dated October 23,
2009, under the terms of which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in its accounts
receivable to a commercial paper conduit sponsored by RBS. The maximum seasonal program limit
under the terms of the agreement is $200 million. NARC’s agreement with the commercial paper
conduit has a scheduled termination date of October 22, 2010, and can be renewed if mutually agreed
to by both parties. As of December 31, 2009, $100.0 million of accounts receivable had been sold
by NARC. NARC is a separate corporate entity from NiSource and Northern Indiana, with its own
separate obligations, and upon a liquidation of NARC, NARC’s obligations must be satisfied out of
NARC’s assets prior to any value becoming available to NARC’s stockholder. Under the agreement, it
is an event of termination if Northern Indiana’s debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard and
Poor’s or Moody’s or falls below BB, or Ba2 at either Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s, respectively.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a petition with the Pennsylvania PUC
to add an accounts receivable securitization facility. The capacity of this facility is expected
to be $75 million. The petition was approved February 25, 2010.

NiSource’s accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting based upon the conditions met
in ASC Topic 860 — Transfers and Servicing. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been
isolated from the originator and put presumptively beyond the reach of the originator and its
creditors. The originators do not retain any interest in the sold receivables.

All accounts receivables sold to the commercial paper conduits are valued at face value, which
approximate fair value due to its short-term nature. The amount of the undivided percentage
ownership interest in the accounts receivables sold is determined in part by required loss reserves
under the agreements.

Beginning January 1, 2010, transfers of accounts receivable that previously qualified for sales
accounting will be recorded as short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
maximum amount of short-term borrowings that could be recorded related to NiSource’s accounts
receivable programs is $475 million. Refer to Note 2, “Recent Accounting Pronouncements,” for
additional information.

Credit Ratings.

On December 15, 2009, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at
BBB-, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitch’s outlook for NiSource and all of
its subsidiaries is stable. On November 24, 2009, Moody’s Investors Service affirmed the senior
unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries, and
revised the outlook to stable from negative. On March 5, 2009, Standard and Poor’s affirmed its
senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB-, and revised the outlook to
stable from negative. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by
Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade.

Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased
collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB- by
Standard and Poor’s or Baa3 by Moody’s. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and
for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the
ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $24 million. In addition to agreements with
ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse
change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and
cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indiana’s trade receivables sales program, it
is an event of termination if Northern Indiana’s debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard and
Poor’s or Moody’s or falls below BB, or Ba2 at either Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s, respectively.
Likewise, under Columbia of Ohio’s trade receivables sales program, it is an event of termination
if NiSource’s debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s or falls below BB-
or Ba3 at either Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s, respectively.

Contractual Obligations.

NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at
specified periods. The obligations include long-term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity
contracts and purchase obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM
outsourcing. The table below excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long-term debt and current interest
payments on long-term debt. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2009

NiSource Inc.

NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for the fixed-rate
debt, interest is calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable-rate
debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2009. For 2010, NiSource
projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $402 million, which
includes $390.5 million of interest payments related to its long-term debt outstanding as of
December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, NiSource also had $103.0 million in short-term borrowings
outstanding.

NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline
business software requiring equal annual payments of $5.8 million over 10 years, which began in
January 2008. This agreement is recorded as a capital lease.

NiSource’s subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical
quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of
these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices.

In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indiana’s purchase power agreements with
subsidiaries of Iberdola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These
agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind
power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind
power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of
electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the
table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than
material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required
to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to
termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in
April 2009.

NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and
storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2010 to 2045, require
NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges.

On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide
business process and support functions to NiSource. IBM has retained responsibility for
information technology operations. NiSource Corporate Services will continue to pay IBM for the
amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges
fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of
these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $505 million to IBM in
service fees over the remaining 5.5 year term. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource
for any reason (other than material breach by IBM), NiSource may be required to pay IBM a
termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBM’s un-recovered capital
investments, and IBM wind-down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending
on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination.

NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business
process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries
through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate
Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable
charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage
of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $65.1 million to Vertex
Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining 5.5 year term. Upon termination of the
agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC),
NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $13.8 million.

Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation
services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various
periods through 2013 and are included within, “Other service obligations,” in the table of
contractual commitments.

Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products
and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under
this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and


ITEM 7.

NiSource Inc.

Northern Indiana pays for the services under a
combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various
performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana
terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty-year contract period. Estimated minimum
payments for this agreement are included within, “Other service obligations,” in the table of
contractual commitments.

NiSource’s expected payments included within, “Other long-term liabilities,” in the table of
contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement
benefits plans expected to be made in 2010. Plan contributions beyond 2010 are dependent upon a
number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In
2010, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $161.0 million to its pension plans
and approximately $49.1 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12,
“Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
more information.

Not included in the table above are $5.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax
liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be
estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for more information.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court
for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSource’s
share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations
under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January
13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of
$254 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the
settlement, which has since been drawn down as settlement payments have been made. As of December
31, 2009, NiSource has contributed a total of $277.3 million into the qualified settlement fund,
$25 million of which was contributed in 2008. As of December 31, 2009, $61.5 million of the
maximum settlement liability has not been paid. The remaining balance of the letter of credit is
sufficient to cover any potential settlement amounts. NiSource has since additionally contributed
approximately $18.0 million.

NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to
long-term obligations classified as, “Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits,” on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets, other than those described above.

NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll,
sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $350
million in 2010, which are not included in the table above.

Off Balance Sheet Items

As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements
providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries.
Such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit.

NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $444.4 million of commodity-related
payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These
guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial
transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the
commodity-related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee
performance of the seller’s covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and
warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees
are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource
would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the
aforementioned guarantees is remote.

NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20-A, “Guarantees and Indemnities,” in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSource’s off
balance sheet arrangements.

Market Risk Disclosures

Risk is an inherent part of NiSource’s energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly
and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk
involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify,
assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following
principal risks that are involved in NiSource’s energy businesses: commodity market risk,
interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi-faceted process
with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment
and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSource’s senior management takes an
active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that
require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification,
assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and
complex nature of the energy business, NiSource’s risk management policies and procedures
continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification.

Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSource’s market and credit
risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from
changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level.

Commodity Price Risk

NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries’ operations involving
natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSource’s subsidiaries use derivatives,
including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative
energy trading activity.

Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSource’s rate-regulated subsidiaries
is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas
costs through the rate-making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments.
If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing
services without the benefit of the traditional rate-making process and may be more exposed to
commodity price risk. Some of NiSource’s rate-regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price
risk products to its customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage
under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products
and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.

During 2009 and 2008, zero and a loss of $0.3 million, net of taxes respectively, were recognized
in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges.
All derivatives classified as a hedge are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components
determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as a regulatory asset or liability
as appropriate. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax)
related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due
to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated
natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No amounts were reclassified in
2008. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash
flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes.
Refer to Note 9, “Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information on NiSource’s various derivative programs for managing
commodity price risk.

NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual
and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount
of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSource’s restricted cash balance, may fluctuate
significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Interest Rate Risk

NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings
under revolving credit agreements and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are
indexed to short-term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to
changes in interest rates on fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of
long-term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in
short-term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short-term interest rates of 100
basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $19.2 million and $25.0
million for the years 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource
Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six
counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being
amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an
effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively.

NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics
of its outstanding long-term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance
entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million
with six counterparties having a 6 1/2-year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based
upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6-month BBA
LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a
fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of
$110 million.

On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in
a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11-year term. NiSource Finance
will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount
based on U.S. 6-month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of
premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the
swaps on July 15, 2013.

As a result of these fixed-to-variable interest rate swap transactions, $1,050 million of NiSource
Finance’s existing long-term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates.

Credit Risk

Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSource’s business
activities. NiSource’s extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In
addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval
levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts.
Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent
of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or
counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before
the settlement date. For derivative related contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are
obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future
date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in
terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted
collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support.

As a result of the ongoing credit crisis in the financial markets, NiSource has been closely
monitoring the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap
counterparties. NiSource continues to evaluate the financial status of its banking partners
through the use of market-based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also
through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies.

The parent company of one of NiSource’s interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event
of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing
Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed-to-variable
interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The
mark-to-market close-out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was
determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

NiSource also reviewed its exposure to all other counterparties including the other interest rate
swap counterparties and concluded there was no significant risk associated with these
counterparties. NiSource will continue to closely monitor events in the credit markets, as well as
overall economic conditions in the nation and the markets it serves.

Fair Value Measurement

NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair
value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement. NiSource’s financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and
liabilities, available-for-sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation.

Exchange-traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with
cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into
these valuations. Certain non-exchange-traded derivatives are valued using broker or
over-the-counter, on-line exchanges. In such cases, these non-exchange-traded derivatives are
classified within Level 2. Non-exchange-based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and
options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value.
NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various
inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted
prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other
observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market-corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived
principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where
observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the
instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a
lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such
inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in
Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that
are not exchange-traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which
reduce exposures.

Price risk management assets also include fixed-to-floating interest-rate swaps, which are
designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable-rate debt as
a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future
outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current
fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well
as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are
based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest-rate swaps are
categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value
calculation of the interest rate swap.

Refer to Note 18, “Fair Value Disclosures,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information on NiSource’s fair value measurements.

Market Risk Measurement

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates,
indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in
losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one-day VaR at a 95%
confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The
daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.2
million, $0.5 million and zero during 2009, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the
VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management
actions to reduce portfolio risk.

Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies” included in this Item 7 and Note 1-U, “Accounting for Risk
Management and Energy Marketing Activities,” and Note 9, “Risk Management and Energy Marketing
Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSource’s
risk management.

Other Information

Critical Accounting Policies

NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below
that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSource’s results of operations
and Consolidated Balance Sheets.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.

ASC Topic 980 — Regulated Operations,
provides that rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent
with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established
are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive
environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and
credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are
deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are
included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of
regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,882.4
million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, and $1,955.3 million and $1,426.5 million at
December 31, 2008, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, “Regulatory
Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its
costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the
criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980 — Regulated Operations. In such event, a write-down
of all or a portion of NiSource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If
transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the
requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory
assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be
reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic
980 — Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980-20
— Discontinuation of Rate-Regulated Accounting. In management’s opinion, NiSource’s regulated
subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980 — Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future.

Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets require
specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of
these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for
deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to
$301.4 million at December 31, 2009. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as
regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the
extent of the unrecoverable amounts.

Accounting for Risk Management Activities.

Under ASC Topic 815 — Derivatives and Hedging, the
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the
derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each
period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory
assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize
derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the
disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in
earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of
the rate-making process, the rate-regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as
regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the
contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings
are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates.

In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the
hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness
test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout
the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded
currently in earnings.

Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate
certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is
such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the
underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange-traded natural gas futures and options
contracts and over-the-counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its
natural-gas-related businesses. NiSource had $410.9 million and $351.1 million of price risk
management assets, of which $68.2 million and $344.2 million related to hedges, at December 31,
2009 and 2008, respectively, and $360.3 million and $475.0 million of price risk management
liabilities, of which $1.5 million and $405.0 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains (losses) recorded to accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, was zero and a loss of $0.3 million at December 31, 2009
and 2008, respectively.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Pensions and Postretirement Benefits.

NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and
other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related
to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in
bringing the liabilities to present value, long-term returns on plan assets and employee longevity,
among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long-term nature of the associated
liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts
on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion
of NiSource’s pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, “Pension and Other
Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Goodwill.

NiSource’s goodwill assets at December 31, 2009 were $3,677.3 million, most of which
resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes
$13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required,
NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or
circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSource’s annual goodwill test
takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2009.
The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the
goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long-term growth rates,
discount rates and fair market values.

These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and
forward-looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third-party
valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis.
NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable;
however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to
NiSource’s discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2009 test results, a 1% change in the
discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia
Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.0 billion and $800 million,
respectively.

Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2009, an interim impairment test
could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than
expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount
rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or
if NiSource’s market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of
time. No impairment triggers were identified in the fourth quarter of 2009.

Refer to Notes 1-J and 6, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

Long-lived Asset Impairment Testing

. NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long-lived
assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic
980 — Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential
earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value could be impaired. When an asset’s carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future
cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the
asset’s fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1-K, “Long-lived Assets,” and
Note 3, “Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.

Contingencies.

A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental,
tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated.
Accounting for contingencies require significant management judgment regarding the estimated
probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and
associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and
regulations. Management’s assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of
future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates
and can have a material impact on NiSource’s results of operations and financial position. Refer
to Note 20, “Other Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.

Asset Retirement Obligations.

Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an
asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market
prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques,
using various assumptions including estimates of the


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and
credit-adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes
the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the
liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related
asset. The rate-regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for
depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer
to Note 7, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.

Revenue.

Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed
to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include
estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of
commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income
upon delivery of the commodities.

Taxes.

Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates.

Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences
where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets
or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be
recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process.
Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences
between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.

In September 2006, the FASB amended guidance to define
fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and to expand disclosures about fair
value measurements. Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in
which the reporting entity transacts. Fair value should be based on the assumptions market
participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The adoption of the amended fair value
measurements and disclosures on January 1, 2008 did not have an impact on NiSource’s balance of
retained earnings.

In February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date of fair value measurement and disclosure
guidance for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of non-financial assets and liabilities until
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The delayed guidance became effective for all
nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2009.

In October 2008, the FASB clarified the application of the guidance in a market that is not active
and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a
financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. The clarification was
effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which financial statements had not been
issued.

In April 2009, the FASB provided additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and
level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. The additional guidance
was effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, with early adoption
permitted. NiSource adopted the additional guidance on April 1, 2009.

In August 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance clarifying the measurement of the fair value
of a liability in circumstances when a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability
is not available. The guidance emphasizes that entities should maximize the use of observable
inputs in the absence of quoted prices when measuring the fair value of liabilities. This guidance
became effective on October 1, 2009.

In September 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that provides further clarification for
measuring the fair value of investments in entities that meet the FASB’s definition of an
investment company. This guidance permits a company to estimate the fair value of an investment
using the net asset value per share of the investment if the net

asset value is determined in accordance with the FASB’s guidance for investment companies as of the
company’s measurement date. This creates a practical expedient to determining a fair value estimate
and certain attributes of the investment (such as redemption restrictions) will not be considered
in measuring fair value. Additionally, companies with investments within the scope of this guidance
must disclose additional information related to the nature and risks of the investments. This
guidance is effective as of December 31, 2009 and is required to be applied prospectively.
NiSource has alternative investments that are within the scope of this guidance. However, the fair
value of the alternative investments are already determined based on the net asset values per fund.
The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Refer to Note 18, “Fair Value Disclosures,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

In April 2009, the FASB revised authoritative guidance
requiring disclosures about fair value of financial instruments of publicly traded companies as
well as annual financial statements. The guidance was effective for interim reporting periods
ending after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted. NiSource adopted the guidance on April
1, 2009. As the guidance provides only disclosure requirements, the application of this ASC topic
did not impact the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 18, “Fair Value Disclosures,”
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Business Combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB amended authoritative guidance to improve the
relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of information that a reporting entity
provides in its financial reports regarding business combinations and its effects, including
recognition of assets and liabilities, the measurement of goodwill and required disclosures. This
guidance was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
on or after December 15, 2008 and earlier adoption was prohibited. The adoption of the amendment
on January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In April 2009, the FASB addressed application issues on initial recognition and measurement,
subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from
contingencies in a business combination. The additional guidance was effective for fiscal years,
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance
to amend the manner in which entities evaluate whether consolidation is required for VIEs. The
model for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest and is the primary
beneficiary of a VIE has changed significantly under the new guidance. Previously, variable
interest holders had to determine whether they had a controlling financial interest in a VIE based
on a quantitative analysis of the expected gains and/or losses of the entity. In contrast, the new
guidance requires an enterprise with a variable interest in a VIE to qualitatively assess whether
it has a controlling financial interest in the entity, and if so, whether it is the primary
beneficiary. Furthermore, this guidance requires that companies continually evaluate VIEs for
consolidation, rather than assessing based upon the occurrence of triggering events. This revised
guidance also requires enhanced disclosures about how a company’s involvement with a VIE affects
its financial statements and exposure to risks. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on the first fiscal year that begins after
November 15, 2009 with early adoption prohibited. NiSource is currently reviewing the additional
requirements to determine the impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Transfer of Financial Assets.

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to amend
derecognition criteria guidance in ASC 860 to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness,
and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements
about a transfer of financial assets; the effects of a transfer on its financial position,
financial performance, and cash flows; and a transferor’s continuing involvement, if any, in
transferred financial assets. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning on the first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2009
with early adoption prohibited. NiSource has reviewed the accounting and additional disclosure
requirements to determine the impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. This Statement will

require transfers of accounts receivable that previously qualified for sales accounting, to be
recorded as debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets effective January 1, 2010. Refer to Note 19,
“Transfers of Financial Assets,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.

International Financial Reporting Standards

On November 14, 2008, the SEC issued a proposed IFRS “roadmap” which outlines several milestones
that need to be addressed prior to making the adoption to IFRS mandatory by U.S. filers. In 2011,
the SEC will determine whether to require mandatory adoption of IFRS for all U.S. issuers.
According to recent announcements, large accelerated filers,
including NiSource, may be required to file
IFRS financial statements in 2015.

The proposed accounting changes are complex and comprehensive and will involve converting technical
accounting and financial reporting to IFRS. In addition, converting to IFRS will involve changes
to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, information technology, tax,
treasury, legal, human resources, and contractual issues. NiSource will implement a project plan
to analyze the requirements of IFRS and the potential impact adoption would have on the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Environmental Matters

NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of
air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other
environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those
environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSource’s business and operations. Refer to
Note 20-D, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding environmental matters.

Bargaining Unit Contract

As of December 31, 2009, NiSource had 7,616 employees of whom 3,261 were subject to collective
bargaining agreements. In the second quarter of 2009, Northern Indiana and representatives of the
United Steelworkers union reached five-year collective bargaining agreements covering approximately
1,900 Northern Indiana employees. The parties’ new labor agreements are scheduled to expire May
31, 2014. Kokomo Gas reached an agreement in February 2009 to replace the collective bargaining
agreement that expired on February 15, 2009. Also, Bay State has two collective bargaining
agreements that will expire on May 15, 2010 and June 18, 2010, covering approximately 98 employees.

Competition

Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor-owned, municipal, and cooperative electric
utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas
utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong
competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas.
Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial
markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates
are primarily driven by low-cost, coal-fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas
provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts
market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane-based heating which, over time, has
comprised a declining percentage of the overall market.

Market Conditions

For 2009, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to a significant decline in
natural gas commodity prices. Spot prices for the winter of 2009-2010 have primarily been in the
$3.00 — $6.50 /Dth range compared to prices in the $5.35 — $7.10 /Dth range experienced during the
winter of 2008-2009. This decline can be attributed to the weakening demand that occurred earlier
in 2009, partially offset by a slight decline in production that occurred throughout 2009.

Entering the 2009-2010 winter season, storage levels were 373 Bcf and 243 Bcf ahead of the prior
year and 5 year average inventory levels respectively. During the summer of 2009, prices ranged
between $2.00 and $5.00/Dth which were substantially less than those prices experienced in the
summer of 2008. This can be attributed to the continued weak demand that began in late 2008.

All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state-approved recovery mechanisms that
provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as
pass-through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs
included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the
difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under-recovered or over-recovered gas
cost to be included in future customer billings.

The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non-traditional revenue sources within the
evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream
of the companies’ service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies’ service
territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The
upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution
Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity.
The on-system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the
transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The
incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the
savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its
ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these
types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and
others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice
programs. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer choice opportunities, where customers can
choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its
jurisdictions.

the capital expenditures budget from 2009 to 2010 is primarily attributable to additional spending
on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.

Bear Garden Station

Columbia of Virginia has entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install
facilities to serve a 585 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as
the Bear Garden station. The project requires approximately 13.3 miles of 24-inch steel pipeline
and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia
Power Company’s planned Bear Garden station with an anticipated in-service date of September 1,
2010.

Regulatory Matters

Significant Rate Developments.

Northern Indiana currently has plans underway for the
filing of a gas rate case, the first since 1987. The filing is expected to be made in 2010, with
new rates anticipated to be effective in early 2011.

In March 2009, Indiana Governor Daniels signed Senate Bill 423 into law giving the Indiana
Finance Authority the ability to contract, on behalf of gas customers in the state of Indiana,
with developers capable of building facilities that manufacture Substitute Natural Gas from
coal. The Indiana Finance Authority received one bid, from Indiana Gasification, by the April
9, 2009 deadline to initiate a Substitute Natural Gas plant in Southern Indiana under a 30
year contract. Current law requires that all Indiana gas utilities including Northern Indiana
will be delivering a portion of Substitute Natural Gas from this facility, once it is built.
The IURC must approve the final contract between the Indiana Finance Authority and Indiana
Gasification.

On October 21, 2009, the IURC issued an Order in the proceeding concerning Northern Indiana’s
annual gas recovery, rejecting the use of a four-year average to compute unaccounted for gas.
This Order will require Northern Indiana to refund an estimated $5.8 million to customers
based on a calculation utilizing a 1-year average of unaccounted for gas for the twelve month
periods ended July 31, 2008 and July 31, 2009. A reserve has been provided for the full
amount of the refund, which will be returned to customers beginning in March, 2010.

On December 9, 2009, Northern Indiana filed a Petition with the IURC to extend its alternative
regulatory programs that expire on May 1, 2010. On February 12, 2010, Northern Indiana, the OUCC
and gas marketers supplying gas to residential and small commercial customers filed a Joint
Stipulation and Agreement proposing an extension the programs through March 31, 2012, subject to
IURC approval.

Columbia of Ohio filed a base rate case with the PUCO on March 3, 2008 and a settlement agreement
was filed on October 24, 2008. In the base rate case, Columbia of Ohio sought recovery of
increased infrastructure replacement costs, as well as the stabilization of revenues and cost
recovery through rate design. The agreement included an annual revenue increase of $47.1 million
and also provided for recovery of costs associated with Columbia of Ohio’s infrastructure
replacement program. On December 3, 2008, the PUCO approved the settlement agreement in all
material respects and approved Columbia of Ohio’s proposed rate design, with new rates taking
effect December 3, 2008.

On January 15, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO requesting authority to
increase Columbia of Ohio’s PIPP rider rate in order to collect $82.2 million in PIPP arrearages
over a period of three years, in addition to the projected level of arrearages expected to occur
during each of the succeeding twelve-month periods. On March 3, 2009, Columbia of Ohio’s proposal
was approved and became effective.

On
January  30, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application
 with the PUCO to implement a gas supply auction. The auction will
replace Columbia’s current GCR mechanism for
 providing commodity gas supplies to its sales customers. By order dated December 2, 2009, the PUCO approved a
stipulation that resolved all issues in the case. Pursuant to the stipulation, Columbia will conduct two consecutive
one-year long standard service offer auction periods starting April
2010 and April 2011. On February 23, 2010, Columbia
 held the first standard service offer auction which resulted in a final retail price adjustment of $1.93 per mcf.
 On February 24, the PUCO issued an Entry that approved the results of the auction and directed Columbia to proceed
with the implementation of the standard service offer process.

On February 27, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application to adjust rates associated with Rider
IRP. Rider IRP recovers costs associated with the replacement of natural gas risers that are prone
to failure; maintenance, repair and replacement of customers service lines; an Accelerated Mains
Replacement Program; and installation of Automatic Meter Reading Devices. On June 2, 2009, Columbia
of Ohio filed a Joint Stipulation and Recommendation that settled all issues. On June 24, 2009, the
PUCO issued an Order approving the Stipulation. Rates associated with Rider IRP were increased by
$13.8 million annually beginning in July 2009.

On November 30, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed a notice of intent to file an application to adjust
rates associated with Rider IRP and Rider DSM. Rider DSM tracks and recovers costs associated with
Columbia of Ohio’s energy efficiency and conservation programs. On February 26, 2010, Columbia
filed an application in support of its request to adjust rates with an anticipated effective date
of May 1, 2010.

On January 28, 2008, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC
seeking recovery of costs associated with its significant capital program, as well as stabilization
of revenues through modifications to rate design. On July 2, 2008, Columbia of Pennsylvania and
all interested parties filed a unanimous settlement and on October 23, 2008, the Pennsylvania PUC
issued an Order approving the settlement as filed, increasing annual revenues by $41.5 million.
New rates went into effect October 28, 2008.

On January 28, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC,
seeking an increase of approximately $32 million annually. The company anticipates a final order
will be received and new rates will go into effect in the fourth quarter of 2010.

On October 1, 2008, Columbia of Maryland filed a base rate case with the Maryland PSC. On February
20, 2009, Columbia of Maryland and all interested parties filed a unanimous settlement in the case,
recommending an annual revenue increase of $1.2 million. On March 27, 2009, the settlement was
approved as filed.

On January 28, 2010, Columbia of Maryland filed a base rate case with the Maryland PSC, seeking an
increase of approximately $2 million annually. The company anticipates a final order will be
received and new rates will go into effect in the second quarter of 2010.

On April 16, 2009, Bay State filed a base rate case with the Massachusetts DPU, requesting an
annual increase of $34.2 million. In its initial filing, Bay State sought revenue decoupling, as
well a mechanism for the recovery of costs associated with the replacement of the company’s
infrastructure. On October 30, 2009, the Massachusetts DPU issued a decision granting the company
a $19.1 million base rate increase and approving the company’s proposed revenue decoupling
mechanism and infrastructure replacement program. New rates went into effect November 1,
2009.

On May 1, 2009, Columbia of Kentucky filed a base rate case with the Kentucky PSC, requesting an
annual increase of $11.6 million. In its initial filing, Columbia of Kentucky sought enhancements
to rate design, as well as an expedited mechanism for the recovery of costs associated with the
replacement of the company’s infrastructure. A settlement agreement with all parties was presented
in a hearing before the Kentucky PSC on September 18, 2009. The settlement agreement provided for
a base rate increase of approximately $6 million, the authorization of an increase to the monthly
customer charge, the implementation of an Accelerated Main Replacement Program rider and the
introduction of a residential energy efficiency program. On October 26, 2009, the Kentucky PSC
approved the settlement agreement as filed, with new rates taking effect on October 27, 2009.

On June 8, 2009, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a CARE
Plan for a three-year period beginning January 1, 2010. The CARE Plan included incentives for
residential and small general service customers to actively pursue conservation and energy
efficiency measures, a surcharge designed to recover the costs of such measures on a real-time
basis, and a performance-based incentive for the delivery of conservation and energy efficiency
benefits. The CARE Plan also included a rate decoupling mechanism designed to mitigate the impact
of declining customer usage. On October 28, 2009, Columbia of Virginia and other parties to the
proceeding presented a unanimous settlement to the Hearing Examiner, which provided for approval of
the CARE Plan

Application with modifications. The settlement was approved by the VSCC on December 4, 2009, with
mechanisms becoming effective January 1, 2010.

Cost Recovery and Trackers.

A significant portion of the distribution companies’ revenue is
related to the recovery of gas costs, the review and recovery of which occurs via standard
regulatory proceedings. All states require periodic review of actual gas procurement activity to
determine prudence and to permit the recovery of prudently incurred costs related to the supply of
gas for customers. NiSource distribution companies have historically been found prudent in the
procurement of gas supplies to serve customers.

Certain operating costs of the NiSource distribution companies are significant, recurring in
nature, and generally outside the control of the distribution companies. Some states allow the
recovery of such costs via cost tracking mechanisms. Such tracking mechanisms allow for
abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the distribution companies to implement charges and
recover appropriate costs. Tracking mechanisms allow for more timely recovery of such costs as
compared with more traditional cost recovery mechanisms. Examples of such mechanisms include GCR
adjustment mechanisms, tax riders, and bad debt recovery mechanisms.

Comparability of Gas Distribution Operations line item operating results is impacted by these
regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt
expenses. Increases in the expenses that are the subject of trackers result in a corresponding
increase in net revenues and therefore have essentially no impact on total operating income
results.

Certain of the NiSource distribution companies have completed rate proceedings involving
infrastructure replacement or are embarking upon regulatory initiatives to replace significant
portions of their operating systems that are nearing the end of their useful lives. Each LDC’s
approach to cost recovery may be unique, given the different laws, regulations and precedent that
exist in each jurisdiction. On February 27, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application to adjust
its Rider IRP to recover costs for risers and accelerated main replacements. On June 24, 2009, the
PUCO approved a stipulation allowing Columbia of Ohio to implement the new rider rate on July 1,
2009, resulting in an annual revenue increase of $14.2 million. On October 26, 2009, the Kentucky
PSC approved a mechanism for recovering the costs of Columbia of Kentucky’s Accelerated Main
Replacement Program. In the same Order the Kentucky PSC also approved a mechanism for the recovery
of Columbia of Kentucky’s uncollectible expenses associated with the cost of gas. On October 30,
2009, the Massachusetts DPU approved a mechanism for the recovery of costs associated with the
replacement of Bay State’s infrastructure.

On April 30, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO to defer pension and other
postretirement benefits expenses above those currently subject to collection in rates, effective
January 1, 2009. On July 8, 2009, the PUCO issued an Order approving Columbia of Ohio’s
application, although the deferred balances will not accrue carrying charges and Columbia of Ohio
may not seek recovery of pension and other postretirement benefits deferrals in a base rate
proceeding for a period of five years. The amount deferred was approximately $13 million in 2009.

Customer Usage.

The NiSource distribution companies have experienced declining usage by customers,
due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices, as well as general
economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs’ operating costs are fixed in nature.
Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion
of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. During times of
unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may
reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost or other economic conditions. Columbia of Ohio
recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a “de-coupled”
rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory
proceedings in 2009, Bay State and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms
which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each
of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the
procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory
proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of
December 31, 2009, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions.
Refer to Note 20-D, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment.

Restructuring

In September 2009 NiSource announced the restructuring of Northern Indiana which aims to redefine
business and operations strategies and achieve cost reductions. During 2009, NiSource recorded a
pre-tax restructuring charge related to this initiative, net of adjustments, of $5.4 million to
“Operation and maintenance” expense on the Statement of Consolidated Income, which primarily
includes costs related to severance and other employee related costs for approximately 43 employees
and outside services costs. Of the $5.4 million restructuring charge, net of adjustments,
approximately $1.7 million was recorded to Gas Distribution Operations. Refer to Note 3,
“Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to
Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in
working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand
customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource
began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a
net loss of $0.5 million, and net income of $6.2 million and $5.3 million from continuing
operations for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was
classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
and 2007, respectively. Refer to Note 4, “Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held
for Sale,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the company’s larger
acquisition of Bay State. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Bay State as a core component of
the company’s long-term, investment-driven growth strategy.

Weather

In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer
demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree-days. Normal is evaluated using
heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for
measuring heating degree-days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load
begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65
degrees. NiSource composite heating degree-days reported do not directly correlate to the weather
related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree-days
experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or
less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed
results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when
there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating
degree-day comparison.

Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was
about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2009 compared to 2008.

Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2008 was approximately 2% colder
than normal and 5% colder than 2007, increasing net revenues by approximately $9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007.

Throughput

Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared
to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial
customers due to warmer weather

and lower industrial usage due to the economy’s slowdown and lower off-system sales volumes
resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell
gas to non-traditional customers.

Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2008 were 923.2 MMDth, compared
to 907.3 MMDth for 2007. This increase reflected higher sales to residential and commercial
customers attributable mainly to cooler weather and higher off-system sales.

Net Revenues

Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase
in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate
cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in
expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer usage of $22.0 million,
lower off-system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately
$8 million.

Net revenues for 2008 were $1,542.7 million, an increase of $64.1 million from 2007. This increase
in net revenues was due primarily to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate
proceedings at Columbia of Pennsylvania, Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Kentucky and Bay State of
$21.9 million, the impact of an adjustment for estimated unbilled revenues of $14.6 million
recorded by Northern Indiana in 2007, increased trackers of $13.1 million offset in expense, colder
weather of approximately $9 million and increased residential usage of $4.0 million, partially
offset by reduced industrial and commercial margins and usage of $9.0 million. The $21.9 million
increase from regulatory and service programs is inclusive of a $9.3 million decrease in net
revenues associated with the implementation of the Columbia of Ohio Stipulation entered into with
the Ohio Consumers Counsel and the PUCO at the end of 2007.

At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under
and over-recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are
primarily reflected in the “Other” gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this
segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December
31, 2009 and 2008 was a revenue decrease of $121.1 million and $5.8 million, respectively,
primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years.

Operating Income

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations
segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008
primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased
net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and
administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher
uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that
are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in
employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net
of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations
segment was $336.1 million, an increase of $11.0 million compared to the same period in 2007
primarily attributable to increased net revenues described above, partially offset by higher
operating expenses of $53.1 million. The increase in operating expenses includes $13.1 million of
expenses recoverable through regulatory and tax trackers which are offset in revenues, of which
$6.6 million is for an increase in tracked tax expense. Operating expenses also increased
primarily due to higher employee and administrative costs of $21.3 million, increased maintenance
and supplies expense of $5.3 million, higher depreciation expense of $4.5 million and increased
gross receipts and other operating taxes (excluding the impact of trackers) of $4.0 million.
Employee and administrative costs increased as a result of higher payroll costs for increased
headcount, cost of living and performance adjustments, and higher corporate services costs related
to information technology and consulting.

Growth Projects Placed into Service

Millennium Pipeline Project.

The Millennium partnership is currently owned by Columbia Transmission
(47.5%), DTE Millennium Company (26.25%), and National Grid Millennium LLC (26.25%) with Columbia
Transmission acting as operator. The Millennium pipeline was substantially completed in the fourth
quarter of 2008 and the pipeline commenced service on December 22, 2008, with the capability to
transport up to 525,400 Dth per day of natural gas to markets along its route, as well as to the
New York City market through its pipeline interconnections. Construction restoration was completed
in the third quarter of 2009.

On August 29, 2007, Millennium entered into a bank credit agreement to finance the construction of
the Millennium pipeline project. As a condition precedent to the credit agreement, NiSource issued
a guarantee securing payment for its indirect ownership interest percentage of amounts borrowed
under the financing agreement up until such time as the amounts payable under the agreement are
paid in full. The permanent financing for Millennium is expected to be completed during 2010. As
of December 31, 2009, Millennium owed $798.9 million under the interim bank credit agreement, which
extends through August 2010. NiSource contributed $26.4 million to Millennium and received $2.8
million in distributions from Millennium for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. Additional
information on this guarantee is provided in Note 20-A, “Guarantees and Indemnities,” in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Hardy Storage Project.

Hardy Storage is a joint venture of subsidiaries of Columbia Transmission
and Piedmont. All three phases of Hardy Storage are in service, receiving customer injections and
withdrawing natural gas from its new underground natural gas storage facility in West Virginia.
Hardy Storage has a working storage capacity of 12 Bcf and the ability to deliver 176,000 Dth of
natural gas per day.

Line 1570 Project.

In October 2008, Columbia Transmission entered into a Precedent Agreement to
gather and transport phased-in volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day of gas in the Waynesburg, PA
area along Line 1570. The first two phases of this project were available for service in October
2008 and March 2009. Facilities were substantially completed in fourth quarter of 2009, allowing
for incremental volumes to be delivered. Additional volumes are expected to be phased in during
2010.

Columbia Penn Project

. In September 2008, Columbia Transmission announced its intention to develop
additional natural gas transmission, gathering and processing services along and around its
existing pipeline corridor between Waynesburg, PA and Renovo, PA, referred to as the “Columbia
Penn” corridor. This two-phase development will provide access to pipeline capacity in
conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation which underlies Columbia
Transmission’s transmission and storage network in the region. Phase I was placed into service in
February 2009 and Phase II was placed into service in November 2009.

Appalachian Expansion Project.

On August 22, 2008, the FERC issued an order to Columbia
Transmission, which granted a certificate to construct the project. The project included building
a new 9,470 hp compressor station in West Virginia. The Appalachian Expansion Project added
100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity and is fully subscribed on a 15-year contracted firm
basis. Construction is complete and the project was placed in service on July 1, 2009.

Eastern Market Expansion Project.

On January 14, 2008, the FERC issued an order which granted a
certificate to construct the project. The project allows Columbia Transmission to expand its
facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain
existing facilities. The Eastern Market Expansion added 97,000 Dth per day of storage and
transportation deliverability and is fully subscribed on a 15-year contracted firm basis.
Construction of the facilities is complete and was placed in service April 1, 2009.

Ohio Storage Project.

On June 24, 2008, Columbia Transmission filed an application before the FERC
for approval to expand two of its Ohio storage fields for additional capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and
103,400 Dth per day of deliverability. Approval was granted in March 2009 and construction of the
facilities began in April 2009. Partial service related to this expansion was available beginning
May 2009 and the expansion was placed in full service during the fourth quarter of 2009. The
expansion capacity is 58% contracted on a long-term, firm basis, with the FERC authorized
market-based rates for these and any future services.

Easton Compressor Station Project.

On March 30, 2009, Columbia Transmission announced a binding
open season for capacity into premium East Coast markets resulting from modifications made to the
company’s Easton Compressor Station. The modifications increase delivery capacity from the Wagoner
interconnection point between the Columbia Transmission and Millennium pipeline systems. Through
the open season, which closed on April 3, 2009, Columbia Transmission received 30,000 Dth per day
of binding bids. Construction began and was completed and service commenced in the fourth quarter
of 2009.

Growth Projects in Progress

Cobb Compressor Station Project.

This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations segment strategy to meet producers’ near-term, incremental transportation demand in the
Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately
25,500 Dth per day of long-term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at
Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion is expected to be in
service by May 2010.

Majorsville, PA Project.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is in the process of
executing three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA
vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Precedent
Agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009. On January 20, 2010,
Columbia Transmission filed with the FERC an application to transfer certain pipeline facilities to
a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream, LLC that, once approved, will be part of the
facilities providing non-FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA
vicinity. The Majorsville, PA project is expected to be in service by the end of the third quarter
2010.

Regulatory Matters

On November 9, 2009, Columbia Gulf filed an application before the FERC for approval to replace
Columbia Gulf’s existing Transportation Retainage Adjustment tracker mechanism that Columbia Gulf
currently relies upon to recover fuel with a proposed Incentive Fixed Fuel mechanism. The
Incentive Fixed Fuel would establish a fixed fuel rate and includes incentives to improve pipeline
infrastructure and reduce pipeline fuel requirements.

Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by
$96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects.
Expenditures related to maintenance projects were also lower during 2009 as well. The capital
expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 are projected to be approximately $300
million, which is an increase of $12.6 million over 2009. The increase in Maintenance and Other
from 2009 to 2010 is attributable to Integrity Management pipeline spending and a planned pipeline
replacement.

Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold

Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of
service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and
Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm
contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management
seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts.

Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between
certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a “capacity reservation” fee
based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an
incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from
firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues
are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high
percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue
fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near-term
supply and demand conditions. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, approximately 89.3%
of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm
contracts and 3.8% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm
contracts. This is compared to approximately 90.1% of the transportation revenues derived from
capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.3% of transportation revenues derived
from usage fees under firm contracts for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008.

Interruptible transportation service includes park and loan services and is typically short-term in
nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable
to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually
transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise
used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not
assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides
interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as
they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize
revenues from the gas
transmission assets. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately 6.9%
and 4.6%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts.

Hartsville and Delhi Compressor Stations

In February 2008, tornados struck Columbia Gulf’s Hartsville Compressor Station in Macon County,
Tennessee. Immediately after the tornados struck, Columbia Gulf began to construct both temporary
and permanent facilities at Hartsville. In July 2008, the station completed the installation of
temporary horsepower and restored capacity. During the fourth quarter 2009, construction of a
permanent compression solution was completed. In early January 2010, testing was completed and
permanent horsepower was placed into service. This permanent compression solution is
environmentally advantageous as it is more efficient, cleaner-burning and quieter. Replacement of
the remaining temporary facilities, which were constructed to restore system capabilities, with a
permanent solution is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2010. Columbia
Gulf incurred $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction
costs. Columbia Gulf expects to incur up to an additional $12 million in costs, dependent upon
facility abandonments, for the compressor station and ancillary facilities. Damage claims were
settled with insurance companies in 2008.

In December 2007, Columbia Gulf’s Line 100 ruptured approximately two miles north of its Delhi
Compressor Station in Louisiana. On July 1, 2008, Columbia Gulf restored full pressure and full
capacity on the Line 100 pipeline. Columbia Gulf continues to operate under a Corrective Action
Order issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration in December 2007. Costs
of $2.9 million, principally capital in nature, to repair damages on Line 100 were incurred,
predominantly in 2008.

Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incidents
totaled $45.3 million and $31.4 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of December 31, 2009,
there are no claims outstanding for these incidents.

Hurricanes

In September 2004, hurricane Ivan damaged certain Columbia Gulf property and in the third quarter
of 2005, Columbia Gulf incurred additional damages to its pipeline assets and facilities as a
result of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital
costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages
to nearly $59 million over a multi-year period, which were principally capital expenditures
recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or
when information became available to estimate the damages incurred.

Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which
$11.5 million, $16.8 million, and $8.5 million in proceeds was received in 2009, 2008, and 2007,
respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital
replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other
losses. As of December 31, 2009, there are no claims outstanding for this incident.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
segment. As of December 31, 2009, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental
response actions. Refer to Note 20-D, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations segment.

Sale of Granite State Gas

On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to
Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in
working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that
occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86-mile FERC regulated gas
transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008,
NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As
such, net income of $0.6 million and zero from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which
affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from
discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Refer to
Note 4, “Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Restructuring Plan

In February 2009, NiSource announced the restructuring of the Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations segment. NiSource has eliminated positions across the 16 state operating territory of
Gas Transmission and Storage. The reductions have occurred through voluntary programs and
involuntary separations. In addition to employee reductions, the Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations segment took steps to achieve additional cost savings by efficiently managing its
various business locations, reducing its fleet operations, creating alliances with third party
service providers, and implementing other changes in line with its strategic plan for growth and
maximizing value of existing assets. During 2009, NiSource recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge
related to this initiative, net of adjustments, of $19.9 million to “Operation and maintenance”
expense on the Statement of Consolidated Income, which primarily includes costs related to
severance and other employee related costs. As
of December 31, 2009, 309 employees had been terminated from employment. Refer to Note 3,
“Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives.

Throughput

Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers
within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid-Atlantic, midwestern, and
southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists
of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed
throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its
mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipeline’s throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its
customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment
eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment.

Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009,
compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia
Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new
Columbia Transmission contracts.

Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,488.5 MMDth for 2008,
compared to 1,618.9 MMDth in 2007. The decrease of 130.4 MMDth is due primarily to sale of most of
Columbia Gulf’s offshore assets mid-year partially offset by increased transportation deliveries on
Columbia Transmission related to growth projects. Columbia Gulf, in tandem with Columbia
Transmission, renewed several key long-term contracts during 2008.

Net Revenues

Net revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in
net revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million
principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage
Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter-term transportation
and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased
trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of
$9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract
buyouts in 2008.

Net revenues were $865.3 million for 2008, a decrease of $2.1 million from 2007. The decrease in
net revenues was mainly due to lower shorter-term transportation and storage services and commodity
margin revenues of $24.0 million, the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million and
insurance proceeds from a business interruption claim that improved last year’s results by $2.6
million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by increased subscriptions for firm
transportation services of $23.1 million related to new interconnects along the Columbia Gulf
pipeline system, deliveries from the Hardy Storage field and incremental demand revenues on the
Columbia Transmission system as well as from a $5.3 million impact from contract buyouts and a $4.4
million increase in trackers that are offset in expense.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued)

Operating Income

Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008 primarily due to
increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by
an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of
restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues,
higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher
environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset
by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity
earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia
Transmission’s investment in Millennium, net of $8.1 million in expense resulting from interest
rate hedges related to Millennium’s decision to delay permanent financing until 2010.

Operating income of $369.7 million in 2008 increased $7.7 million from 2007 primarily due to a
decrease in operating expenses of $6.9 million and higher equity earnings of $2.9 million,
partially offset by a decrease in net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased as a
result of $10.7 million in lower legal reserves, the impact of a $7.2 million impairment charge
recognized in the comparable 2007 period related to base gas at a storage field, $3.1 million in
lower insurance costs and $2.4 million of lower uncollectible accounts. These decreases in
operating expenses were partially offset by higher employee and administrative costs of $10.0
million, an $8.3 million loss on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf and $4.4
million of increased tracked expenses that are offset in revenues. Employee and administrative
costs increased as a result of higher corporate services costs related to information technology
and consulting, and increased payroll costs including cost of living and performance adjustments.
Equity earnings increased by $2.9 million due to higher AFUDC earnings associated with Millennium
partially offset by increased interest expense associated with Columbia Transmission’s investment
in Hardy Storage.

Electric Supply

On October 29, 2009, Northern Indiana filed its 2009 Integrated Resource Plan with the IURC. The
plan evaluates demand-side and supply-side resource alternatives to reliably and cost-effectively
meet Northern Indiana customers’ future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the
effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to
serve customers’ needs. Therefore, Northern Indiana’s two requests for proposals to secure
additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. With
numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near-term outlook, Northern Indiana continues
to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource
plan as appropriate.

On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indiana’s proposed purchase power
agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind-generated power from Iowa and South
Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind
power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal
renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power
purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard.

Market Conditions

Northern Indiana’s mwh sales to steel-related industries accounted for approximately 62.6% and
63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. Northern Indiana’s industrial sales volumes and revenues declined significantly in
2009 as compared to 2008, due to the dramatic changes in the world economy mid to late 2008 and
throughout 2009. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions.
Predominant factors are the ongoing economic downturn, industry consolidation, fluctuating demand,
increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. In the fourth
quarter of 2008, the industry responded to decreased steel demand by idling capacity throughout the
world and bottoming near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales
to these customers.

The Electric Operations segment’s capital expenditure program and other investing activities in
2009 were lower by $389.8 million versus 2008. The decrease in capital was primarily attributable
to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be
approximately $208.3 million in 2010, which is an increase of $45.7 million. This increase is
mainly due to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet.

Regulatory Matters

Significant Rate Developments.

On June 27, 2008, Northern Indiana filed a petition for new
electric base rates and charges. It has been more than 22 years since Northern Indiana has had an
electric base rate increase. The filing requested an increase in base rates calculated to produce
additional gross margin of $85.7 million. Several stakeholder groups have intervened in the case,
representing customer groups and various counties and towns within Northern Indiana’s electric
service territory. Evidentiary hearings concluded on August 6, 2009, and the briefing schedule
concluded in January 2010. The case is expected to be resolved with new electric rates effective
during the first half of 2010.

Northern Indiana received a favorable regulatory order on February 18, 2009 related to its actions
to increase its electric generating capacity and advance its electric rate case. Acting on a
settlement reached among Northern Indiana and its regulatory stakeholders, the IURC ruled that
Northern Indiana’s Sugar Creek electric generating plant was in service for ratemaking purposes as
of December 1, 2008. The IURC also approved the deferral of depreciation expenses and carrying
costs associated with the $330 million Sugar Creek investment. Northern Indiana purchased Sugar
Creek on May 30, 2008 and effective December 1, 2008, Sugar Creek was accepted as an internal
designated network resource within the MISO.

Northern Indiana anticipates filing another electric base rate case during 2010. Among other
things, the filing is expected to include the effect of increased pension expense, as well as
demand levels based on more recent operating experience.

Electric Operations (continued)

During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate
review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an Order adopting most aspects of the settlement.
The Order approving the settlement provides that certain electric customers of Northern Indiana
will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year. The credits will continue at
approximately the same annual level and per the same methodology, until the IURC enters a base rate
order that approves revised Northern Indiana electric rates. Credits amounting to $56.1 million,
$53.9 million and $56 million were recognized for electric customers for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

On December 9, 2009, the IURC issued an order in its generic DSM investigation proceeding
establishing an overall annual energy savings goal of 2% to be achieved by Indiana jurisdictional
electric utilities in 10 years, with interim savings goals established in years one through nine.
Northern Indiana and other jurisdictional electric utilities must file DSM plans on July 1, 2010,
2013, 2016, and 2019, with annual updates in the interim periods. The IURC requires that certain
core programs be established and administered by an independent third party. The IURC did not make
any specific findings with respect to cost recovery issues. Northern Indiana is unable to
determine or quantify the impact of the order at this time.

MISO.

As part of Northern Indiana’s participation in the MISO transmission service, wholesale
energy and ancillary service markets, certain administrative fees and non-fuel costs have been
incurred. IURC orders have been issued authorizing the deferral for consideration in a future rate
case proceeding of certain non-fuel related costs incurred after Northern Indiana’s rate
moratorium, which expired on July 31, 2006. In its base rate case, Northern Indiana proposes
recovery of the cumulative amount of net non-fuel charges that were deferred as of December 31,
2008, and to recover, through a tracker, charges deferred between December 31, 2008 and the date of
effective rates in this case. As of December 31, 2009, Northern Indiana has deferred $3.5 million
of non-fuel charges pending the outcome of the current electric rate case proceeding.

On November 7, 2008, the FERC issued an Order clarifying the RSG First Pass calculation and
requiring the MISO to resettle the RSG market using the correct calculation and to pay refunds, or
assess surcharges, to market participants, as appropriate, to correct a misinterpretation of an
order issued by FERC in April 2006. Northern Indiana believes that it would have been entitled to
a refund, with the amount subject to calculation by MISO. On June 12, 2009, however, FERC issued
an order on rehearing in which it affirmed its prior order clarifying the method to calculate the
RSG First Pass rate, but reversed its ruling requiring the MISO to pay refunds, and collect
surcharges, on equitable grounds. Northern Indiana has asked FERC to reconsider its decision to
deny refunds and that request remains pending. MISO’s implementation of FERC’s April 2006 Order on
the RSG First Pass calculation resulted in several million dollars of surcharges to Northern
Indiana through market resettlements implemented during the summer of 2007. As a result, Northern
Indiana and Ameren jointly filed a complaint with FERC on August 10, 2007, contending that the RSG
rates in effect were unjust and unreasonable. On November 10, 2008, the FERC issued an Order
granting these complaints and ordering the MISO to calculate refunds and surcharges, as
appropriate, back to the date of the complaint filed by Northern Indiana and Ameren, as authorized
by Section 206 of the Federal Power Act. On May 6, 2009, however, the FERC issued an Order that
upheld its decision granting the complaint, but largely reversed its directive requiring MISO to
pay refunds, and collect surcharges, on equitable grounds. The FERC affirmed the refund and
surcharge requirement only for those transactions that occurred after the date of the November 10,
2008 Order, instead of August 10, 2007, as it had previously required. Northern Indiana and Ameren
have requested rehearing of the FERC’s May 6, 2009 Order, and that request remains pending.

MISO and PJM Interconnection undertook a joint effort in April and May 2009 to identify a source of
unaccounted for flows on several coordinated flowgates. The analysis found that certain PJM
Interconnection generating units that were once associated with unit-specific capacity sales were
erroneously excluded from PJM Interconnection’s market flows, which significantly affected the
congestion price on reciprocally coordinated flowgates on Northern Indiana systems. Higher PJM
Interconnection market flows on congested flowgates would have resulted in higher payments to MISO
by PJM Interconnection during market to market coordination since April 1, 2005. The model was
fixed on June 18, 2009 and MISO and PJM Interconnection are currently in settlement discussions
with the FERC that began on October 19, 2009 to determine the financial impact of any
resettlements. Initial amounts calculated by PJM Interconnection approximated $78 million, while
MISO has performed a preliminary estimate of $125 to $150 million. The impact to Northern Indiana
cannot be reasonably estimated until a settlement is reached

between MISO and PJM Interconnection, and MISO receives approval from the FERC on an allocation
methodology to its market participants. Any adjustment will be neutral or favorable to operations.

Cost Recovery and Trackers.

A significant portion of Northern Indiana’s revenue is related to the
recovery of fuel costs to generate power and the fuel costs related to purchased power. These
costs are recovered through a FAC, a standard, quarterly, “summary” regulatory proceeding in
Indiana. Various intervenors, including the OUCC, had taken issue with the allocation of costs
included in Northern Indiana’s FAC-80, FAC-81 and FAC-82, which cover the reconciliation of April
— December 2008. The IURC granted a sub-docket to consider such issues in those filings. The
intervening parties and Northern Indiana discussed procedures to eliminate these concerns and to
resolve them for the historical periods. On November 4, 2009 the IURC approved a settlement
agreement which calls for a credit of $8.2 million to be provided to FAC customers beginning in
November 2009, less any amount for attorney’s fees and expenses.

On May 28, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving the purchase of Sugar Creek, and on May 30,
2008 Northern Indiana purchased the 535mw CCGT for $330 million in order to help meet capacity
needs. On February 18, 2009, the IURC issued an order approving a settlement agreement filed in
this proceeding allowing Northern Indiana to begin deferring carrying costs and depreciation,
pending inclusion in rates, on Sugar Creek effective on December 1, 2008, when Sugar Creek was
dispatched into MISO, at the agreed to carrying cost rate of 6.5%. The annual deferral for Sugar
Creek is reduced by the annual depreciation on the Mitchell plant of $4.5 million, pursuant to the
FAC-71 settlement. The terms of recovery of the deferral and inclusion of Sugar Creek in rates will
be resolved in Northern Indiana’s current rate proceeding.

As part of a settlement agreement which resolved issues surrounding purchased power costs, Northern
Indiana implemented a new “benchmarking standard,” that became effective in October 2007, which
defines the price above which purchased power costs must be absorbed by Northern Indiana and are
not permitted to be passed on to ratepayers. The benchmark is based upon the costs of power
generated by a hypothetical natural gas fired unit using gas purchased and delivered to Northern
Indiana and a set sharing mechanism. During 2009 and 2008, the amount of purchased power costs
exceeding the benchmark amounted to $1.0 million and $11.1 million, respectively, which was
recognized as a net reduction of revenues. The agreement also contemplated Northern Indiana adding
generating capacity to its existing portfolio by providing for the benchmark to be adjusted as new
capacity is added. The dispatch of Sugar Creek into MISO on December 1, 2008 triggered a change in
the benchmark, whereby the first 500 mw tier of the benchmark provision was eliminated.

Northern Indiana has approval from the IURC to recover certain environmental related costs through
an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the
capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEM’s NOx SIP and CAIR and CAMR
compliance plan projects through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation
expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Northern Indiana
anticipates a total capital investment of approximately $510 million. This revised cost estimate
is subject to and pending approval by the IURC. On October 28, 2009, the IURC approved ECR-14 for
recovery of items described above based upon a capital expenditure level (net of accumulated
depreciation) of $271.2 million.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December
31, 2009, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to
Note 20-D, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment.

Restructuring

In September 2009, NiSource announced the restructuring of Northern Indiana which aims to redefine
business and operations strategies and achieve cost reductions. During 2009, NiSource recorded a
pre-tax restructuring charge related to this initiative, net of adjustments, of $5.4 million to
“Operation and maintenance” expense on the Statement of Consolidated Income, which primarily
includes costs related to severance and other employee related costs for approximately 43 employees
and outside services costs. Of the $5.4 million restructuring charge, net of adjustments,
approximately $3.7 million was recorded to Electric Operations. Refer to Note 4, “Restructuring

Activities,” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding restructuring initiatives.

Sales

Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared
to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a
result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes
sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies’
production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen
growth in its power sales to these customers.

Electric Operations sales were 17,442.5 gwh for the year 2008, a decrease of 370.6 gwh compared to
2007, mainly resulting from lower residential sales due to cooler weather and decreased usage, as
well as from decreased industrial sales and wholesale volumes, partially offset by higher
commercial sales.

Net Revenues

Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from
2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower
industrial usage of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues
from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission
allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off-system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in
net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial usage of $12.4 million and
lower non-recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million.

Electric Operations net revenues were $805.9 million for 2008, a decrease of $5.7 million from
2007. This decrease was primarily a result of lower residential sales volumes and lower
residential and commercial margins of $19.5 million, lower wholesale transactions of $14.1 million,
the impact of cooler weather of approximately $12 million, $11.4 million of higher MISO related
costs and $8.0 million of non-recoverable purchased power. These decreases in net revenues were
partially offset by the impact of a $33.5 million settlement in third quarter of 2007 related to
the cost of power purchased in 2006 and 2007, the impact of a $10.9 million adjustment for
estimated unbilled electric revenues recorded in 2007, $6.2 million in increased industrial net
revenues and incremental revenues of $6.1 million from the new Sugar Creek facility.

At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under
and over-recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are
primarily reflected in the “Other” gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this
segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December
31, 2009 and 2008 was a revenue reduction of $20.2 million and $39.8 million, respectively.

Operating Income

Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease
in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues
described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative
costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and
maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in
operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower
environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in
employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The
decrease in depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded
by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008.

Operating income for 2008 was $219.2 million, a decrease of $42.3 million from 2007. The decrease
in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $36.6 million and lower net revenues
described above. Operating expenses increased primarily due to a $17.6 million increase in
depreciation which includes an $8.3 million depreciation expense adjustment recorded during the
second quarter of 2008, higher employee and administrative costs of $11.8 million, higher electric
generation and maintenance expenses of $7.5 million and $4.1 million of incremental costs
associated with the Sugar Creek facility, partially offset by lower property taxes of $3.9 million.
Employee and administrative costs increased as a result of higher payroll costs for increased
headcount and

In the second quarter of 2009, NiSource was pursuing the sale of its unregulated natural gas
marketing business, and results of operations and cash flows in the second and third quarter of
2009 were classified as discontinued operations for this business. However, in the fourth quarter
of 2009, an agreement was not reached for the sale of the business as was previously expected, and
a sale within the next twelve months is deemed no longer probable. As such, the results of
operations and cash flows for this unregulated natural gas marketing business are currently
reflected within continuing operations for all periods presented. Certain net assets for the
business previously classified as held for sale in June and September of 2009 are no longer
reflected as held for sale as of December 31, 2009. In addition, changes were made during the year
regarding how associated derivative contracts were being accounted for as a result of the decision
to sell this business. Refer to Note 9, “Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities,” in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

NiSource has made a decision to significantly scale back the unregulated natural gas marketing
activities. The move is part of NiSource’s long-term strategy of focusing on its core regulated
businesses. NiSource has notified its current customers of this decision.

For 2009, Other Operations gross revenues decreased due to a significant decline in natural gas
commodity prices.

Lake Erie Land Company, Inc.

Lake Erie Land, which is wholly-owned by NiSource, was in the process of selling real estate over a
10-year period as a part of an agreement reached in June 2006 with a private real estate
development group. In the second quarter of 2009, the developer was unable to meet certain
contractual obligations under the sale agreement. NiSource granted a limited extension for the
developer to meet its contractual obligations and began negotiations with another potential buyer
to replace the original developer under the existing agreement. In July 2009, NiSource signed a
letter of intent with the new potential buyer which was reaffirmed in October 2009. However, in
the fourth quarter of 2009, an agreement was not reached for the sale of the real estate as was
previously expected, and a sale within the next twelve months is deemed no longer probable. As
such, certain real estate assets previously classified as
held for sale are no longer reflected as held for sale as of December 31, 2009. An impairment loss
of $16.6 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009 to record certain Lake Erie Land assets
at fair value.

NDC Douglas Properties, Inc.

NDC Douglas Properties, a subsidiary of NiSource Development Company, is in the process of exiting
some of its low income housing investments. Five of these properties are classified as assets and
liabilities held for sale, and results of operations and cash flows for these properties are
classified as discontinued operations. Based on the expected proceeds from the sale of the five
properties being less than the net book value, an impairment charge of $2.7 million, net of tax,
was included in Loss on Disposition of Discontinued Operations in the Statements of Consolidated
Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2009. A purchase agreement was executed for the sale
of three of the properties on November 20, 2009; however, the sale is not expected to be final
until the first quarter of 2010. The other two properties are expected to sell in the second half
of 2010.

NDC Douglas Properties owns four other properties which do not currently meet the assets held for
sale criteria, as their estimated sale date is greater than one year. Based on previous
impairments recorded on other NDC Douglas Properties, the properties were tested for impairment
during the third quarter of 2009. The test resulted in an additional pre-tax impairment charge of
$4.4 million which reduced Operating Income for the year ended December 31, 2009.

PEI Holdings, Inc.

Whiting Clean Energy

. On June 30, 2008, NiSource sold Whiting Clean Energy to BPAE for $216.7
million, which included $16.1 million in working capital. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource
began accounting for the operations of Whiting Clean Energy as discontinued operations. As such, a
net loss of zero, $2.4 million, and net income of $3.7 million was included as net income or loss
from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Refer to Note 4, “Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale,” in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Other Operations segment. As of December 31,
2009, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note
20-D, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment.

Net Revenues

For the year ended 2009, net revenues were $33.0 million, an increase of $5.5 million from 2008 due
primarily to a higher commercial and industrial gas marketing revenues of $5.7 million, from
forward physical sales contracts that are recorded at fair value.

For the year ended 2008, net revenues were $27.5 million, an increase of $0.3 million from 2007.
The increase was a result of higher commercial and industrial gas marketing revenues.

Operating Income

The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $14.5 million in 2009 compared to
operating income of $2.0 million for 2008 due mainly to $22.0 million of higher operating expenses
partly offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses for 2009 included
impairments of $16.6 million, $4.4 million and $0.7 million recorded on Lake Erie Land, three NDC
Douglas Properties and the unregulated natural gas marketing business associated with programs to
sell certain net assets described above.

The Other Operations segment reported operating income of $2.0 million in 2008 compared to
operating income of $0.5 million for 2007 due to lower operating expenses and higher net revenues
described above. Operating expenses for 2008 include a gain of $0.5 million on the sale of certain
land compared to losses impacting 2007.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of NiSource Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements of consolidated
long-term debt of NiSource Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
and the related consolidated statements of income, of common stockholders’ equity and comprehensive
income (loss), and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009.
Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at item 8. These
financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial
statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain a
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also,
in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26,
2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of NiSource Inc.:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of NiSource Inc. and subsidiaries
(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting at Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control
— Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2009, of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2010
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.

ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

A. Company Structure and Principles of Consolidation.

NiSource, a Delaware corporation, is a
holding company whose subsidiaries provide natural gas, electricity and other products and services
to approximately 3.8 million customers located within a corridor that runs from the Gulf Coast
through the Midwest to New England. NiSource is a holding company under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 2005. NiSource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the
operating results of its fifteen direct subsidiaries.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NiSource and its majority-owned
subsidiaries after the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. Investments for
which at least a 20% interest is owned, certain joint ventures and limited partnership interests of
more than 3% are accounted for under the equity method. Except where noted above and in the event
where NiSource has significant influence, investments with less than a 20% interest are accounted
for under the cost method. NiSource also consolidates variable interest entities for which
NiSource is the primary beneficiary.

Within the December 31, 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet, NiSource recorded accounts receivable
credit balances with customer deposits as the line item, “Customer deposits and credits”, within
Current Liabilities. The prior period amount of $148.6 million in customer credit balances were
reclassified from “Other accruals” to Customer deposits and credits” to conform to the 2009
Consolidated Balance Sheet presentation.

B. Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United
States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

C. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash.

NiSource considers all investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. NiSource reports amounts deposited in
brokerage accounts for margin requirements as restricted cash. In addition, NiSource has amounts
deposited in trust to satisfy requirements for the provision of various property, liability,
workers compensation, and long-term disability insurance, which is classified as restricted cash
and disclosed as an investing cash flow on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.

Restricted cash was $174.7 million and $286.6 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was due primarily to the change in forward gas
prices which resulted in decreased margin deposits on open derivative contracts.

D. Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenue.

Accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets includes both billed and unbilled amounts as NiSource believes that total accounts
receivable is a more meaningful presentation, given the factors which impact both billed and
unbilled accounts receivable. Unbilled revenue is based on estimated amounts of electric energy or
natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its customers. Unbilled amounts of accounts receivable
relate to a portion of a customer’s consumption of gas or electricity from the date of the last
cycle billing date through the last day of the month (balance sheet date). Factors taken into
consideration when estimating unbilled revenue include historical usage, customer rates and
weather. Accounts receivable fluctuates from year to year depending in large part on weather
impacts and price volatility. NiSource’s accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
includes unbilled revenue, less reserves, in the amounts of $258.7 million and $284.5 million for
the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

E. Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.

NiSource’s investments in debt and equity
securities are carried at fair value and are designated as available-for-sale. These investments
are included within “Other investments” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and
losses, net of deferred income taxes, are
reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These investments are monitored for
other than temporary declines in market value. Realized gains and losses and permanent impairments
are reflected in the


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Statements of Consolidated Income. No material impairment charges were recorded for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

F. Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.

Rate-regulated subsidiaries account for
and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which
regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing
the regulated service and it is probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain
expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in
income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related
amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers.

In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its
costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the
criteria for regulatory accounting. In such event, a write-down of all or a portion of NiSource’s
existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery was approved
by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted
accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such
recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable
amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of regulatory accounting, NiSource would be
required to apply the provisions of Discontinuation of Rate-Regulated Accounting. In management’s
opinion, NiSource’s regulated subsidiaries will be subject to regulatory accounting for the
foreseeable future. Refer to Note 8, “Regulatory Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.

G. Utility Plant and Other Property and Related Depreciation and Maintenance.

Property, plant and
equipment (principally utility plant) is stated at cost. The rate-regulated subsidiaries record
depreciation using composite rates on a straight-line basis over the remaining service lives of the
electric, gas and common properties as approved by the appropriate regulators.

The depreciation provisions for utility plant, as a percentage of the original cost, for the
periods ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:




Electric Operations

3.4

%

3.7

%

3.6

%

Gas Distribution and Transmission Operations

2.9

%

2.8

%

2.9

%

For rate-regulated companies, AFUDC is capitalized on all classes of property except organization
costs, land, autos, office equipment, tools and other general property purchases. The allowance is
applied to construction costs for that period of time between the date of the expenditure and the
date on which such project is completed and placed in service. The pre-tax rate for AFUDC was 3.8%
in 2009, 3.3% in 2008 and 5.5% in 2007. Short-term borrowings were primarily used to fund
construction efforts in 2008 and 2007. The increase in the 2009 AFUDC rate, as compared with 2008,
was due to an increased weighted effect and use of long-term borrowings and equity funds that more
than offset a decrease in short-term interest rates associated with the amount of short-term
borrowings used for construction.

Generally, NiSource’s subsidiaries follow the practice of charging maintenance and repairs,
including the cost of removal of minor items of property, to expense as incurred. When regulated
property that represents a retired unit is replaced or removed, the cost of such property is
credited to utility plant, and such cost, net of salvage, is charged to the accumulated provision
for depreciation in accordance with composite depreciation.

H. Carrying Charges and Deferred Depreciation.

Upon completion of units 17 and 18 at the R. M.
Schafer Generating Station, Northern Indiana capitalized the carrying charges and deferred
depreciation in accordance with orders of the IURC, pending the inclusion of the cost of each unit in rates. Such carrying charges
and deferred depreciation are being amortized over the remaining service life of each unit.

Northern Indiana has capitalized carrying charges and deferred depreciation and certain operating
expenses relating to its scrubber service agreement for its Bailly Generating Station in accordance
with an order of the IURC. The accumulated balance of the deferred costs and related carrying
charges is being amortized over the remaining life of the scrubber service agreement.


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

On May 28, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving the purchase of Sugar Creek, and on May 30,
2008 Northern Indiana purchased the 535mw CCGT for $330 million in order to help meet capacity
needs. On February 18, 2009, the IURC issued an order approving a settlement agreement filed in
this proceeding allowing Northern Indiana to begin deferring carrying costs and depreciation,
pending inclusion in rates, on Sugar Creek effective on December 1, 2008, when Sugar Creek was
dispatched into MISO, at the agreed to carrying cost rate of 6.5%. The annual deferral for Sugar
Creek is reduced by the annual depreciation on the Mitchell plant of $4.5 million, pursuant to the
FAC-71 settlement. The terms of recovery of the deferral and inclusion of Sugar Creek in rates will
be resolved in Northern Indiana’s current rate proceeding.

In 2005, the PUCO authorized Columbia of Ohio to revise its depreciation accrual rates for the
period beginning January 1, 2005. The revised depreciation rates are now higher than those which
would have been utilized if Columbia of Ohio were not subject to regulation. The amount of
depreciation that would have been recorded for 2005 through 2009 had Columbia of Ohio not been
subject to rate regulation is a combined $183.4 million, a $29.4 million decrease over the $212.8
million reflected in rates. The regulatory asset was $102.3 million and $108.0 million as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The amount of depreciation that would have been recorded for 2009 had Columbia of Ohio not been
subject to rate regulation is $45.1 million, a $5.7 million decrease over the $50.8 million
reflected in rates.

I. Amortization of Software Costs.

External and internal costs associated with computer software
developed for internal use are capitalized. Capitalization of such costs commences upon the
completion of the preliminary stage of each project. Once the installed software is ready for its
intended use, such capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis generally over a period
of five years. NiSource amortized $27.7 million in 2009, $23.1 million in 2008 and $22.0 million
in 2007 related to software costs. NiSource's unamortized software balance was $100.5 million and
$92.1 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

J. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

NiSource has approximately $4.0 billion in goodwill and
other intangible assets. Substantially all goodwill relates to the excess of cost over the fair
value of the net assets acquired in the Columbia acquisition. In addition, NiSource has other
intangible assets consisting primarily of franchise rights apart from goodwill that were identified
as part of the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisition of Bay State, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of NiSource, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over forty
years from the date of acquisition. Refer to Note 6, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

K. Long-lived Assets.

NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets contain significant long-lived
assets other than goodwill and intangible assets discussed above which are not subject to recovery
under regulatory accounting. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential
earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value could be impaired. Refer to Note 3, “Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges,” in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

L. Revenue Recognition.

Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility
revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual
basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in
advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and
recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. For park and loan agreements, cash is
received at inception of the service period resulting in the recording of deferred revenues that
are recognized in revenues over the period the services are provided.

M. Earnings Per Share.

Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders
by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The weighted
average shares outstanding for diluted EPS include the incremental effects of the various long-term
incentive compensation plans.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2009, 2008, and 2007 excludes out-of-the-money
stock options that had an anti-dilutive effect.


ITEM 8.

N. Estimated Rate Refunds

. Certain rate-regulated subsidiaries collect revenues subject to
refund pending final determination in rate proceedings. In connection with such revenues,
estimated rate refund liabilities are recorded which reflect management’s current judgment of
the ultimate outcomes of the proceedings. No provisions are made when, in the opinion of
management, the facts and circumstances preclude a reasonable estimate of the outcome.

O. Accounts Receivable Sales Program.

NiSource enters into agreements with third parties to sell
certain accounts receivable without recourse. These sales are reflected as reductions of accounts
receivable in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and as operating cash flows in the
accompanying Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. The costs of these programs, which are based
upon the purchasers’ level of investment and borrowing costs, are charged to Other, net in the
accompanying Statements of Consolidated Income. Refer to Note 19, “Transfers of Financial Assets,”
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

P. Fuel Adjustment Clause.

All metered electric rates contain a provision for adjustment to
reflect increases and decreases in the cost of fuel and the fuel cost of purchased power through
operation of a FAC. As prescribed by order of the IURC applicable to metered retail rates, the
adjustment factor has been calculated based on the estimated cost of fuel and the fuel cost of
purchased power in a future three-month period. If two statutory requirements relating to expense
and return levels are satisfied, any under-recovery or over-recovery caused by variances between
estimated and actual costs in a given three-month period are recorded as adjustments to revenue and
will be included in a future filing, provided that the purchased power benchmark has not been
exceeded. Northern Indiana records any under-recovery or over-recovery as a current regulatory
asset or liability until such time as it is billed or refunded to its customers. The fuel
adjustment factor is subject to a quarterly review by the IURC and remains in effect for a
three-month period.

Q. Gas Cost Adjustment Clause.

All of NiSource’s Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries defer
most differences between gas purchase costs and the recovery of such costs in revenues, and adjust
future billings for such deferrals on a basis consistent with applicable state-approved tariff
provisions.

R. Gas Inventory.

Both the LIFO inventory methodology and the weighted average cost methodology
are used to value natural gas in storage, as approved by state regulators for each of NiSource’s
regulated subsidiaries. Inventory valued using LIFO was $313.8 million and $382.4 million at
December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Based on the average cost of gas using the LIFO method,
the estimated replacement cost of gas in storage at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
exceeded the stated LIFO cost by $295.4 million and $274.9 million, respectively. Inventory valued
using the weighted average cost methodology was $71.0 million at December 31, 2009 and $129.4
million at December 31, 2008.

S. Accounting for Exchange and Balancing Arrangements of Natural Gas.

NiSource’s Gas Transmission
and Storage and Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries enter into balancing and exchange
arrangements of natural gas as part of their operations and off-system sales programs. NiSource
records a receivable or payable for their respective cumulative gas imbalances and for any gas
inventory borrowed or lent under an exchange agreement. These receivables and payables are
recorded as “Exchange gas receivable” or “Exchange gas payable” on NiSource’s Consolidated Balance
Sheets, as appropriate.


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

T. Accounting for Emissions Allowances.

Northern Indiana has obtained SO2 and NOx emissions
allowances from the EPA based upon its electric generation operations that the utility may sell,
trade or hold for future use. Northern Indiana utilizes the inventory model in accounting for
these emissions allowances, whereby these allowances were recognized at zero cost upon receipt from
the EPA. Proceeds received from the annual EPA auction of allowances and through the utilization
of allowances in the generation of power for off-system sales are deferred as regulatory
liabilities. The sale of other allowances, not used due to investments made by NiSource in
pollution control assets and services, are reflected in earnings in the period in which they occur
and are included in net cash flows from operating activities in NiSource’s Statements of
Consolidated Cash Flows.

U. Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities.

ASC Topic 815 — Derivatives
and Hedging establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as
derivatives) and for hedging activities. ASC Topic 815 — Derivatives and Hedging requires an
entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets at fair value, unless such contracts are exempted as a normal purchase normal sale under the
provisions of the standard. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends
on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Refer to Note 9, “Risk Management
and Energy Marketing Activities,” of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.

V. Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits.

NiSource records income taxes to recognize full
interperiod tax allocations. Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are provided for
the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to
future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of
existing assets and liabilities. Previously recorded investment tax credits of the regulated
subsidiaries were deferred on the balance sheet and are being amortized to book income over the
regulatory life of the related properties to conform to regulatory policy.

To the extent certain deferred income taxes of the regulated companies are recoverable or payable
through future rates, regulatory assets and liabilities have been established. Regulatory assets
for income taxes are primarily attributable to property related tax timing differences for which
deferred taxes had not been provided in the past, when regulators did not recognize such taxes as
costs in the rate-making process. Regulatory liabilities for income taxes are primarily
attributable to the regulated companies’ obligation to refund to ratepayers deferred income taxes
provided at rates higher than the current federal income tax rate. Such amounts are credited to
ratepayers using either the average rate assumption method or the reverse South Georgia method.

Pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code and relevant state taxing authorities, NiSource and its
subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns for federal and certain state jurisdictions.
NiSource and its subsidiaries are parties to an agreement (Tax Allocation Agreement) that provides
for the allocation of consolidated tax liabilities. The Tax Allocation Agreement generally
provides that each party is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be owed had the
party been separately subject to tax. Any net benefit attributable to the parent is reallocated to
other members.

W. Environmental Expenditures.

NiSource accrues for costs associated with environmental
remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs is probable and the amounts can be
reasonably estimated, regardless of when the expenditures are actually made. The undiscounted
estimated future expenditures are based on currently
enacted laws and regulations, existing technology and estimated site-specific costs where
assumptions may be made about the nature and extent of site contamination, the extent of cleanup
efforts, costs of alternative cleanup methods and other variables. The liability is adjusted as
further information is discovered or circumstances change. The reserves for estimated
environmental expenditures are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in “Legal and
environmental reserves” for short-term portions of these liabilities and “Other noncurrent
liabilities” for the respective long-term portions of these liabilities. Rate-regulated
subsidiaries applying regulatory accounting establish regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets to the extent that future recovery of environmental remediation costs is probable through
the regulatory process.

In addition, Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC in 2003 to recover costs associated
with environmental compliance programs for NOx pollution-reduction equipment at Northern Indiana’s
generating stations. Refer to Note 8, “Regulatory Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information.

X. Excise Taxes.

NiSource accounts for excise taxes that are customer liabilities by separately
stating on its invoices the tax to its customers and recording amounts invoiced as liabilities
payable to the applicable taxing jurisdiction. These types of taxes, comprised largely of sales
taxes collected, are presented on a net basis affecting neither revenues nor cost of sales.
NiSource accounts for other taxes for which it is liable by recording a liability for the expected
tax with a corresponding charge to “Other taxes” expense.

2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.

In September 2006, the FASB amended guidance to define
fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and to expand disclosures about fair
value measurements. Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in
which the reporting entity transacts. Fair value should be based on the assumptions market
participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The adoption of the amended fair value
measurements and disclosures on January 1, 2008 did not have an impact on NiSource’s balance of
retained earnings.

In February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date of fair value measurement and disclosure
guidance for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of non-financial assets and liabilities until
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The delayed guidance became effective for all
nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2009.

In October 2008, the FASB clarified the application of the guidance in a market that is not active
and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a
financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. The clarification was
effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which financial statements had not been
issued.

In April 2009, the FASB provided additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and
level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. The additional guidance
was effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, with early adoption
permitted. NiSource adopted the additional guidance on April 1, 2009.

In August 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance clarifying the measurement of the fair value
of a liability in circumstances when a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability
is not available. The guidance emphasizes that entities should maximize the use of observable
inputs in the absence of quoted prices when measuring the fair value of liabilities. This guidance
became effective on October 1, 2009.

In September 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that provides further clarification for
measuring the fair value of investments in entities that meet the FASB’s definition of an
investment company. This guidance permits a company to estimate the fair value of an investment
using the net asset value per share of the investment if the net asset value is determined in
accordance with the FASB’s guidance for investment companies as of the company’s measurement date.
This creates a practical expedient to determining a fair value estimate and certain attributes of
the investment (such as redemption restrictions) will not be considered in measuring fair value.
Additionally, companies with investments within the scope of this guidance must disclose additional
information related to the nature and risks of the investments. This guidance is effective as of
December 31, 2009 and is required to be applied prospectively. NiSource has alternative
investments that are within the scope of this guidance. However, the fair value of the alternative
investments are already determined based on the net asset values per fund. The adoption of this
guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amends the disclosures about transfers
into and out of Level 1 and 2 and requires separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances,
and settlements relating to Level 3 measurements. This guidance also clarifies existing fair value
disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to
measure fair value. This guidance is effective for the first reporting

period, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to
provide Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, which
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted.
NiSource is currently reviewing the additional requirements to determine the impact on the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Refer to Note 18, “Fair Value Disclosures,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

In April 2009, the FASB revised authoritative guidance
requiring disclosures about fair value of financial instruments of publicly traded companies as
well as annual financial statements. The guidance was effective for interim reporting periods
ending after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted. NiSource adopted the guidance on April
1, 2009. As the guidance provides only disclosure requirements, the application of this ASC topic
did not impact the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 18, “Fair Value Disclosures,”
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Business Combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB amended authoritative guidance to improve the
relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of information that a reporting entity
provides in its financial reports regarding business combinations and its effects, including
recognition of assets and liabilities, the measurement of goodwill and required disclosures. This
guidance was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
on or after December 15, 2008 and earlier adoption was prohibited. The adoption of the amendment
on January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In April 2009, the FASB addressed application issues on initial recognition and measurement,
subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from
contingencies in a business combination. The additional guidance was effective for fiscal years,
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance
to amend the manner in which entities evaluate whether consolidation is required for VIEs. The
model for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest and is the primary
beneficiary of a VIE has changed significantly under the new guidance. Previously, variable
interest holders had to determine whether they had a controlling financial interest in a VIE based
on a quantitative analysis of the expected gains and/or losses of the entity. In contrast, the new
guidance requires an enterprise with a variable interest in a VIE to qualitatively assess whether
it has a controlling financial interest in the entity, and if so, whether it is the primary
beneficiary. Furthermore, this guidance requires that companies continually evaluate VIEs for
consolidation, rather than assessing based upon the occurrence of triggering events. This revised
guidance also requires enhanced disclosures about how a company’s involvement with a VIE affects
its financial statements and exposure to risks. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on the first fiscal year that begins after
November 15,
2009 with early adoption prohibited. NiSource is currently reviewing the additional requirements
to determine the impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Transfer of Financial Assets.

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to amend
derecognition criteria guidance in ASC 860 to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness,
and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements
about a transfer of financial assets; the effects of a transfer on its financial position,
financial performance, and cash flows; and a transferor’s continuing involvement, if any, in
transferred financial assets. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning on the first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2009
with early adoption prohibited. NiSource has reviewed the accounting and additional disclosure
requirements to determine the impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. This Statement will require transfers of accounts receivable
that previously qualified for sales accounting, to be recorded as debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
effective January 1, 2010. Refer to Note 19, “Transfers of Financial Assets,” for additional
information.

3. Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges

Impairments.

An impairment loss shall be recognized only if the carrying amount of a long lived
asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The test compares the carrying amount of the
long lived asset to the fair value of the assets sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to
result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.

Lake Erie Land, which is wholly-owned by NiSource and within the company’s Other Segment, was in
the process of selling real estate over a 10-year period as a part of an agreement reached in June
2006 with a private real estate development group. In the second quarter of 2009, the developer
was unable to meet certain contractual obligations under the sale agreement. NiSource granted a
limited extension for the developer to meet its contractual obligations and began negotiations with
another potential buyer to replace the original developer under the existing agreement. In July
2009, NiSource signed a letter of intent with the new potential buyer which was reaffirmed in
October 2009. However, in the fourth quarter of 2009, an agreement was not reached for the sale of
the real estate as was previously expected, and a sale within the next twelve months is no longer
probable. As such, certain real estate assets previously classified as held for sale are no longer
reflected as held for sale as of December 31, 2009. Concurrent with the determination that it was
not probable that the original developer would execute the future sales under the existing
agreement and a new developer would not replace the original developer, NiSource tested the assets
for impairment. The company compared the carrying value of the assets to the fair value,
determined primarily through independent appraisals, and recorded an impairment loss of $16.6
million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The total impairment charge is comprised of $8.8 million
recognized due to the uncollectability of certain receivables due from the acquirer of the property
and $7.8 million due to the current book value exceeding the fair value of certain real estate
property remaining to be sold under the installment sales agreement as of December 31, 2009. The
book value of the impaired assets at December 31, 2009, subsequent to the impairment charge, is
$27.0 million.

For 2009, NiSource recognized $4.4 million in expense for an impairment charge related to the four
properties NDC Douglas Properties owns which do not currently meet the assets held for sale
criteria as their estimated sale date is greater than one year. Based on previous impairments
recorded on other NDC Douglas Properties, the properties were tested for impairment during the
third quarter of 2009. NDC Douglas Properties property, plant, and equipment assets were valued
based on a discounted cash flow model utilizing estimated future cash flows. The book value of
these assets at December 31, 2009, subsequent to the impairment charge, is $7.0 million.

For 2008, NiSource recognized $3.4 million in expense for the impairment of the Marble Cliff
facility discussed in Note 4, “Discontinued Operation and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale.”
For 2007, NiSource recognized $11.0 million in expense for the impairment of assets, including a
$7.2 million impairment charge related to base gas at a storage field.

Restructuring.

During the first quarter of 2009, NiSource began an organizational restructuring
initiative, beginning with Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, in response to the decline in
overall economic conditions.

In February 2009, NiSource announced the restructuring of the Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations segment. NiSource has eliminated positions across the 16 state operating territory of
Gas Transmission and Storage. The reductions have occurred through voluntary programs and
involuntary separations. In addition to employee reductions, the Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations segment took steps to achieve additional cost savings by efficiently managing its
various business locations, reducing its fleet operations, creating alliances with third party
service providers, and implementing other changes in line with its strategic plan for growth and
maximizing value of existing assets. During 2009, NiSource recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge
related to this initiative, net of adjustments, of $19.9 million to “Operation and maintenance”
expense on the Statement of Consolidated Income, which primarily includes costs related to severance and other employee related costs. As of December 31, 2009, 309 employees had been terminated
from employment.

In September 2009, NiSource announced the restructuring of Northern Indiana, which aims to redefine
business and operations strategies and achieve cost reductions, and impacts both Electric
Operations and Gas Distribution Operations. During 2009, NiSource recorded a pre-tax restructuring
charge related to this initiative, net of adjustments, of $5.4 million to “Operation and
maintenance” expense on the Statement of Consolidated Income,

which primarily includes costs
related to severance and other employee related costs for approximately 43 employees and outside
services costs. As of December 31, 2009, 36 employees had been terminated from employment.

During the second and third quarters of 2009, NiSource was pursuing the sale of its unregulated
natural gas marketing business. In both periods, net assets for the business were accounted for as
assets and liabilities of discontinued operations and the results of operations and cash flows were
classified as discontinued operations. Additionally, a cumulative loss on sale of discontinued
operations (net of tax) of $8.8 million and $12.4 million was recognized for the second quarter and
third quarter, respectively. In the fourth quarter, it was determined the sale was no longer
probable because NiSource could no longer assert that a sale would take place within the next
twelve months. As such, the assets and liabilities were reclassified to assets held and used.
Additionally, the results of operations and cash flows were reclassified to continuing operations
for all periods presented. Included in its 2009 results, NiSource recognized an additional $13.7
million pre-tax reserve and other charges for the unregulated natural gas marketing business
primarily related to (1) a reserve against certain derivative assets of $9.2 million and (2) other
charges of $3.7 million. Refer to Note 9, “Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities,” in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to price risk
assets.

Lake Erie Land, which is wholly-owned by NiSource, was in the process of selling real estate over a
10-year period as a part of an agreement reached in June 2006 with a private real estate

letter of intent with the new potential buyer which was reaffirmed in October 2009. However, in
the fourth quarter of 2009, an agreement was not reached for the sale of the real estate as was
previously expected, and a sale within the next twelve months is no longer probable. As such,
certain real estate assets previously classified as held for sale are no longer reflected as held
for sale as of December 31, 2009. An impairment loss of $16.6 million was recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2009 as discussed in Note 3, “Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges.”

NDC Douglas Properties, a subsidiary of NiSource Development Company, is in the process of exiting
some of its low income housing investments. Five of these properties are classified as assets and
liabilities held for sale, and results of operations and cash flows for these properties are
classified as discontinued operations. Based on the expected proceeds from the sale of the five
properties being less than the net book value, an impairment charge of $2.7 million, net of tax,
was included in Loss on Disposition of Discontinued Operations in the Statements of Consolidated
Income for the year ended December 31, 2009. A purchase agreement was executed for the sale of
three of the properties on November 20, 2009; however, the sale is not expected to be final until
the first quarter of 2010. The other two properties are expected to be sold in the second half of
2010.

NiSource Corporate Services is continuing to work with a potential buyer to sell its Marble Cliff
facility. A third party appraisal was performed in December 2009 with an estimated market value of
the property slightly higher than the book value. NiSource has accounted for this facility as
assets held for sale.

On June 18, 2009, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to abandon by sale to an
unaffiliated third party its Line R System in West Virginia, which includes certain natural gas
pipeline and compression facilities. These assets held for sale have a net book value of $2.4
million. The sale transaction is expected to close in 2010.

On June 30, 2008, NiSource sold Whiting Clean Energy to BPAE for $216.7 million, which included
$16.1 million in working capital. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the
operations of Whiting Clean Energy as discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31,
2008, an after tax loss of $32.3 million was included in Loss on Disposition of Discontinued
Operations in the Statements of Consolidated Income.

On December 1, 2008, NiSource sold NiSource subsidiaries Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas
to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million which included $49.1 million in
working capital. Under the terms of the transaction, Unitil Corporation acquired Northern
Utilities, a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in
Maine and New Hampshire and Granite State Gas, an 86-mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline
primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, an
after tax loss of $0.2 million and $75.8 million, respectively, was included in Loss on Disposition
of Discontinued Operations in the Statements of Consolidated Income.

During the second quarter of 2008, Bay State signed a letter of intent to sell certain assets,
including water heater rentals and other service agreements. During April 2009, negotiations with
the potential buyer were terminated. NiSource has determined that it is no longer probable that
the property will be sold within twelve months and therefore, reclassified the assets from assets
held for sale to assets held and used during the second quarter 2009.

Results from discontinued operations from Whiting Clean Energy, Granite State Gas, Northern
Utilities, NDC Douglas Properties low income housing investments, and reserve changes for

Northern Indiana’s common utility plant and associated accumulated depreciation and amortization are allocated
between Gas Distribution Utility and Electric Utility Property, Plant and Equipment.

On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for approximately $330 million. This
purchase was in response to Northern Indiana’s need to add approximately 1,000 mw of new capacity.
Refer to Note 8, “Regulatory Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
further discussion. The Sugar Creek facility is a CCGT located in West Terre Haute, Indiana with a
plant capacity rating of 535 mw. Sugar Creek has transmission access to both the MISO and PJM
Interconnection wholesale electricity markets. As of December 1, 2008, the Sugar Creek facility
was dispatched into MISO. At acquisition, Northern Indiana recorded at fair value $328.1 million
related to utility plant. No goodwill was recorded in conjunction with the purchase. The
allocation of the purchase price was assigned to the assets and liabilities of Sugar Creek, based
on their estimated fair value.

6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

NiSource tests its goodwill for impairment annually as of June 30 each year unless indicators,
events, or circumstances would require an interim review. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a
level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit, which generally is an operating segment or a
component of an operating segment. Certain components of an operating segment with similar
economic characteristics are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit. Goodwill amounts are
generally allocated to the reporting units based upon the amounts allocated at the time of their
respective acquisition. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process which requires NiSource
to make estimates regarding the fair value of the reporting unit. The first step of the goodwill
impairment test, used
to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying
value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount,
goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired, thus the second step of the impairment
test is not required. However, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair
value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of
impairment loss (if any), which compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the
carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the
implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

NiSource has four reporting units that carry or are allocated goodwill. NiSource’s goodwill assets
at December 31, 2009 were $3,677.3 million pertaining primarily to the acquisition of Columbia on
November 1, 2000. Of this


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

amount, approximately $1,975.5 million is allocated to Columbia Transmission Operations (which is
comprised of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf) and $1,683.0 million is allocated to Columbia
Distribution Operations (which is comprised of Columbia of Kentucky, Columbia of Maryland, Columbia
of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania and Columbia of Virginia). In addition, the goodwill balances at
December 31, 2009 for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas were $13.3 million and $5.5
million, respectively.

In estimating the fair value of the Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution
Operations reporting units for the June 30, 2009 test, NiSource used a weighted average of the
income and market approach. Under the income approach, NiSource utilized a valuation technique
based on discounted cash flows that incorporates internal projections of expected future cash flows
and operating results to estimate a fair value of each reporting unit. Under the market approach,
NiSource utilized three market-based models to estimate the fair value of the reporting units: (i)
the comparable company multiples method, which estimated fair value of each reporting unit by
analyzing EBITDA multiples of a peer group of publicly traded companies and applying that multiple
to the reporting units EBITDA, (ii) the comparable transactions method, which valued the reporting
unit based on observed EBITDA multiples from completed transactions of peer companies and applying
that multiple to the reporting unit’s EBITDA and (iii) the market capitalization method, which used
the NiSource share price and allocated NiSource’s total market capitalization among both the
goodwill and non-goodwill reporting units based on the relative EBITDA, revenues and operating
income of each reporting unit. Each of the three market approaches were calculated with the
assistance of a third party valuation firm, using multiples and assumptions inherent in today’s
market. The degree of judgment involved and reliability of inputs into each model were considered
in weighting the various approaches. The resulting estimate of fair value of the reporting units,
using the weighted average of the income and market approaches, exceeded their carrying values,
indicating that no impairment exists, under step 1 of the annual impairment test. No impairment
has been required in previous periods as well.

Certain key assumptions used in determining the fair values of the reporting units included planned
operating results, discount rates and the long-term outlook for growth. NiSource used discount
rates, based on the weighted average cost of capital, of 5.68% and 6.04% for Columbia Transmission
Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, respectively. Growth rates for Columbia
Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations are 3% and 3.59%, respectively, which
are slightly less than the growth rates used in the prior years. Management also performed a
sensitivity analysis using discount rates of 6.55% and 6.91% for Columbia Transmission Operations
and Columbia Distribution Operations, respectively. Using the discount rates of 5.68% and 6.04%
for Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, respectively, the excess
fair values were approximately $1,500 million for each reporting unit. If the discount rates were
increased to 6.55% and 6.91% for Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution
Operations, respectively, the excess fair value would be approximately $700 million and
approximately $500 million, respectively. Under either discount rate scenario, the impairment test
indicated that a write-down of goodwill was not required.

Because NiSource’s reportable entities with goodwill consist of regulated companies, the regulated
recovery rates and approved rate of returns allow for a more predictable and steady stream of
revenue and cash flows. This helps mitigate the impacts that might otherwise be felt from the
recessionary trends seen in other industries and also adds more reliability to the cash flow
forecasts used to calculate the fair value in the discounted cash flow model.
NiSource reviewed its estimates and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model at June 30,
2009, noting that there are no significant changes that would be made in light of the current
economic environment. In addition, the 2009 operating results for the Gas Distribution Operations
and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments exceeded 2009 estimates used to calculate fair
value in the June 30, 2009 annual impairment test.

It should be noted that all ratings for NiSource’s senior unsecured debt continue to be investment
grade. Further, NiSource’s stock price between December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009 has
performed better than the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Dow Jones Utility Average,
which increased 18.8% and 7.3%, respectively. NiSource’s stock price increased in the same period
by 40.2%.

Goodwill related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $13.3
million and $5.5 million, respectively, was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2009 using an
income approach to determine the fair value of each of these reporting units. A discount rate
range of 6.04% to 6.91% and growth rates, factoring in the regulatory environment and growth
initiatives, for each reporting unit were the significant assumptions used in determining the fair
values using the income approach. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair

value of each of these reporting units exceeding the carrying value. Goodwill for Kokomo Gas of
$13.3 million is net of an impairment charge of $10.9 million, which was required based on the June
30, 2005 annual impairment test. No other impairment has been recorded for Kokomo Gas or Northern
Indiana Fuel.

NiSource considered whether there were any events or changes in circumstances during the third and
fourth quarters of 2009 that would reduce the fair value of any of the reporting units below their
carrying amounts and necessitate another goodwill impairment test. No such indicators were noted
which would require goodwill impairment testing during the these quarters.

NiSource’s intangible assets, apart from goodwill, consist of franchise rights, which were
identified as part of the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisition in February
1999 of Bay State. These amounts were $319.6 million and $330.6 million, net of amortization of
$122.6 million and $111.6 million, at December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively, and are being
amortized over forty years from the date of acquisition. NiSource recorded amortization expense of
$11.0 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007 related to its intangible assets.

NiSource has recognized asset retirement obligations associated with various obligations including
costs to remove and dispose of certain construction materials located within many of NiSource’s
facilities, certain costs to retire pipeline, removal costs for certain underground storage tanks,
removal of certain pipelines known to contain PCB contamination, closure costs for certain sites
including ash ponds, solid waste management units and a landfill, obligations to return leased rail
cars to specified conditions and the removal costs of certain, as well as some other nominal asset
retirement obligations. NiSource recognizes that there are obligations to incur significant costs
to retire wells associated with gas storage operations; however, these assets are land assets with
indeterminable lives. Additionally, NiSource has a significant obligation associated with the
decommissioning of its two hydro facilities located in Indiana. These hydro facilities also have
an indeterminate life, and no asset retirement obligation has been recorded.

Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and
collected in the service rates of the rate-regulated subsidiaries are classified as regulatory
liabilities and other removal costs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Gas Distributions Operations annual cut and cap additions and settlements for its pipe system for
2009 were $6.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively. Northern Indiana performed retirement
activities associated with a landfill and asbestos removal resulting in settlements of $1.0 million
for 2009. Northern Indiana also recorded additions of $2.0 million for 2009 related to landfill
activities.

With the adoption of provisions in the ASC topic for retirement benefits, NiSource determined that
for certain rate-regulated subsidiaries the future recovery of pension and other postretirement
plans costs is probable. These rate-regulated subsidiaries recorded amounts that would otherwise
have been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to a regulatory asset account.
Refer to Note 12, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information. These amounts are adjusted annually as part of
the year-end valuation of pension and other post retirement plan assets and liabilities.

Regulatory assets, including underrecovered gas and fuel cost, of approximately $1,753.5 million as
of December 31, 2009 are not presently included in rate base and consequently are not earning
a return on investment. Regulatory assets of approximately $1,452.1 million include expenses
that are recovered as components of the cost of service and are generally covered by
regulatory orders. These costs are recovered over a remaining life of up to 43 years.
Regulatory assets of approximately $301.4 million require specific rate action.

Gas Distribution Operations Regulatory Matters

Significant Rate Developments.

Northern Indiana currently has plans underway for the
filing of a gas rate case, the first since 1987. The filing is expected to be made in 2010, with
new rates anticipated to be effective in early 2011.

In March 2009, Indiana Governor Daniels signed Senate Bill 423 into law giving the Indiana
Finance Authority the ability to contract, on behalf of gas customers in the state of Indiana,
with developers capable of building facilities that manufacture Substitute Natural Gas from
coal. The Indiana Finance Authority received one bid, from Indiana Gasification, by the April
9, 2009 deadline to initiate a Substitute Natural Gas plant in Southern Indiana under a 30
year contract. Current law requires that all Indiana gas utilities including Northern Indiana
will be delivering a portion of Substitute Natural Gas from this facility, once it is built.
The IURC must approve the final contract between the Indiana Finance Authority and Indiana
Gasification.

On October 21, 2009, the IURC issued an Order in the proceeding concerning Northern Indiana’s
annual gas recovery, rejecting the use of a four-year average to compute unaccounted for gas.
This Order will require Northern Indiana to refund an estimated $5.8 million to customers
based on a calculation utilizing a 1-year average of unaccounted for gas for the twelve month
periods ended July 31, 2008 and July 31, 2009. A reserve has been provided for the full
amount of the refund, which will be returned to customers beginning in March, 2010.

On December 9, 2009, Northern Indiana filed a Petition with the IURC to extend its alternative
regulatory programs that expire on May 1, 2010. On February 12, 2010, Northern Indiana, the OUCC
and gas marketers supplying gas to residential and small commercial customers filed a Joint
Stipulation and Agreement proposing an extension the programs through March 31, 2012, subject to
IURC approval.

Columbia of Ohio filed a base rate case with the PUCO on March 3, 2008 and a settlement agreement
was filed on October 24, 2008. In the base rate case, Columbia of Ohio sought recovery of
increased infrastructure replacement costs, as well as the stabilization of revenues and cost
recovery through rate design. The agreement included an annual revenue increase of $47.1 million
and also provided for recovery of costs associated with Columbia of
Ohio’s infrastructure replacement program. On December 3, 2008, the PUCO approved the settlement
agreement in all material respects and approved Columbia of Ohio’s proposed rate design, with new
rates taking effect December 3, 2008.

On January 15, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO requesting authority to
increase Columbia of Ohio’s PIPP rider rate in order to collect $82.2 million in PIPP arrearages
over a period of three years, in addition to the projected level of arrearages expected to occur
during each of the succeeding twelve-month periods. On March 3, 2009, Columbia of Ohio’s proposal
was approved and became effective.

On
January  30, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application
 with the PUCO to implement a gas supply auction. The auction will
replace Columbia’s current GCR mechanism for
 providing commodity gas supplies to its sales customers. By order dated December 2, 2009, the PUCO approved a
stipulation that resolved all issues in the case. Pursuant to the stipulation, Columbia will conduct two consecutive
one-year long standard service offer auction periods starting April
2010 and April 2011. On February 23, 2010, Columbia
 held the first standard service offer auction which resulted in a final retail price adjustment of $1.93 per mcf.
 On February 24, the PUCO issued an Entry that approved the results of the auction and directed Columbia to proceed
with the implementation of the standard service offer process.

On February 27, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application to adjust rates associated with Rider
IRP. Rider IRP recovers costs associated with the replacement of natural gas risers that are prone
to failure; maintenance, repair and replacement of customers service lines; an Accelerated Mains
Replacement Program; and installation of Automatic Meter Reading Devices. On June 2, 2009, Columbia
of Ohio filed a Joint Stipulation and Recommendation that settled all issues. On June 24, 2009, the
PUCO issued an Order approving the Stipulation. Rates associated with Rider IRP were increased by
$13.8 million annually beginning in July 2009.

On November 30, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed a notice of intent to file an application to adjust
rates associated with Rider IRP and Rider DSM. Rider DSM tracks and recovers costs associated with
Columbia of Ohio’s energy efficiency and conservation programs. On February 26, 2010, Columbia
filed an application in support of its request to adjust rates with an anticipated effective date
of May 1, 2010.

On January 28, 2008, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC
seeking recovery of costs associated with its significant capital program, as well as stabilization
of revenues through modifications to rate design. On July 2, 2008, Columbia of Pennsylvania and
all interested parties filed a unanimous settlement and on October 23, 2008, the Pennsylvania PUC
issued an Order approving the settlement as filed, increasing annual revenues by $41.5 million.
New rates went into effect October 28, 2008.

On January 28, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC,
seeking an increase of approximately $32 million annually. The company anticipates a final order
will be received and rates will go into effect in the fourth quarter of 2010.

On October 1, 2008, Columbia of Maryland filed a base rate case with the Maryland PSC. On February
20, 2009, Columbia of Maryland and all interested parties filed a unanimous settlement in the case,
recommending an annual revenue increase of $1.2 million. On March 27, 2009, the settlement was
approved as filed.

On January 28, 2010, Columbia of Maryland filed a base rate case with the Maryland PSC, seeking an
increase of approximately $2 million annually. The company anticipates a final order will be
received and new rates will go into effect in the second quarter of 2010.

On April 16, 2009, Bay State filed a base rate case with the Massachusetts DPU, requesting an
annual increase of $34.2 million. In its initial filing, Bay State sought revenue decoupling, as
well a mechanism for the recovery of costs associated with the replacement of the company’s
infrastructure. On October 30, 2009, the Massachusetts DPU issued a decision granting the company
a $19.1 million base rate increase and approving the company’s
proposed revenue decoupling mechanism and infrastructure replacement program. New rates
went into effect November 1, 2009.

On May 1, 2009, Columbia of Kentucky filed a base rate case with the Kentucky PSC, requesting an
annual increase of $11.6 million. In its initial filing, Columbia of Kentucky sought enhancements
to rate design, as well as an expedited mechanism for the recovery of costs associated with the
replacement of the company’s infrastructure. A settlement agreement with all parties was presented
in a hearing before the Kentucky PSC on September 18, 2009. The settlement agreement provided for
a base rate increase of approximately $6 million, the authorization of an increase to the monthly
customer charge, the implementation of an Accelerated Main Replacement Program rider and the
introduction of a residential energy efficiency program. On October 26, 2009, the Kentucky PSC
approved the settlement agreement as filed, with new rates taking effect on October 27, 2009.

On June 8, 2009, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a CARE
Plan for a three-year period beginning January 1, 2010. The CARE Plan included incentives for
residential and small general service customers to actively pursue conservation and energy
efficiency measures, a surcharge designed to recover the costs of such measures on a real-time
basis, and a performance-based incentive for the delivery of conservation and energy efficiency
benefits. The CARE Plan also included a rate decoupling mechanism designed to mitigate the impact
of declining customer usage. On October 28, 2009, Columbia of Virginia and other parties to the
proceeding presented a unanimous settlement to the Hearing Examiner, which provided for approval of
the CARE Plan

Application with modifications. The settlement was approved by the VSCC on December 4, 2009, with

Cost Recovery and Trackers.

A significant portion of the distribution companies’ revenue is
related to the recovery of gas costs, the review and recovery of which occurs via standard
regulatory proceedings. All states require periodic review of actual gas procurement activity to
determine prudence and to permit the recovery of prudently incurred costs related to the supply of
gas for customers. NiSource distribution companies have historically been found prudent in the
procurement of gas supplies to serve customers.

Certain operating costs of the NiSource distribution companies are significant, recurring in
nature, and generally outside the control of the distribution companies. Some states allow the
recovery of such costs via cost tracking mechanisms. Such tracking mechanisms allow for
abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the distribution companies to implement charges and
recover appropriate costs. Tracking mechanisms allow for more timely recovery of such costs as
compared with more traditional cost recovery mechanisms. Examples of such mechanisms include GCR
adjustment mechanisms, tax riders, and bad debt recovery mechanisms.

Comparability of Gas Distribution Operations line item operating results is impacted by these
regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt
expenses. Increases in the expenses that are the subject of trackers result in a corresponding
increase in net revenues and therefore have essentially no impact on total operating income
results.

Certain of the NiSource distribution companies have completed rate proceedings involving
infrastructure replacement or are embarking upon regulatory initiatives to replace significant
portions of their operating systems that are nearing the end of their useful lives. Each LDC’s
approach to cost recovery may be unique, given the different laws, regulations and precedent that
exist in each jurisdiction. On February 27, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application to adjust
its Rider IRP to recover costs for risers and accelerated main replacements. On June 24, 2009, the
PUCO approved a stipulation allowing Columbia of Ohio to implement the new rider rate on July 1,
2009, resulting in an annual revenue increase of $14.2 million. On October 26, 2009, the Kentucky
PSC approved a mechanism for recovering the costs of Columbia of Kentucky’s Accelerated Main
Replacement Program. In the same Order the Kentucky PSC also approved a mechanism for the recovery
of Columbia of Kentucky’s uncollectible expenses associated with the cost of gas. On October 30,
2009, the Massachusetts DPU approved a mechanism for the recovery of costs associated with the
replacement of Bay State’s infrastructure.

On April 30, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO to defer pension and other
postretirement benefits expenses above those currently subject to collection in rates, effective
January 1, 2009. On July 8, 2009, the PUCO issued an Order approving Columbia of Ohio’s
application, although the deferred balances will not accrue carrying charges and Columbia of Ohio
may not seek recovery of pension and other postretirement benefits deferrals in a base rate
proceeding for a period of five years. The amount deferred was approximately $13 million in 2009.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations Regulatory Matters

Appalachian Expansion Project.

On August 22, 2008, the FERC issued an order to Columbia
Transmission, which granted a certificate to construct the project. The project included building
a new 9,470 hp compressor station in West Virginia. The Appalachian Expansion Project added
100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity and is fully subscribed on a 15-year contracted firm
basis. Construction is complete and the project was placed in service on July 1, 2009.

Eastern Market Expansion Project.

On January 14, 2008, the FERC issued an order which granted a
certificate to construct the project. The project allows Columbia Transmission to expand its
facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain
existing facilities. The Eastern Market Expansion added 97,000 Dth per day of storage and
transportation deliverability and is fully subscribed on a 15-year contracted firm basis.
Construction of the facilities is complete and was placed in service April 1, 2009.

Ohio Storage Project.

On June 24, 2008, Columbia Transmission filed an application before the FERC
for approval to expand two of its Ohio storage fields for additional capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and
103,400 Dth per day of

deliverability. Approval was granted in March 2009 and construction of the facilities began in
April 2009. Partial service related to this expansion was available beginning May 2009 and the
expansion was placed in full service during the fourth quarter of 2009. The expansion capacity is
58% contracted on a long-term, firm basis, with the FERC authorized market-based rates for these
and any future services.

Majorsville, PA Project.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is in the process of
executing three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA
vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Precedent
Agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009. On January 20, 2010,
Columbia Transmission filed with the FERC an application to transfer certain pipeline facilities to
a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream, LLC that, once approved, will be part of the
facilities providing non-FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA
vicinity. The Majorsville, PA project is expected to be in service by the end of the third quarter
2010.

Incentive Fixed Fuel Mechanism.

On November 9, 2009, Columbia Gulf filed an application before the
FERC for approval to replace Columbia Gulf’s existing Transportation Retainage Adjustment tracker
mechanism that Columbia Gulf currently relies upon to recover fuel with a proposed Incentive Fixed
Fuel mechanism. The Incentive Fixed Fuel would establish a fixed fuel rate and includes incentives
to improve pipeline infrastructure and reduce pipeline fuel requirements.

Electric Operations Regulatory Matters

Significant Rate Developments.

On June 27, 2008, Northern Indiana filed a petition for new
electric base rates and charges. It has been more than 22 years since Northern Indiana has had an
electric base rate increase. The filing requested an increase in base rates calculated to produce
additional gross margin of $85.7 million. Several stakeholder groups have intervened in the case,
representing customer groups and various counties and towns within Northern Indiana’s electric
service territory. Evidentiary hearings concluded on August 6, 2009, and the briefing schedule
concluded in January 2010. The case is expected to be resolved with new electric rates effective
during the first half of 2010.

Northern Indiana received a favorable regulatory order on February 18, 2009 related to its actions
to increase its electric generating capacity and advance its electric rate case. Acting on a
settlement reached among Northern Indiana and its regulatory stakeholders, the IURC ruled that
Northern Indiana’s Sugar Creek electric generating plant was in service for ratemaking purposes as
of December 1, 2008. The IURC also approved the deferral of depreciation expenses and carrying
costs associated with the $330 million Sugar Creek investment. Northern Indiana purchased Sugar
Creek on May 30, 2008 and effective December 1, 2008, Sugar Creek was accepted as an internal
designated network resource within the MISO.

Northern Indiana anticipates filing another electric base rate case during 2010. Among other
things, the filing is expected to include the effect of increased pension expense, as well as
demand levels based on more recent operating experience.

During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate
review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an Order adopting most aspects of the settlement.
The Order approving the settlement provides that certain electric customers of Northern Indiana
will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year. The credits will continue at
approximately the same annual level and per the same methodology, until the IURC enters a base rate
order that approves revised Northern Indiana electric rates. Credits amounting to $56.1 million,
$53.9 million and $56.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

On December 9, 2009, the IURC issued an order in its generic DSM investigation proceeding
establishing an overall annual energy savings goal of 2% to be achieved by Indiana jurisdictional
electric utilities in 10 years, with interim savings goals established in years one through nine.
Northern Indiana and other jurisdictional electric utilities must file DSM plans on July 1, 2010,
2013, 2016, and 2019, with annual updates in the interim periods. The IURC requires that certain
core programs be established and administered by an independent third party. The IURC did not make
any specific findings with respect to cost recovery issues. Northern Indiana is unable to
determine or quantify the impact of the order at this time.

MISO.

As part of Northern Indiana’s participation in the MISO transmission service, wholesale
energy and ancillary service markets, certain administrative fees and non-fuel costs have been
incurred. IURC orders have been issued authorizing the deferral for consideration in a future rate
case proceeding of certain non-fuel related costs incurred after Northern Indiana’s rate
moratorium, which expired on July 31, 2006. In its base rate case, Northern Indiana proposes
recovery of the cumulative amount of net non-fuel charges that were deferred as of December 31,
2008, and to recover, through a tracker, charges deferred between December 31, 2008 and the date of
effective rates in this case. As of December 31, 2009, Northern Indiana has deferred $3.5 million
of non-fuel charges pending the outcome of the current electric rate case proceeding.

On November 7, 2008, the FERC issued an Order clarifying the RSG First Pass calculation and
requiring the MISO to resettle the RSG market using the correct calculation and to pay refunds, or
assess surcharges, to market participants, as appropriate, to correct a misinterpretation of an
order issued by FERC in April 2006. Northern Indiana believes that it would have been entitled to
a refund, with the amount subject to calculation by MISO. On June 12, 2009, however, FERC issued
an order on rehearing in which it affirmed its prior order clarifying the method to calculate the
RSG First Pass rate, but reversed its ruling requiring the MISO to pay refunds, and collect
surcharges, on equitable grounds. Northern Indiana has asked FERC to reconsider its decision to
deny refunds and that request remains pending. MISO’s implementation of FERC’s April 2006 Order on
the RSG First Pass calculation resulted in several million dollars of surcharges to Northern
Indiana through market resettlements implemented during the summer of 2007. As a result, Northern
Indiana and Ameren jointly filed a complaint with FERC on August 10, 2007, contending that the RSG
rates in effect were unjust and unreasonable. On November 10, 2008, the FERC issued an Order
granting these complaints and ordering the MISO to calculate refunds and surcharges, as
appropriate, back to the date of the complaint filed by Northern Indiana and Ameren, as authorized
by
Section 206 of the Federal Power Act. On May 6, 2009, however, the FERC issued an Order that
upheld its decision granting the complaint, but largely reversed its directive requiring MISO to
pay refunds, and collect surcharges, on equitable grounds. The FERC affirmed the refund and
surcharge requirement only for those transactions that occurred after the date of the November 10,
2008 Order, instead of August 10, 2007, as it had previously required. Northern Indiana and Ameren
have requested rehearing of the FERC’s May 6, 2009 Order, and that request remains pending.

MISO and PJM Interconnection undertook a joint effort in April and May 2009 to identify a source of
unaccounted for flows on several coordinated flowgates. The analysis found that certain PJM
Interconnection generating units that were once associated with unit-specific capacity sales were
erroneously excluded from PJM Interconnection’s market flows, which significantly affected the
congestion price on reciprocally coordinated flowgates on Northern Indiana systems. Higher PJM
Interconnection market flows on congested flowgates would have resulted in higher payments to MISO
by PJM Interconnection during market to market coordination since April 1, 2005. The model was
fixed on June 18, 2009 and MISO and PJM Interconnection are currently in settlement discussions
with the FERC that began on October 19, 2009 to determine the financial impact of any
resettlements. Initial amounts calculated by PJM Interconnection approximated $78 million, while
MISO has performed a preliminary estimate of $125 to $150 million. The impact to Northern Indiana
cannot be reasonably estimated until a settlement is reached between MISO and PJM Interconnection,
and MISO receives approval from the FERC on an allocation methodology to its market participants.
Any adjustment will be neutral or favorable to operations.

Cost Recovery and Trackers.

A significant portion of Northern Indiana’s revenue is related to the
recovery of fuel costs to generate power and the fuel costs related to purchased power. These
costs are recovered through a FAC, a standard, quarterly, “summary” regulatory proceeding in
Indiana. Various intervenors, including the OUCC, had taken issue with the allocation of costs
included in Northern Indiana’s FAC-80, FAC-81 and FAC-82, which cover the reconciliation of April
— December 2008. The IURC granted a sub-docket to consider such issues in those filings. The
intervening parties and Northern Indiana discussed procedures to eliminate these concerns and to
resolve them for the historical periods. On November 4, 2009 the IURC approved a settlement
agreement which calls for a credit of $8.2 million to be provided to FAC customers beginning in
November 2009, less any amount for attorney’s fees and expenses.

On May 28, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving the purchase of Sugar Creek, and on May 30,
2008 Northern Indiana purchased the 535mw CCGT for $330 million in order to help meet capacity
needs. On February 18, 2009, the IURC issued an order approving a settlement agreement filed in
this proceeding allowing Northern Indiana to


ITEM 8.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

begin deferring carrying costs and depreciation, pending inclusion in rates, on Sugar Creek
effective on December 1, 2008, when Sugar Creek was dispatched into MISO, at the agreed to carrying
cost rate of 6.5%. The annual deferral for Sugar Creek is reduced by the annual depreciation on
the Mitchell plant of $4.5 million, pursuant to the FAC-71 settlement. The terms of recovery of the
deferral and inclusion of Sugar Creek in rates will be resolved in Northern Indiana’s current rate
proceeding.

As part of a settlement agreement which resolved issues surrounding purchased power costs, Northern
Indiana implemented a new “benchmarking standard,” that became effective in October 2007, which
defines the price above which purchased power costs must be absorbed by Northern Indiana and are
not permitted to be passed on to ratepayers. The benchmark is based upon the costs of power
generated by a hypothetical natural gas fired unit using gas purchased and delivered to Northern
Indiana and a set sharing mechanism. During 2009 and 2008, the amount of purchased power costs
exceeding the benchmark amounted to $1.0 million and $11.1 million, respectively, which was
recognized as a net reduction of revenues. The agreement also contemplated Northern Indiana adding
generating capacity to its existing portfolio by providing for the benchmark to be adjusted as new
capacity is added. The dispatch of Sugar Creek into MISO on December 1, 2008 triggered a change in
the benchmark, whereby the first 500 mw tier of the benchmark provision was eliminated.

Northern Indiana has approval from the IURC to recover certain environmental related costs through
an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the
capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEM’s NOx SIP and CAIR and CAMR
compliance plan projects through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation
expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Northern Indiana
anticipates a total capital investment of approximately $510 million. This revised cost estimate
is subject to and pending approval by the IURC. On October 28, 2009, the IURC approved ECR-14 for
recovery of items described above based upon a capital expenditure level (net of accumulated
depreciation) of $271.2 million.

9. Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities

NiSource is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The primary
risks managed by using derivative instruments are commodity price risk and interest rate risk.
Derivative natural gas contracts are entered into to manage the price risk associated with natural
gas price volatility and to secure forward natural gas prices. Interest rate swaps are entered
into to manage interest rate risk associated with NiSource’s fixed-rate borrowings. NiSource
designates many of its commodity forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases of
commodities and designates its interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate borrowings.
Additionally, certain NiSource subsidiaries enter into forward physical contracts with various
third parties to procure or sell natural gas or power. These forward physical contracts are
derivatives which may qualify for the normal purchase and normal sales exception which would not
require mark-to-market accounting.

Accounting Policy for Derivative Instruments.

The ASC topic on accounting for derivatives and
hedging requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, unless such contracts are exempted such as a normal
purchase and normal sale contract under the provisions of the ASC topic. The accounting for
changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and
resulting designation.

NiSource uses a variety of derivative instruments (exchange traded futures and options, physical
forwards and options, basis contracts, financial commodity swaps, and interest rate swaps) to
effectively manage its commodity price risk and interest rate risk exposure. If certain conditions
are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in
the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a
hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. In order for a
derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument
and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed
at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the
hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recognized currently in
earnings. For derivative contracts that qualify for the normal purchase and normal sales
exception, a contract’s fair value is not recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements until
the contract is settled.


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss), regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the
designation of the derivative instrument. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow
hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the
hedged risks. If a forecasted transaction corresponding to a cash flow hedge is no longer probable
to occur, the accumulated gains or losses on the derivative are recognized currently in earnings.
For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period together with the
change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate-making process, the
rate-regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets
and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical
commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or
passed back to customers in revenues through rates. When gains and losses are
recognized in earnings, they are recognized in cost of sales for derivatives that correspond to
commodity risk activities and are recognized in interest expense for derivatives that correspond to
interest-rate risk activities.

Commodity Price Risk Programs.

NiSource and NiSource’s utility customers are exposed to
variability in cash flows associated with natural gas purchases and volatility in natural gas
prices. NiSource purchases natural gas for sale and delivery to its retail, commercial and
industrial customers, and for most customers the variability in the market price of gas is passed
through in their rates. Some of NiSource’s utility subsidiaries offer programs where variability
in the market price of gas is assumed by the respective utility. The objective of NiSource’s
commodity price risk programs is to mitigate this gas cost variability, for NiSource or on behalf
of its customers, associated with natural gas purchases or sales by economically hedging the
various gas cost components by using a combination of futures, options, forward physical contracts,
basis swap contracts or other derivative contract. Northern Indiana also uses derivative contracts
to minimize risk associated with power price volatility. These commodity price risk programs and
their respective accounting treatment are described below.

Northern Indiana, Northern Indiana Fuel and Light, Kokomo Gas, Columbia of Pennsylvania, Columbia
of Kentucky, Columbia of Maryland and Columbia of Virginia use NYMEX derivative contracts to
minimize risk associated with gas price volatility. These derivative programs must be marked to
fair value, but because these derivatives are used within the framework of the companies’ GCR
mechanism, regulatory assets or liabilities are recorded to offset the change in the fair value of
these derivatives.

Northern Indiana, Columbia of Virginia and Columbia of Pennsylvania offer a fixed price program as
an alternative to the standard GCR mechanism. These services provide customers with the
opportunity to either lock in their gas cost or place a cap on the gas costs that would be charged
in future months. In order to hedge the anticipated physical purchases associated with these
obligations, forward physical contracts, NYMEX futures and NYMEX options have been used to secure
forward gas prices. The accounting treatment elected for these contracts is varied whereby certain
of these contracts have been accounted for as cash flow hedges while some contracts are not. The
normal purchase and normal sales exception is elected for forward physical contracts associated
with these programs whereby delivery of the commodity is probable to occur.

Northern Indiana also offers a DependaBill program to its customers as an alternative to the
standard tariff rate that is charged to residential customers. The program allows Northern Indiana
customers to fix their total monthly bill in future months at a flat rate regardless of gas usage
or commodity cost. In order to hedge the anticipated physical purchases associated with these
obligations, forward physical contracts, NYMEX futures and NYMEX options have been used to secure
forward gas prices. The accounting treatment elected for these contracts is varied whereby certain
of these contracts have been accounted for as cash flow hedges while some contracts are not. The
normal purchase and normal sales exception is elected for forward physical contracts associated
with these programs whereby delivery of the commodity is probable to occur.

Northern Indiana enters into gas purchase contracts at first of the month prices that give
counterparties the daily option to either sell an additional package of gas at first of the month
prices or recall the original volume to be delivered. Northern Indiana charges a fee for this
option. The changes in the fair value of these options are primarily due to the changing
expectations of the future intra-month volatility of gas prices. These written options are
derivative instruments, must be marked to fair value and do not meet the requirement for hedge
accounting


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

treatment. However, Northern Indiana records the related gains and losses associated with these
transactions as a regulatory asset or liability.

Columbia of Kentucky, Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia of Maryland
(collectively, the “Columbia LDCs”) enter into contracts that allow counterparties the option to
sell gas to Columbia LDCs at first of the month prices for a particular month of delivery.
Columbia LDCs charge the counterparties a fee for this option. The changes in the fair value of
the options are primarily due to the changing expectations of the future intra-month volatility of
gas prices. These Columbia LDCs defer a portion of the change in the fair value of the options as
either a regulatory asset or liability based on the regulatory customer sharing mechanisms in place, with
the remaining changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings.

As part of the MISO Day 2 initiative, Northern Indiana was allocated or has purchased FTRs. These
FTRs help Northern Indiana offset congestion costs due to the MISO Day 2 activity. The FTRs are
marked to fair value and are not accounted for as a hedge, but since congestion costs are
recoverable through the fuel cost recovery mechanism, the related gains and losses associated with
marking these derivatives to market are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability. In the second
quarter of 2008, MISO changed its allocation procedures from an allocation of FTRs to an allocation
of ARRs, whereby Northern Indiana was allocated ARRs based on its historical use of the MISO
administered transmission system. ARRs entitle the holder to a stream of revenues or charges based
on the price of the associated FTR in the FTR auction. Northern Indiana purchased FTRs in the
second quarter of 2008 and 2009.

NiSource is also involved in commercial and industrial gas sales related to the unregulated natural
gas marketing business, whereby gas derivatives are utilized to hedge expected future gas purchases
and sales. These derivatives associated with commercial and industrial gas sales were previously
accounted for as cash flow hedges. NiSource also has corresponding forward physical sales
contracts of natural gas with customers. These forward physical sales contracts are derivatives
that generally qualify for the normal purchase and normal sales exception, which NiSource had
elected in prior periods, and therefore did not require mark-to-market accounting. In the second
quarter of 2009, NiSource was pursuing the sale of its unregulated natural gas marketing business.
As a result of this decision, certain forecasted transactions were no longer probable to occur,
which triggered the mark-to-market treatment of certain forward sales contracts that were
previously exempt under the normal purchase and normal sale exception. In addition, the
mark-to-market gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related
to certain financial derivatives accounted for as a cash flow hedge were recognized in income from
discontinued operations in the second and third quarter of 2009. NiSource recorded a reserve of
$9.2 million against certain derivatives as of December 31, 2009. This amount represents reserves
related to the creditworthiness of certain customers, fair value of future cash flows, and the cost
of maintaining significant amounts of restricted cash. Refer to Note 4, “Discontinued Operations
and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information. The physical sales contracts marked-to-market had a fair value of
approximately $126.9 million at December 31, 2009, while the financial cash flow hedge contracts
recognized to income in the same period had a fair value loss of $114.6 million.

Interest Rate Risk Activities.

NiSource recognizes that the prudent and selective use of
derivatives may help it to lower its cost of debt capital and manage its interest rate exposure.
NiSource Finance has entered into various “receive fixed” and “pay floating” interest rate swap
agreements which modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long-term debt from
fixed to variable rate. These interest rate swaps also serve to hedge the fair market value of
NiSource Finance’s outstanding debt portfolio. As of December 31, 2009, NiSource had $6.8 billion
of outstanding debt, of which $1,050 million is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a
result of the fixed-to-variable interest rate swap transactions. These interest rate
swaps are designated as fair value hedges. NiSource had no net gain or loss recognized in earnings
due to hedging ineffectiveness from prior years.

On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in a
notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2-year term. NiSource Finance
will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount
based on U.S. 6-month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of
premium at the initial date of the swaps. On September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a
fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of
$110 million.

On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in
a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11-year term. NiSource Finance
will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount
based on U.S. 6-month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of
premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the
swaps on July 15, 2013.

As stated above, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed-to-variable interest
rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110 million. NiSource
Finance elected to terminate the swap when Lehman Holdings Inc., guarantor under the applicable
International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreement, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement
between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. The mark-to-market close-out
value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and
was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. The termination of this swap did not impact
NiSource’s ability to assert hedge accounting for its remaining fixed-to-variable interest rate
swap agreements.

Contemporaneously with the issuance on September 16, 2005 of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes, NiSource
Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six
counterparties. NiSource paid an

aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being
amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense over the term of the
underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88%, respectively. As of
December 31 2009, $14.4 million is in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to forward
starting interest rate swap settlement. These derivative contracts are accounted for as a cash
flow hedge.

For the amounts of realized/unrealized gain (loss) recognized in income on derivatives
disclosed in the table above, losses of $64.4 million and $31.4 million for 2009 and 2008,
respectively, were deferred per regulatory orders. These amounts will be amortized to income over
future periods up to twelve months per regulatory order.

During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash
flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Cost of Sales due to the
probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural
gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No amounts were reclassified in 2008.
It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow
hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in
accumulated other comprehensive loss of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes.

NiSource’s derivative instruments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2009 do not contain any
credit-risk-related contingent features.

Certain NiSource affiliates have physical commodity purchase agreements that meet the definition of
a derivative for which NiSource has elected the normal purchase and normal sale exception. These
agreements are exempt from the requirement of Derivatives and Hedging Accounting, and are not
measured at fair value. Certain of these agreements do contain “ratings triggers” that require
increases in collateral if the credit rating of NiSource or certain of its affiliates are rated
below BBB- by Standard and Poor’s or below Baa3 by Moody’s. As of December 31, 2009, there were no
accounts payables under physical commodity purchase agreements containing ratings triggers.

NiSource had $173.2 million and $285.5 million of cash on deposit with brokers for margin
requirements associated with open derivative positions reflected within, “Restricted cash,” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.

10. Variable Interest Entities and Equity Investments

A. Variable Interest Entities.

A VIE is required to be consolidated by a company if that company
is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the VIE’s activities or is entitled to receive a
majority of the entity’s residual returns. A company that consolidates a VIE is the primary
beneficiary of that entity. In general, a VIE is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other
legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with
voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for
the entity to support its activities. Various disclosures are required about variable interest
entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable
interest.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2004, NiSource has consolidated certain low income housing real
estate investments from which NiSource derives certain tax benefits for its investment. As of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, NiSource increased its long-term debt by approximately $6.3 million and
$12.8 million, respectively, as a result of consolidating these investments. However, this debt is
nonrecourse to NiSource and NiSource’s direct and indirect subsidiaries.

The effective income tax rates were 41.8%, 33.4%, and 35.2% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
The 8.4% increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2009 versus 2008 was the result of certain
nondeductible expenses which increased tax expense by $5.3 million, additional deferred income tax
expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes, and a
reduction in AFUDC-Equity that increased tax expense by $3.2 million. In addition, the effective
tax rate for 2008 was reduced by $14.9 million for the change in Massachusetts state taxes
discussed below. The 1.8% decrease in the overall effective tax rate in 2008 versus 2007 was
primarily the result of the change in Massachusetts state taxes.

During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax
method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and
state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. As a result of the new tax accounting
method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax

receivables of $295.7 million. Refunds of
$263.5 million were received in October 2009, with additional refunds of $25.3 million received in
December 2009 and January and February 2010. The balance of the refunds is expected to be received
before the end of the second quarter of 2010. The tax loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2
million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199
deductions. The impact of certain state’s restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards
resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Governor of Massachusetts signed into law a bill that
significantly changed the Massachusetts corporate income tax regime. Under the new law, which
became effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, NiSource calculates its
Massachusetts income tax liability on a unitary basis, meaning that the income tax obligation to
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is determined based on an apportioned share of all of NiSource’s
income, rather than just the income of NiSource’s subsidiaries doing business in Massachusetts.
Because of NiSource’s substantial operations outside of Massachusetts, the new law had the impact
of reducing the deferred income tax liability to Massachusetts. NiSource recognized the impact of
this tax law change as a $14.9 million reduction in income tax expense in 2008. Income tax expense for 2009 reflects the impact of the new law on a prospective basis.

On December 9, 2008, Columbia Transmission converted from a corporation to a limited liability
company. Under the Internal Revenue Code and most state income tax provisions, limited liability
companies with just one owner are treated as entities that are disregarded as separate from their
owners. As such, for federal and state income tax purposes, Columbia Transmission is treated as a
division of Columbia, its parent corporation. Upon conversion, NiSource recorded additional
deferred tax benefits of $4.6 million on its Consolidated Balance Sheet and in its Statement of
Consolidated Income.

Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. The principal components of
NiSource’s net deferred tax liability were as follows:

Included under Other, net in the table above, are state income tax net operating loss benefits of
$22.7 million and $11.7 million, as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. NiSource
anticipates it is more likely than not that it will realize $21.3 million and $0.4 million of these
benefits as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, prior to their expiration.
As such, a valuation allowance has been recorded of $1.4 million and $11.3 million as of December
31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The $9.9 million reduction in the valuation
allowance from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 is due to the expiration of the 1995 West
Virginia tax net operating loss carryforward period at the end of
2009, offset by additional valuation allowances recorded against the tax

net operating loss carryforward period at the end of 2009, offset by additional valuation allowances
recorded against tax net operating loss benefits originating in 2008 as a result of the tax
accounting method change noted above. The 2008 net operating loss benefits are attributable to
loss carryforwards primarily in the states of Indiana, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Kentucky.
The loss carryforward periods expire in various tax years from 2023 through 2028.

As discussed above, NiSource was granted permission to change its tax method of accounting for
capitalizing certain costs and has taken certain positions related to this change in its 2008
income tax return. NiSource’s determination of what constitutes a capital cost versus ordinary
expense will be reviewed upon audit by the IRS and may be subject to subsequent adjustment. As
such, the status of this tax return position is uncertain at this time. During 2009, NiSource added
$114.4 million to its liability for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions related
to this issue. Offsetting this liability for unrecognized tax benefits are $121.0 million of
related outstanding tax receivables and net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a net asset
of $6.6 million, related to the tax method change issue. NiSource anticipates it will settle the
entire tax position, including interest, at the completion of the IRS audit of the 2008 return.
There have been no other material changes in 2009 to NiSource’s uncertain tax positions recorded as
of December 31, 2008.

The total
amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009,
December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 that, if
recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is
$2.9 million,  $3.5 million and $3.7 million, respectively. As
of December 31, 2008, NiSource did not anticipate any significant changes to its liability for
unrecognized tax benefits over the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, and NiSource does not
anticipate any significant changes to its December 31, 2009 liability for unrecognized tax benefits
over the twelve months ended December 31, 2010.

Effective January 1, 2007, NiSource recognizes accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits,
accrued interest on other income tax liabilities, and tax penalties in income tax expense. With
respect to its unrecognized tax benefits, NiSource recorded $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.3
million in interest expense in the Statement of Consolidated
Income for the periods ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007,
respectively. For the periods ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, NiSource reported
$0.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of accrued interest payable on unrecognized tax
benefits on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. There were no accruals for penalties recorded in the
Statement of Consolidated Income for the periods ended December

31, 2009, December 31, 2008 and
December 31, 2007 and there were no balances for accrued penalties recorded on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008.

NiSource is subject to income taxation in the United States and various state jurisdictions,
primarily Indiana, West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Maryland, Tennessee, New Jersey and New York.

Because NiSource is part of the IRS’s Large and Mid-Size Business program, each year’s federal
income tax return is typically audited by the IRS. As of December 31, 2009, tax years through 2004
have been audited and are closed to further assessment. The audit of tax years 2005, 2006 and 2007
began on December 2, 2009. The statute of limitations for tax year 2005 has been extended to
September 15, 2010. As of December 31, 2008, tax years through 2004 had been audited and closed to
further assessment.

The statute of limitations in each of the state jurisdictions in which NiSource operates remain
open until the years are settled for federal income tax purposes, at which time amended state
income tax returns reflecting all federal income tax adjustments are filed. In March 2009, the
state of Texas issued its audit report for tax periods 2005 through 2007. The state of Mississippi
began its audit of tax years 2004 through 2007 in January 2009, but no audit results have been
provided to date. In June 2009 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania began its audit of tax year 2006,
but no audit results have been provided to date. The state of Indiana began its audit of tax years
2005, 2006 and 2007 in March 2009 and concluded the audit in July 2009. As of December 31, 2008,
there were no state income tax audits in progress other than the state of Texas audit referred to
above.

12. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

NiSource provides defined contribution plans and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans
that covers the majority of its employees. Benefits under the defined benefit retirement plans
reflect the employees’ compensation, years of service and age at retirement. Additionally,
NiSource provides health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. The
majority of employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement age while
working for NiSource. The expected cost of such benefits is accrued during the employees’ years of
service. Current rates of rate-regulated companies include postretirement benefit costs, including
amortization of the regulatory assets that arose prior to inclusion of these costs in rates. For
most plans, cash contributions are remitted to grantor trusts.

NiSource Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans’ Asset Management

.

NiSource employs a
total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to
maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. Risk tolerance is
established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and asset class
volatility. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income
investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as
well as growth, value, small and large capitalizations. Other assets such as private equity and
hedge funds are used judiciously to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio
diversification. Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely
manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of
the underlying assets. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through
quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability
studies.

NiSource utilizes a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and
rebalancing in determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are
studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are analyzed to
ensure that they are consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with
higher volatility generate greater return over the long run. Current market factors such as
inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are
determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and
appropriateness.

The categorization of investments into the asset classes in the table above are based on
definitions established by the NiSource Retirement and Investment Committee. Alternative
investments consist primarily of private equity and hedge fund investments. As of December 31,
2009, $409.9 million of defined benefit pension assets and $24.5 million of other postretirement
benefit assets included in international equities or fixed income asset classes in the table above
would be considered alternative investments, as that term is defined by the AICPA, in addition to
those investments in the alternative investments asset class. As of December 31, 2008, $269.9
million of defined benefit
pension assets and $18.4 million of other postretirement benefit assets included in international
equities or fixed income asset classes in the table above would be considered alternative
investments. Alternative investments are defined in the AICPA practice aid on audit considerations
for alternative investments as investments not listed on national exchanges or over-the-counter
markets, or for which quoted market prices are not available from sources such as financial
publications or the exchanges.

Alternative investment values are based on estimates developed by external investment managers and
subject to a review process performed by management. In making such valuation determinations, the
investment managers


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

consider factors that may include the cost of the investment, developments
since the acquisition of the investment, comparisons to similar publicly traded investments,
subsequent purchases of the same investment by other investors, the current financial position and
operating results of the issuer and such other factors as may be deemed relevant. A range of
possible values exist for these securities, and therefore, the estimated values may differ from the
values that would have been recorded had a ready market for these securities existed.

Fair Value Measurements.

The following table sets forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy,
the Master Trust’s investment assets at fair value as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Assets and
liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. Total Master Trust investment assets at fair value classified
within Level 3 were $287.7 million and $282.7 million as of December 31, 2009 and December 31,
2008, respectively. Such amounts were approximately 15% and 17% of the Master Trust’s total
investments as reported on the statement of net assets available for benefits at fair value as of
December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.

Investments with maturities of three months or less when
purchased are considered  cash equivalents and are normally included in the fair value measurements
 hierarchy as Level 1. Equity securities and mutual funds whose prices are obtained from
quoted prices in active  markets are also classified as Level 1. In cases where equity
securities are not actively  traded, they are reflected as level 2 or level 3 depending on the
specific security and how active the

market is for the respective security. The fair values of most fixed income securities are based on

evaluated prices that reflect observable

market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities, adjusted for observable

differences
and are generally categorized as Level 2. Commingled funds are maintained by
investments companies that hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of
fund objectives, and the values of the majority of these commingled funds are not
publicly quoted and must trade through a broker. Commingled funds that hold underlying
investments that have prices which are derived from the quoted prices in active markets
are classified as Level 2. Commingled funds that hold underlying investments that have
prices which are not derived from the quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level
3. These investments are often valued by investment managers on a periodic basis using
pricing models that use market, income, and cost valuation methods. In addition,
NiSource’s  investments in hedge funds, private equity partnerships, and real estate assets are
also valued by investment managers on a periodic basis using pricing models that use
market, income, and cost valuation methods and are classified as Level 3.

(c)

NiSource determined that for certain rate-regulated subsidiaries the future recovery of pension
and other postretirement benefits costs is probable. These rate-regulated subsidiaries recorded
regulatory assets and liabilities of $980.7 million and $1.4 million, respectively, as of December
31, 2009, and $1,094.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2008 that would otherwise
have been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

NiSource’s accumulated benefit obligation for its pension plans was $2,295.3 million and $2,085.5
million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation as of
a date is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to
employee service rendered prior to that date and based on current and past compensation levels.
The accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation disclosed in the
table above in that it includes no assumptions about future compensation levels.

NiSource’s pension plans were underfunded by $674.5 million at December 31, 2009 compared to being
underfunded at December 31, 2008 by $712.5 million. The improvement in funded status was due
primarily to favorable returns on plan assets in 2009, partially offset by a decrease in discount
rate from the prior measurement date. NiSource contributed $102.9 million and $5.8 million to its
pension plans in 2009 and 2008, respectively.

NiSource’s funded status for its other postretirement benefit plans improved by $58.1 million to an
unfunded status of $444.7 million due primarily to favorable asset returns partially offset by a
decrease in discount rate from the prior measurement date. NiSource contributed approximately
$60.8 million and $50.6 million to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2009 and 2008,
respectively. No amounts of NiSource’s pension or other postretirement plans’ assets are expected
to be returned to NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in 2010.

The following table provides the key assumptions that were used to calculate the pension and other
postretirement benefits obligations for NiSource’s various plans as of December 31.

$44.9 million in 2008. For 2009 and 2008, pension and other postretirement benefit cost of
approximately $65.4 million and income of $6.2 million, respectively, was capitalized as a

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Considering the turmoil in the financial markets during 2008, NiSource believes it is appropriate
to assume an 8.75% rate of return on pension plan assets for its calculation of 2009 pension
benefits cost. This is primarily based on revised historical rates of return.

13. Authorized Classes of Cumulative Preferred and Preference Stocks

NiSource has 20,000,000 authorized shares of Preferred with a $0.01 par value, of which 4,000,000
shares are designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares.

The authorized classes of par value and no par value cumulative preferred and preference stocks of
Northern Indiana are as follows: 2,400,000 shares of Cumulative Preferred with a $100 par value;
3,000,000 shares of Cumulative Preferred with no par value; 2,000,000 shares of Cumulative
Preference with a $50 par value; and 3,000,000 shares of Cumulative Preference with no par value.

As of December 31, 2009, NiSource and Northern Indiana had no preferred shares outstanding.

14. Common Stock

As of December 31, 2009, NiSource had 400,000,000 authorized shares of common stock with a $0.01
par value.

A. Common Stock Dividend.

Holders of shares of NiSource’s common stock are entitled to receive
dividends when, and if declared by the Board out of funds legally available. The policy of the
Board has been to declare cash dividends on a quarterly basis payable on or about the 20th day of
February, May, August and November. NiSource has paid quarterly common dividends totaling $0.92
per share for the 2009, 2008 and 2007


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

years. By unanimous written consent dated January 19, 2010, the Board declared a quarterly common
dividend of $0.23 per share, payable on February 19, 2010 to holders of record on January 29, 2010.

B. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan.

NiSource offers a Dividend Reinvestment and
Stock Purchase Plan which allows participants to reinvest dividends and make voluntary cash
payments to purchase additional shares of common stock on the open market.

15. Share-Based Compensation

NiSource currently issues long-term incentive grants to key management employees under a long-term
incentive plan approved by stockholders on April 13, 1994 (1994 Plan). The 1994 Plan, as amended
and restated, permits the following types of grants, separately or in combination: nonqualified
stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock units, contingent stock units and dividend equivalents payable on grants of
options, performance units and contingent stock awards.

At December 31, 2009, there were 27,539,431 shares reserved for future awards under the amended and
restated 1994 Plan.

NiSource recognized stock-based employee compensation expense of $9.6 million, $9.5 million and
$4.4 million during the years of 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as well as related tax benefits
of $4.0 million, $3.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2009, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested
awards amounted to $9.8 million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining
requisite service period of 1.8 years.

Stock Options.

Option grants are granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high
and low market price on the day of the grant. The weighted average remaining contractual life of
the options outstanding and exercisable is 3.2 years. Stock option transactions for the year
ended December 31, 2009 are as follows:

No options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007.

Restricted Stock Awards

. In 2009, NiSource granted restricted stock units of 335,068, subject to
service conditions. The total grant date fair value of the restricted units was $2.5 million,
based on the average market price of NiSource’s common stock at the date of each grant less the
present value of dividends not received during the vesting period, which will be expensed, net of
forfeitures, over the vesting period of approximately three years. The service conditions for
313,568 units lapse on January 31, 2012 when 100% of the shares vest. If before January 31, 2012,
the employee terminates employment (1) due to retirement, having attained age 55 and completed ten
years of service, or (2) due to death or disability, the employment conditions will lapse with
respect to a pro rata portion of the restricted units on the date of termination. Termination due
to any other reason will result in all restricted units
awarded being forfeited effective the employee’s date of termination. Employees will be entitled
to receive dividends upon vesting. The service conditions lapse from the remaining 21,500 units
between August 1, 2012 and June 1, 2014. As of December 31, 2009, 332,605 nonvested restricted
stock units were granted and outstanding for the 2009 award.


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

In 2008, NiSource granted restricted stock units of 244,907, subject to service conditions. The
total grant date fair value of the restricted units was $3.7 million, based on the average market
price of NiSource’s common stock at the date of each grant less the present value of dividends not
received during the vesting period, which will be expensed, net of forfeitures, over the vesting
period of approximately three years. The service conditions for 208,609 awards lapse on January
31, 2011. If before January 31, 2011, the employee terminates employment (1) due to retirement,
having attained age 55 and completed ten years of service, or (2) due to death or disability, the
employment conditions will lapse with respect to a pro rata portion of the restricted units on the
date of termination. Termination due to any other reason will result in all restricted units
awarded being forfeited effective the employee’s date of termination. Employees will be entitled
to receive dividends upon vesting. The remaining 36,298 awards vest evenly over a three year
period ending December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2009, 218,898 nonvested restricted stock units
were granted and outstanding for the 2008 award.

Time-accelerated Awards.

NiSource awarded restricted shares and restricted stock units that contain
provisions for time-accelerated vesting to key executives under the 1994 Plan. Most of these
awards were issued in January 2003 and January 2004. These awards of restricted stock or
restricted stock units generally vest over a period of six years or, in the case of restricted
stock units, at age 62 if an employee would become age 62 within six years, but not less than three
years. If certain predetermined criteria involving measures of total shareholder return are met,
as measured at the end of the third year after the grant date, the awards vest at the end of the
third year. At December 31, 2009, NiSource had 265,137 nonvested awards which contain the
time-accelerated provisions. The total shareholder return measures established for the 2003 and
2004 awards were not met; therefore these grants did not have an accelerated vesting period.

that contain provisions for time-accelerated vesting for the year ended December 31, 2009:

Contingent Share Awards.

In 2009, NiSource granted 940,707 contingent stock units subject to
performance conditions. The grant date fair-value of the awards was $7.0 million, based on the
average market price of NiSource’s common stock at the date of each grant less the present value of
dividends not received during the vesting period which will be expensed, net of forfeitures, over
the three year requisite service period. The performance conditions are based on achievement of
non-GAAP financial measures: cumulative net operating earnings, that NiSource defines as income
from continuing operations adjusted for certain items; cumulative funds from operations that
NiSource defines as net operating cash flows provided by continuing operations; and total debt that
NiSource defines as total debt adjusted for significant movement in natural gas prices and other
adjustments determined by the Board. The service conditions lapse on January 31, 2012 when 100% of
the shares vest. If the employee terminates employment before January 31, 2012 (1) due to
retirement, having attained age 55 and completed ten years of service, or (2) due to death or
disability, the employment conditions will lapse with respect to a pro rata portion of the
contingent units on the date of termination. Termination due to any other reason will result in
all contingent units awarded being forfeited effective the employee’s date of termination.
Employees will be

entitled to receive dividends upon vesting. As of December 31, 2009, 933,318 nonvested contingent
stock units were granted and outstanding for the 2009 award.

In 2008, NiSource granted 417,196 contingent stock units subject to performance conditions. The
total grant date fair value of the awards was $6.2 million, based on the average market price of
NiSource’s common stock at the date of each grant less the present value of dividends not received
during the vesting period, which will be expensed, net of forfeitures, over the vesting period of
approximately three years. The performance conditions are based on achievement of non-GAAP
financial measures (cumulative net operating earnings and cumulative funds from operations). Per
the agreement, to the extent base performance conditions are exceeded during the three year
performance period, the award will be increased in increments of 10% up to 50%. If prior to the
lapse of the performance conditions, the employee terminates employment (1) due to retirement,
having attained age 55 and completed ten years of service, (2) due to disability, or (3) due to
death with less than or equal to 12 months remaining in the performance period, the employee will
receive a pro rata portion of the contingent shares if the performance conditions have been met.
If prior to the lapse of the performance conditions, the employee terminates
employment due to death with more than 12 months remaining in the performance period, the employee
will receive a pro rata portion of the contingent shares as if the performance conditions had been
met. Termination due to any other reason will result in all contingent shares awarded being
forfeited effective the employee’s date of termination. Employees will be entitled to receive
dividends upon vesting. During the fourth quarter of 2009 it became probable that the performance
condition would not be met for one half of the award. Expense related to this portion of the award
was reversed in the fourth quarter and will no longer be amortized going forward. Also during the
fourth quarter of 2009 it became probable that the base performance condition would be exceeded for
one half of the award, thereby increasing the number of shares probable to be issued upon vesting
by 50% for this portion of the award. Additional expense related to the increase in probable
shares was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2009 and will continue to be amortized over the
remainder of the vesting period. As of December 31, 2009, 417,196 nonvested contingent stock units
were granted and outstanding for the 2008 award.

In March 2007, 320,330 contingent stock units were granted. The grant date fair value of the award
was $6.8 million, based on the average market price of NiSource’s common stock at the date of grant
less the present value of dividends not received during the vesting period, which will be expensed
net of forfeitures over the vesting period of approximately three years. The shares are subject to
both performance and service conditions. The performance conditions were based on achievement of a
non-GAAP financial measure as described above. Per the agreement, to the extent base performance
conditions were exceeded, the award would be increased in increments of 10% up to 50%. If the
performance conditions were not met, the grants would be cancelled and the shares would be
forfeited. Subsequent to meeting the performance conditions, an additional two year service period
will then be required before the shares vest on December 31, 2009. If after completing the
performance conditions but prior to completing the service conditions the employee terminates
employment (1) due to retirement, having attained age 55 and completed ten years of service, or (2)
due to death or disability, the employment conditions will lapse with respect to a pro rata portion
of the contingent shares on the date of termination. Termination due to any other reason will
result in all contingent shares awarded being forfeited effective the employee’s date of
termination. Employees will be entitled to receive dividends upon vesting. During
2007, base performance conditions were exceeded, resulting in an increase of the number of shares
to be issued upon vesting by 20%. Accordingly, 62,319 additional shares were granted in January
2008. As of December 31, 2009, all contingent shares have vested for the 2007 award.

had been issued under the Plan.

16. Long-Term Debt

NiSource Finance is a wholly-owned, consolidated finance subsidiary of NiSource that engages in
financing activities to raise funds for the business operations of NiSource and its subsidiaries.
NiSource Finance was incorporated in February 2000 under the laws of the state of Indiana.
NiSource Finance and Capital Markets’ obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by
NiSource. Consequently no separate financial statements for NiSource Finance or Capital Markets
are required to be reported. No other NiSource subsidiaries guarantee debt.

During 2009, NiSource successfully executed its financing and liquidity plan through the following
activities:

During August 2008, after a series of negative events in the tax-exempt auction rate market,
Northern Indiana converted its Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds, having a total principal
value of $254 million, from variable rate demand mode to fixed rate demand mode. The weighted
average interest rate is now fixed at 5.58%.

During July 2008, Northern Indiana redeemed $24.0 million of its medium-term notes, with an average
interest rate of 6.80%.

On May 15, 2008, NiSource Finance issued $500.0 million of 6.80% unsecured notes that mature
January 15, 2019 and $200.0 million of 6.15% unsecured notes that mature on March 1, 2013. The
notes due in 2013 constitute a further issuance of the $345.0 million 6.15% notes issued February
19, 2003, and form a single series having an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $545.0
million.

unamortized premium and discount on long-term debt, and exclude the debt of certain low-income
housing real estate investments, as NiSource does not guarantee the long-term debt payment of these
entities. Under the provisions of ASC Topic 810 — Consolidation, the low-income housing real
estate investments were required to be consolidated beginning in the first quarter of 2004.

Unamortized debt expense, premium and discount on long-term debt applicable to outstanding bonds
are being amortized over the lives of such bonds. Reacquisition premiums have been deferred and
are being amortized. These premiums are not earning a regulatory return during the recovery
period.

Of NiSource’s long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2009, $109.0 million was issued by
NiSource’s affiliate, Capital Markets. The financial obligations of Capital Markets are subject to
a Support Agreement between NiSource and Capital Markets, under which NiSource has committed to
make payments of interest and principal on Capital Markets’ obligations in the event of a failure
to pay by Capital Markets. Under the terms of the Support Agreement, in addition to the cash flow
from cash dividends paid to NiSource by any of its consolidated subsidiaries, the assets of
NiSource, other than the stock and assets of Northern Indiana, are available as recourse for the
benefit of Capital Markets’ creditors. The carrying value of the NiSource assets, excluding the
assets of Northern Indiana, was $14.0 billion at December 31, 2009.

NiSource Finance has entered into interest rate swap agreements for $1,050 million of its
outstanding long-term debt. The effect of these agreements is to modify the interest rate
characteristics of a portion of their respective long-term debt from fixed to variable. Refer to
Note 9, “Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information regarding interest rate swaps.

NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five-year revolving credit facility. This
covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A
similar covenant in the 2005 private placement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to
capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2009, the ratio was 58.3%.

NiSource is also subject to certain other non-financial covenants under the revolving credit
facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on
NiSource’s assets, generally exempting liens on
utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional
subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease
and/or transfer of NiSource’s assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and
dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of
that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the
revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a
material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also include a cross-default provision,
which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment
default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount
of $50 million or more.

NiSource’s indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However,
NiSource’s indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured
payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on
NiSource’s assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests,
preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSource’s
consolidated net tangible assets.

17. Short-Term Borrowings

NiSource Finance maintains a $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of
banks which has a termination date of July 7, 2011. This facility provides a reasonable cushion of
short-term liquidity for general corporate purposes including meeting cash requirements driven by
volatility in natural gas prices, as well as provides for the issuance of letters of credit.
During September 2008, NiSource Finance entered into an additional $500 million six-month revolving
credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital that was originally due to
expire on March 23, 2009. However, on February 13, 2009, the six-month credit facility was
terminated in conjunction with the closing of a new two-year bank term loan.

As of December 31, 2009, NiSource had $85.0 million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding under
its five-year revolving credit facility. NiSource Finance maintains a five-year revolving line of
credit with a syndicate of financial institutions which can be used either for borrowings or the
issuance of letters of credit.

Short-term borrowings were as follows:

A. Fair Value Measurements.

NiSource adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820 — Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures for financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008 and
non-financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2009. There was no impact on retained earnings
as a result of the adoption.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements.

Price risk management assets and liabilities include commodity exchange-traded and
non-exchange-based derivative contracts. Exchange-traded derivative contracts are generally based
on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial
assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance
risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non-exchange-traded derivatives are
valued using broker or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges. In such cases, these
non-exchange-traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non-exchange-based derivative
instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may
utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments.
Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and
market-corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable
market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially
the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain
derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and
models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the
measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in
the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange-traded. Credit
exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures.

To determine the fair value of derivatives associated with NiSource’s unregulated natural gas
marketing business, certain reserves were calculated. These reserves were primarily determined by
evaluating the credit worthiness of certain customers, fair value of future cash flows, and the
cost of maintaining restricted cash. Refer to Note 9, “Risk Management and Energy Marketing
Activities” for additional information on price risk assets.

Price risk management assets also include fixed-to-floating interest-rate swaps, which are
designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable-rate debt as
a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future
outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current
fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well
as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are
based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest-rate swaps are
categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value
calculation of the interest rate swap.

Available-for-sale securities are investments pledged as collateral for trust accounts related to
NiSource’s wholly-owned insurance company. Available-for-sale securities are included within
“Other investments” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Securities classified within Level 1
include U.S. Treasury debt securities which are highly liquid and are actively traded in
over-the-counter markets. NiSource values corporate and mortgage-backed debt securities using a
matrix pricing model that incorporates market-based information. These securities trade less
frequently and are classified within Level 2. Unrealized gains and losses from available-for-sale
securities are
included in other comprehensive income. The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and
fair value of available-for-sale debt securities at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were:

For the year ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 the realized gain (loss) on sale of
available for sale U.S. Treasury debt securities was $1.1 million, $2.7 million and $0.5 million,
respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 the realized gain (loss) on
sale of available for sale Corporate/Other bond debt securities was $0.9 million, ($0.3) million,
and ($0.3) million. The cost of maturities sold is based upon specific identification. At
December 31, 2009, all U.S Treasury securities have maturities of greater than one year. At
December 31, 2009 approximately $3.9 million of Corporate/Other bonds have maturities of less than
a year while the remaining securities have maturities of greater than one year.

As part of the MISO Day 2 initiative, Northern Indiana was allocated or has purchased FTRs.
These rights help Northern Indiana offset congestion costs due to the MISO Day 2 activity. These
instruments are considered derivatives and are valued utilizing forecasted congestion source and
sink prices in the Day Ahead market. Any unrealized gains and losses for FTRs are attributable to
a change in this model of forecasted congestion. They are classified as Level 3 and reflected in the table above. The FTRs are not accounted for as a hedge,
but since congestion costs are recoverable through the fuel cost recovery mechanism, the related
gains and losses associated with marking these derivatives to market are recorded as a regulatory
asset or liability. Northern Indiana also writes options for regulatory incentive purposes which
are also considered Level 3 valuations. Realized gains and losses for these Level 3 recurring
items are included in income within, Cost of Sales, on the Statements of Consolidated Income.
Unrealized gains and losses from Level 3 recurring items are included within, Regulatory assets or
Regulatory liabilities, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements.

For 2009, NiSource recognized $16.6 million in expense for
an impairment charge related to the assets of Lake Erie Land discussed in Note 3, “Impairments,
Restructuring and Other Charges.” The total impairment charge is comprised of $8.8 million
recognized due to the uncollectability of certain receivables due from the original developer of
the property and $7.8 million recognized due to the current book value exceeding the estimated fair
value of certain real estate property. The fair value of the assets was based upon the appraised
value of certain real estate property. These measurements are considered Level 3 valuations as
several of the inputs used in the appraisal were unobservable. In prior reporting periods, the
assets of Lake Erie Land were measured based on the purchase price contained in the purchase
agreement entered into with the original developer in 2005.

NDC Douglas Properties, a subsidiary of NiSource Development Company, is in the process of exiting
some of its low income housing investments. During the third quarter of 2009 a potential buyer was
able to secure financing to purchase two properties previously recorded as assets held for sale as
well as three additional properties. The expected proceeds from the sale of the five properties
were less than the net book value resulting in a pre-tax impairment charge of $4.5 million
recognized during the third quarter. The NDC Douglas Properties assets were valued based on the
anticipated adjusted purchase price included in the letter of intent which is an unobservable input
and is considered a Level 3 valuation.

NDC Douglas Properties owns four properties which do not currently meet the assets held for sale
criteria as their estimated sale date is greater than one year. Based on previous impairments
recorded on other NDC Douglas Properties, the properties were tested for impairment during the
third quarter of 2009. The test resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $4.4 million recognized
during the third quarter. The assets were valued based on a discounted cash flow model utilizing
estimated future cash flows which are unobservable inputs. The valuation is considered a Level 3
valuation.

The following table presents long-lived assets measured and recorded at fair value on NiSource’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet on a non-recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy

B. Other Fair Value Disclosures for Financial Instruments.

NiSource has certain financial
instruments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but nevertheless are recorded
at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature, including cash and
cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, customer deposits and
short-term borrowings. NiSource’s long-term borrowings are recorded at historical amounts unless
designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of
financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.

Investments.

NiSource has corporate owned life insurance which is measured and recorded at cash
surrender value. NiSource’s investments in corporate owned life insurance at December 31, 2009 and
2008 were $23.7 million and $17.7 million.

Long-term Debt.

The fair values of these securities are estimated based on the quoted market
prices for the same or similar issues or on the rates offered for securities of the same remaining
maturities. Certain premium costs associated with the early settlement of long-term debt are not
taken into consideration in determining fair value.

On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse,
substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originated, to CORC, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, was party to an agreement with Dresdner Bank AG, also dated
May 14, 2004, under the terms of which it sold an undivided percentage ownership interest in the
accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. On October 1, 2009, CORC and Commerzbank AG
(successor to Dresdner Bank AG) terminated their agreement, while Columbia of Ohio and CORC
concurrently terminated their agreement. In conjunction with the termination of the sales

exchange for rights in the receivables held by Commerzbank AG.

On October 23, 2009, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse,
substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CGORC, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Columbia of Ohio. CGORC, in turn, is party to an agreement with BTMU, also dated October 23,
2009, under the terms of which it sells an undivided

percentage ownership interest in its accounts
receivable to a commercial paper conduit sponsored by BTMU. The maximum seasonal program limit
under the terms of the agreement is $275 million. CGORC’s agreement with the commercial paper
conduit has a scheduled termination date of October 22, 2010, and can be renewed if mutually agreed
to by both parties. As of December 31, 2009, $88.4 million of accounts receivable had been sold by
CGORC. CGORC is a separate corporate entity from NiSource and Columbia of Ohio, with its own
separate obligations, and upon a liquidation of CGORC, CGORC’s obligations must be satisfied out of
CGORC’s assets prior to any value becoming available to CGORC’s stockholder. Under the agreement,
it is an event of termination if NiSource’s debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard and Poor’s
or Moody’s or falls below BB- or Ba3 at either Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s, respectively.

On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of
its trade receivables, as they originated, to NRC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana.
NRC, in turn, was party to an agreement with Citibank, N.A. under the terms of which it sold an
undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit.
On May 20, 2009, NRC and Citibank, North America, Inc. terminated their agreement while Northern
Indiana and NRC concurrently terminated their agreement. In conjunction with the termination of
the sales agreement on May 20, 2009, Northern Indiana made a payment of $65.3 million to Citibank,
N.A. in exchange for rights in the receivables held by Citibank, N.A.

On October 23, 2009, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse,
substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NARC, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Northern Indiana. NARC, in turn, is party to an agreement with RBS, also dated October 23,
2009, under the terms of which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in its accounts
receivable to a commercial paper conduit sponsored by RBS. The maximum seasonal program limit
under the terms of the agreement is $200 million. NARC’s agreement with the commercial paper
conduit has a scheduled termination date of October 22, 2010, and can be renewed if mutually agreed
to by both parties. As of December 31, 2009, $100.0 million of accounts receivable had been sold
by NARC. NARC is a separate corporate entity from NiSource and Northern Indiana, with its own
separate obligations, and upon a liquidation of NARC, NARC’s obligations must be satisfied out of
NARC’s assets prior to any value becoming available to NARC’s stockholder. Under the agreement, it
is an event of termination if Northern Indiana’s debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard and
Poor’s or Moody’s or falls below BB, or Ba2 at either Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s,
respectively.

NiSource’s accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting based upon the conditions
met in ASC Topic 860 — Transfers and Servicing. In the agreements, all transferred assets have
been isolated from the originator and put presumptively beyond the reach of the originator and its
creditors. The originators do not retain any interest in the sold receivables.

All accounts receivables sold to the commercial paper conduits are valued at face value, which
approximate fair value due to its short-term nature. The amount of the undivided percentage
ownership interest in the accounts receivables sold is determined in part by required loss reserves
under the agreements.

Beginning January 1, 2010, transfers of accounts receivable that previously qualified for
sales accounting will be recorded as debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum amount
of debt that could be recorded related to NiSource’s accounts receivable programs is $475 million.

Guarantees of Subsidiaries Debt.

NiSource has guaranteed the payment of $6.1 billion of debt for
various wholly-owned subsidiaries including NiSource Finance, and through a support agreement,
Capital Markets, which is reflected on NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The subsidiaries
are required to comply with certain financial covenants under the debt indenture and in the event
of default, NiSource would be obligated to pay the debt’s principal and related interest. NiSource
does not anticipate its subsidiaries will have any difficulty maintaining compliance.

Guarantees Supporting Commodity Transactions of Subsidiaries.

NiSource has issued guarantees,
which support up to approximately $444.4 million of commodity-related payments for its current
subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to
counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and
electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity-related contracts subject to
these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Lines and Letters of Credit.

NiSource Finance maintains a $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit
facility with a syndicate of banks which has a termination date of July 7, 2011. This facility
provides a reasonable cushion of


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

short-term liquidity for general corporate purposes including meeting cash requirements driven by
volatility in natural gas prices, as well as provides for the issuance of letters of credit.
During September 2008, NiSource Finance entered into an additional $500 million six-month revolving
credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital that was originally due to
expire on March 23, 2009. However, on February 13, 2009, the six-month credit facility was
terminated in conjunction with the closing of a new two-year bank term loan. At December 31, 2009,
NiSource had $103.0 million in short-term borrowings outstanding under its credit facility and had
issued stand-by letters of credit of approximately $87.8 million for the benefit of third parties.

Other Guarantees or Obligations.

On June 30, 2008, NiSource sold Whiting Clean Energy to BPAE for
$216.7 million which included $16.1 million in working capital. The agreement with BPAE contains
representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions. NiSource has executed purchase and
sales agreement guarantees totaling $220 million which guarantee performance of PEI’s covenants,
agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreement with BPAE.
No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009.

NiSource has additional purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $30.0 million, which
guarantee performance of the seller’s covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities,
representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales
agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that
the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses
associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote.

On August 29, 2007, Millennium entered into a bank credit agreement to finance the construction of
the Millennium pipeline project. As a condition precedent to the credit agreement, NiSource issued
a guarantee securing payment for 47.5%, its indirect ownership interest percentage, of amounts
borrowed under the credit agreement up until such time as the amounts payable under the agreement
are paid in full. As of December 31, 2009, Millennium owed $798.9 million under the financing
agreements, of which NiSource guaranteed $379.5 million. NiSource recorded an accrued liability of
approximately $7.6 million related to the fair value of this guarantee. The permanent financing
for Millennium is expected to be completed during 2010. In the interim, Millennium will continue
to be funded by the $800 million credit agreement, which extends through August 2010.

On June 29, 2006, Columbia Transmission, Piedmont, and Hardy Storage entered into multiple
agreements to finance the construction of the Hardy Storage project, which is accounted for by
NiSource as an equity investment. Under the financing agreement, Columbia Transmission issued
guarantees securing payment for 50% of any amounts issued in connection with Hardy Storage up until
such time as the project is placed in service and operated within certain specified parameters. As
of December 31, 2009, Hardy Storage borrowed $123.4 million under the financing agreement, for
which Columbia Transmission recorded an accrued liability of approximately $1.2 million related to
the fair value of its guarantee securing payment for $61.7 million which is 50% of the amount
borrowed. NiSource expects Hardy Storage to satisfy certain terms of its financing during 2010 in
order that the underlying guarantee will no longer be required.

NiSource has issued other guarantees supporting derivative related payments associated with
interest rate swap agreements issued by NiSource Finance, operating leases for many of its
subsidiaries and for other agreements entered into by its current and former subsidiaries.

B. Other Legal Proceedings.

In the normal course of its business, NiSource and its subsidiaries
have been named as defendants in various legal proceedings. In the opinion of management, the
ultimate disposition of these currently asserted claims will not have a material adverse impact on
NiSource’s consolidated financial position.

Tawney, et al. v. Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., Roane County, WV Circuit Court

The Plaintiffs, who are West Virginia landowners, filed a lawsuit in early 2003 in the West
Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County, West Virginia (the “Trial Court”) against CNR alleging
that CNR underpaid royalties on gas produced on their land by improperly deducting post-production
costs and not paying a fair value for the gas. Plaintiffs also claimed that Defendants
fraudulently concealed the deduction of post-production charges. In December 2004, the Trial Court
granted Plaintiffs’ motion to add NiSource and Columbia as Defendants. The Trial Court later
certified the case as a class action that includes any person who, after July 31, 1990, received or
is due


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

royalties from CNR (and its predecessors or successors) on lands lying within the boundary of the
state of West Virginia. Although NiSource sold CNR in 2003, NiSource remained obligated to manage
this litigation and was responsible for the majority of any damages awarded to Plaintiffs. On
January 27, 2007, the jury hearing the case returned a verdict against all Defendants in the amount
of $404.3 million inclusive of both compensatory and punitive damages; Defendants subsequently
filed their Petition for Appeal, which was later amended, with the West Virginia Supreme Court of
Appeals (the “Appeals Court”), which refused the petition on May 22, 2008. On August 22, 2008,
Defendants filed Petitions to the United States Supreme Court for writ of certiorari. Given the
Appeals Court’s earlier refusal of the appeal, NiSource adjusted its reserve in the second quarter
of 2008 to reflect the portion of the Trial Court judgment for which NiSource would be responsible,
inclusive of interest. This amount was included in “Legal and environmental reserves,” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008. On October 24, 2008, the Trial Court
preliminarily approved a Settlement Agreement with a total settlement amount of $380 million. The
settlement received final approval by the Trial Court on November 22, 2008. NiSource’s share of
the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the
Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009.
Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254
million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement,
which has since been drawn down as settlement payments have been made. The Trial Court entered its
Order discharging the judgment on January 20, 2009 and is supervising the administration of the
settlement proceeds. As of December 31, 2009, NiSource has contributed a total of $277.3 million
into the qualified settlement fund, $25 million of which was contributed in 2008. As of December
31, 2009, $61.5 million of the maximum settlement liability has not been paid. NiSource has since
contributed  an additional $18.0 million. The remaining balance of the letter of
credit is sufficient to cover any remaining payments under the Settlement Agreement. NiSource will
be required to make additional payments, pursuant to the settlement, upon notice from the Class
Administrator.

John Thacker, et al. v. Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C., U.S. District Court, E.D. Kentucky

Poplar Creek Development Company v. Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C., U.S. District Court, E.D. Kentucky

On February 8, 2007, Plaintiff filed the Thacker case, a purported class action alleging that
Chesapeake has failed to pay royalty owners the correct amounts pursuant to the provisions of their
oil and gas leases covering real property located within the state of Kentucky. Columbia has
assumed the defense of Chesapeake in this matter pursuant to the provisions of the Stock Purchase
Agreement dated July 3, 2003, among Columbia, NiSource, and Triana Energy Holding, Inc.,
Chesapeake’s predecessor in interest (“Stock Purchase Agreement”). Plaintiffs filed an Amended
Complaint on March 19, 2007, which, among other things, added NiSource and Columbia as Defendants.
On March 31, 2008, the Court denied a Motion by Defendants to Dismiss and on June 3, 2008, the
Plaintiffs moved to certify a class consisting of all persons entitled to payment of royalty by
Chesapeake under leases operated by Chesapeake at any point after February 5, 1992, on real
property in Kentucky.

In June 2009, the parties to the Thacker litigation presented a Settlement Agreement to the Court
for preliminary approval. The court granted the Motion for Preliminary approval and held a
fairness hearing on November 10, 2009. NiSource is awaiting the Court’s decision.

On October 9, 2008, Chesapeake tendered the Poplar Creek case to Columbia and Columbia
conditionally assumed the defense of this matter pursuant to the provisions of the Stock Purchase
Agreement. Poplar Creek also purports to be a class action covering royalty owners in the state of
Kentucky and alleges that Chesapeake has improperly deducted costs from the royalty payments; thus
there is some overlap of parties and issues between the Poplar Creek and Thacker cases. Chesapeake
filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings in December 2008, which was granted on July 2, 2009.
Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the 6

th

Circuit Court of Appeals.

Environmental Protection Agency Notice of Violation

On September 29, 2004, the EPA issued an NOV to Northern Indiana for alleged violations of the
CAA and the Indiana SIP. The NOV alleges that modifications were made to certain boiler units
at three of Northern Indiana’s generating stations between the years 1985 and 1995 without
obtaining appropriate air permits for the modifications. The ultimate resolution could
require additional capital expenditures and operations and maintenance costs as well as
payment of substantial penalties and development of supplemental environmental projects.
Northern Indiana is


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

currently in discussions with the EPA regarding possible resolutions to this NOV. Although
penalties have been proposed and a reserve has been recorded for the matter, Northern Indiana is
unable to predict the outcome of this matter at this time.

C. Tax Matters.

NiSource records liabilities for potential income tax assessments. The accruals
relate to tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on management’s estimate
of the ultimate resolution of these positions. These liabilities may be affected by changing
interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, or the expiration of the statute of
limitations. NiSource is a part of the IRS’s Large and Mid-Size Business program. As a result,
each year’s federal income tax return is typically audited by the IRS. The audits of all tax years
through 2004 have been completed and are closed to further assessment. The IRS audit of years
2005, 2006 and 2007 began on December 2, 2009. In March 2009, the state of Texas issued its audit
report for tax periods 2005 through 2007. The state of Mississippi began its audit of tax years
2004 through 2007 in January 2009, but no audit results have been provided to date. In June, 2009,
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania began its audit of tax year 2006, but no audit results have been
provided to date. The state of Indiana began its audit of tax years 2005, 2006 and 2007 in March
2009 and concluded the audit in July, 2009.

NiSource is currently being audited for sales and use tax compliance in the states of Virginia,
Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maine, New York, Louisiana and Indiana.

D. Environmental Matters.

NiSource operations are subject to complex, interlocking and changing environmental statutes and
regulations related to air quality, water quality, hazardous waste and solid waste. NiSource
believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently
applicable to its operations and believes that it has all necessary permits to conduct our
operations.

Air

The actions listed below could require further reductions in emissions from various emission
sources. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in these matters.

Climate Change.

On June 26, 2009, the United States House of Representatives passed a climate
change bill called ACES. The comprehensive bill proposes a GHG cap and trade system starting in
2012 for electrical suppliers, 2014 for natural gas transmission companies, and 2016 for natural
gas distribution companies. The cap and trade system would establish economy-wide reduction
targets of 3% by 2012 and 83% by 2050. ACES would allocate natural gas distribution companies and
electric suppliers a certain number of emission allowances without charge, but these allocations
would decrease over time, phasing out entirely by 2030. Gas transmission companies would not
receive any emission allowances under ACES. ACES also contains renewable energy standards, which
would require retail electric suppliers to provide a portion of their power from renewable sources
and mandates performance standards for particular sources. The Senate has been considering its own
renewable energy standard and climate change bills.

If ACES or other Federal comprehensive climate change bills were to pass both Houses of Congress
and be enacted into law, the impact on NiSource’s financial performance would depend on a number of
factors, including the overall level of required GHG reductions, the renewable energy targets, the
degree to which offsets may be used for compliance, the amount of recovery allowed from customers,
and the extent to which NiSource would be entitled to receive free CO


allowances.
ACES, Kerry-Boxer, or other Federal legislation could result in additional expense or compliance
costs that may not be fully recoverable from customers and could materially impact NiSource’s
financial results.

The EPA is also taking action to regulate GHGs under the CAA. On December 7, 2009, the EPA made
the following findings: (a) that GHGs in the atmosphere endanger the public health and welfare
within the meaning of the CAA and (b) that emissions from new motor vehicles contribute to the mix
of GHGs in the atmosphere. It is the EPA’s position that this “endangerment” finding, along with
some other recent regulatory developments, will trigger permitting requirements for large
industrial sources of GHGs. On October 27, 2009, the EPA issued proposed regulations, commonly
called the “tailoring rule,” applicable to the two CAA programs, New Source Review and Title V
permitting for sources that emit greater than 25,000 tons per year of GHGs. Under the proposal,
large


ITEM 8.

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

stationary sources could be required to install Best Available Control Technology, to be determined
on a case-by-case basis. The total cost impact of EPA regulation of GHG under the CAA cannot be
determined at this time.

National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

The CAA requires EPA to set national air quality standards
for particulate matter and five other pollutants (the NAAQS) considered harmful to public health
and the environment. Periodically EPA imposes new or modifies existing NAAQS. States that contain
areas that do not meet the new or revised standards must take steps to maintain or achieve
compliance with the standards. These steps could include additional pollution controls on boilers,
engines, turbines, and other facilities owned by electric generation, gas distribution, and gas
transmission operations.

The following NAAQS were recently added or modified:

Particulate Matter:

In 2006, the EPA issued revisions to the NAAQS for particulate matter. The
final rule (1) increased the stringency of the current fine particulate (PM2.5) standard, (2) added
a new standard for inhalable coarse particulate (particulate matter between 10 and 2.5 microns in
diameter), and (3) revoked the annual standards for coarse particulate (PM10) while retaining the
24-hour PM10 standards. These actions were challenged in a case before the DC Court of Appeals,

American Farm Bureau Federation et al. v. EPA.

In 2009, the appeals court granted portions of the
plaintiffs’ petitions challenging the fine particulate standards but denied portions of the
petitions challenging the standards for coarse particulate. State plans implementing the new
standard for inhalable coarse particulate and the modified 24-hour standard for fine particulate
are expected in 2012. The annual and secondary PM2.5 standards have been remanded to the EPA for
reconsideration.

Ozone (eight hour):

On March 12, 2008, the EPA announced the tightening of the eight-hour ozone
NAAQS. EPA has yet to announce the classification structure and the corresponding attainment dates
for the new standard. On September 16, 2009, the EPA announced it would reconsider the March 2008
tightening of the ozone NAAQS and if needed promulgate more stringent standards by August 2010. If
the standards are tightened and area designations subsequently changed, new SIPs will need to be
developed by the states by December 2013 to bring the nonattainment areas in to compliance.
NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in these matters and cannot estimate the
impact of these rules at this time.

National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants.

On February 25, 2009, the EPA proposed
national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for stationary reciprocating internal
combustion engines that are not already covered by earlier EPA regulation. The proposed rule is
scheduled to be finalized in 2010, with compliance generally required three years later. NiSource
will continue to closely monitor developments in this matter and cannot estimate the actual cost of
compliance at this time.

Waste

Several NiSource subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties at waste disposal sites under the
CERCLA (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws. Additionally, a program has been
instituted to identify and investigate former Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) sites where Gas
Distribution Operations subsidiaries or predecessors may have liability. The program has
identified up to 84 such sites and initial investigations have been conducted at 52 sites.
Follow-up investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 50 sites and remedial
measures have been implemented or completed at 30 sites. Remedial actions at many of these sites
are being overseen by state or federal environmental agencies through consent agreements or
voluntary remediation agreements. The final costs of cleanup have not yet been determined. As
site investigations and cleanups proceed reserves are adjusted to reflect new information.

Additional Issues Related to Individual Business Segments

The sections above describe various regulatory actions that affect Electric Operations, Gas
Distribution Operations, and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Specific information is
provided below.


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations.

Waste

Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific
sites under a 1995 EPA AOC. The AOC covered 245 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal
points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations.
Obligations under the AOC have been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal
point sites, storage well locations and all but 50 of the 245 facilities.

One of the facilities subject to the AOC is the Majorsville Operations Center, which was remediated
under an EPA approved Remedial Action Work Plan in summer 2008. Pursuant to the Remedial Action
Work Plan, Columbia Transmission completed a project that stabilized residual oil contained in
soils at the site and in sediments in an adjacent stream. On April 23, 2009, PADEP issued an NOV
to Columbia Transmission, alleging that the remediation was not effective. The NOV asserts
violations of the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law and the Pennsylvania Solid Waste Management Act
and contains proposed penalty of $1 million. Columbia Transmission is unable to estimate the
likelihood or cost of potential penalties or additional remediation at this time.

Electric Operations.

Air

NOx and Ozone Compliance:

Indiana’s rule to implement the EPA’s NOx SIP call requires reduction of
NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to reduce regional
transport of ozone. In response, Northern Indiana developed a NOx compliance plan, which included
the installation of Selective Catalytic Reduction and combustion control NOx reduction technology
at its active generating stations and is currently in compliance with the NOx requirements. In
implementing the NOx compliance plan, Northern Indiana has expended approximately $316.5 million as
of December 31, 2009.

Sulfur dioxide:

On December 8, 2009, EPA proposed to revise the SO2 NAAQS by adopting a new 1-hour
primary NAAQS for sulfur dioxide (SO2). The EPA is expected to finalize the rule during 2010.
States with areas not meeting the standard would have until 2013 to develop attainment plans with
compliance required by summer 2017. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor developments
in these matters and cannot estimate the impact of these rules at this time.

Clean Air Interstate Rule:

EPA enacted the CAIR in 2005. The CAIR establishes phased reductions
of NOx and SO2. As an affected state, Indiana developed CAIR rules which became effective on
February 25, 2007. Northern Indiana developed plans for the first phase of the emission control
construction required to address the Phase I CAIR requirements and obtained regulatory recovery for
these costs. Northern Indiana’s plan includes the upgrade of existing emission controls
and the  installation of new
flue gas desulfurization controls  for an estimated cost of $200 million.

On July 11, 2008, the D.C. Court of Appeals vacated the CAIR in its entirety, and remanded the rule
back to the EPA to develop a rule consistent with the Court’s opinion. In response to petitions
from several parties for rehearing by the full panel, on December 23, 2008, the Court remanded the
CAIR without vacatur to EPA in order to remedy the CAIR’s flaws in accordance with the Court’s July
11, 2008, opinion. Consequently, both the Federal and Indiana CAIR remains in effect while EPA
develops a replacement rule anticipated for proposal in spring 2010. Northern Indiana will
continue to monitor this matter and cannot predict the outcome or impact of EPA action at this
time.

Utility Hazardous Air Pollutants:

On February 8, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit vacated two EPA rules that are the basis for the Indiana Air Pollution
Control Board’s Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) that established utility mercury emission limits in
two phases (2010 and 2018) and a cap-and-trade program to meet those limits. In response to the
vacatur, the EPA is pursuing a new Section 112 rulemaking to establish MACT standards for electric
utilities.

New Source Review:

In 1999, the EPA initiated a New Source Review enforcement action against
several industry sectors, including the electric utility industry. On September 29, 2004, the EPA
issued an NOV to Northern Indiana


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

for alleged violations of the CAA and the Indiana SIP. The NOV alleges that modifications were
made to certain boiler units at three of Northern Indiana’s generating stations between the years
1985 and 1995 without obtaining appropriate air permits. The ultimate resolution could require
additional capital expenditures and operations and maintenance costs, as well as payment of
substantial penalties and development of supplemental environmental projects. Northern Indiana is
currently in discussions with the EPA regarding possible resolutions to this NOV.

Water

The Phase II Rule of the Clean Water Act Section 316(b), which requires all large existing steam
electric generating stations to meet certain performance standards to reduce the effects on aquatic
organisms at their cooling water intake structures, became effective on September 7, 2004. Under
this rule, stations will either have to demonstrate that the performance of their existing fish
protection systems meet the new standards or develop new systems, such as a closed-cycle cooling
tower. Various court challenges and EPA responses ensued. As a result of the litigation, the EPA
will propose a revised 316(b). The Bailly Generating Station is the only Northern Indiana
generating station that does not utilize closed cycle cooling. Northern Indiana will continue to
closely monitor this activity and cannot estimate the costs associated with the ultimate outcome at
this time.

Waste

On March 31, 2005, the EPA and Northern Indiana entered into an AOC under the authority of Section
3008(h) of the RCRA for the Bailly Station. The order requires Northern Indiana to identify the
nature and extent of releases of hazardous waste and hazardous constituents from the facility.
Northern Indiana must also remediate any release of hazardous constituents that present an
unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. The process to complete investigation and
select appropriate remediation activities is ongoing. The final costs of cleanup could change
based on EPA review.

The Federal government continues to show interest in developing regulations covering coal
combustion byproducts. Legislation regulating coal ash pursuant to the Surface Mining Control and
Reclamation Act has been introduced, and the EPA is reviewing its previous determination that
Federal regulation of coal ash as a RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste is not appropriate. The EPA
intends to propose regulation of coal combustion byproducts in early 2010. These proposed
regulations could affect Northern Indiana’s ongoing byproduct reuse programs and could impose
additional requirements on its management of coal ash wastes. Northern Indiana will monitor
developments in this matter and cannot estimate the potential financial impact at this time.

Other Operations.

Waste

NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liabilities, including cleanup liabilities
associated with some of its former operations. Four sites are associated with its former propane
operations and ten sites associated with former petroleum operations. At one of those sites, an
AOC has been signed with EPA to address petroleum residue in soil and groundwater.

Environmental Reserves.

It is management’s continued intent to address environmental issues in
cooperation with regulatory authorities in such a manner as to achieve mutually acceptable
compliance plans. However, there can be no assurance that fines and penalties will not be
incurred. Management expects a significant portion of environmental assessment and remediation
costs to be recoverable through rates for certain NiSource companies.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, NiSource had recorded reserves of approximately $76.4 million and
$73.1 million, respectively, to cover environmental remediation at various sites. NiSource accrues
for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs
is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The original estimates for cleanup can
differ materially from the amount ultimately expended. The actual future expenditures depend on
many factors, including currently enacted laws and regulations, the nature and extent of
contamination, the method of cleanup, and the availability of cost recovery from customers.
NiSource periodically adjusts its reserves as information is collected and estimates become more
refined.

E. Operating and Capital Lease Commitments.

NiSource leases assets in several areas of its
operations. Payments made in connection with operating leases were $56.2 million in 2009, $57.3
million in 2008 and $53.4 million in 2007, and are primarily charged to operation and maintenance
expense as incurred. Capital leases and

related accumulated depreciation included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1.4 million and
$0.4 million at December 31, 2009, and $1.4 million and $0.3 million at December 31, 2008,
respectively.

NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline
business software requiring equal annual payments of $5.8 million over 10 years, which began in
January 2008. This agreement is recorded as a capital lease.

F. Purchase and Service Obligations.

NiSource has entered into various purchase and service
agreements whereby NiSource is contractually obligated to make certain minimum payments in future
periods. NiSource’s purchase obligations are for the purchase of physical quantities of natural
gas, electricity and coal. NiSource’s service agreements encompass a broad range of business
support and maintenance functions which are generally described below.

NiSource’s subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical
quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent minimum quantities of
these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices.

In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indiana’s proposed purchase power
agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC.
These agreements provided Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw
of wind power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw
of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the
variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are
included in the table below. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any
reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern
Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events
giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination.

NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and
storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2010 to 2045, require
NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges.

On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide
business process and support functions to NiSource. IBM has retained responsibility for
information technology operations. NiSource Corporate Services will continue to pay IBM for the
amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges
fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of
these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $505 million to IBM in
service fees over the remaining 5.5 year term. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource
for any reason (other than material breach by IBM), NiSource may be required to pay IBM a
termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBM’s un-recovered capital
investments, and IBM wind-down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending
on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business
process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries
through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate
Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable
charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage
of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $65.1 million to Vertex
Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining 5.5 year term. Upon termination of the
agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC),
NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $13.8 million.

Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation
services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various
periods through 2013.

Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products
and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under
this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a
combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various
performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana
terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty-year contract period.

The estimated aggregate amounts of minimum fixed payments at December 31, 2009, were:

During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash
flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings due to the probability that
certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing
business that NiSource had planned to sell.

Millennium, in which Columbia Transmission has an equity investment, entered into three interest
rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling $420 million with seven counterparties. The
unrecognized after-tax loss

of $5.7 million and $30.3 million as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, was

accumulated other comprehensive loss, representing its ownership portion of the fair value of these
swaps.

24. Segments of Business

Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is
available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to
allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief
operating decision maker.

NiSource’s operations are divided into four primary business segments. The Gas Distribution
Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and
industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and
Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and
storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in
northeastern, mid-Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The
Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of
Indiana. The Other Operations segment primarily includes ventures focused on distributed power
generation technologies, including fuel cells and storage systems.

The following table provides information about business segments. NiSource uses operating income
as its primary measurement for each of the reported segments and makes decisions on finance,
dividends and taxes at the corporate level on a consolidated basis. Segment revenues include
intersegment sales to affiliated subsidiaries, which are eliminated in consolidation. Affiliated sales are recognized on
the basis of prevailing market, regulated prices or at levels provided for under contractual
agreements. Operating income is derived from revenues and expenses directly associated with each
segment. Gas Distribution, Gas Transmission and Storage, Electric, Other Operations, and Corporate
operating income was positively impacted by $6.7 million, $3.3 million, $8.4 million, $0.1 million,
and $0.6 million, respectively, for adjustments to medical expenses during the third quarter 2008
due to a misclassification of certain claims in prior periods. This adjustment had no impact on
actual medical claims paid and was not material to the results of operations and consolidated
financial statements. Electric Operations


ITEM 8.

operating income was negatively impacted by an $8.3 million depreciation expense adjustment
recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. The non-cash adjustment to
depreciation expense was not material to the results of operations and consolidated financial
statements and will not materially impact depreciation charges in future periods.

NiSource’s chief executive officer and its principal financial officer, after evaluating the
effectiveness of NiSource’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)), have concluded based on the evaluation required by paragraph (b) of
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 that, as of the end of the period covered by this report,

only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
NiSource’s management has adopted the framework set forth in the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission report, Internal Control — Integrated Framework, the most
commonly used and understood framework for evaluating internal control over financial reporting, as
its framework for evaluating the reliability and effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. During 2009, NiSource conducted an evaluation of its internal control over financial
reporting. Based on this evaluation, NiSource management concluded that NiSource’s internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual
report.

attestation report on NiSource’s internal controls over financial reporting which is contained in
