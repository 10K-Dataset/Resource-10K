ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

NiSource Inc.

NiSource is an energy holding company whose subsidiaries provide natural gas, electricity and other
products and services to approximately 3.8 million customers located within a corridor that runs
from the Gulf Coast through the Midwest to New England. NiSource is the successor to an Indiana
corporation organized in 1987 under the name of NIPSCO Industries, Inc., which changed its name to
NiSource on April 14, 1999. NiSource is a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 2005.

NiSource is the largest natural gas distribution company operating east of the Rocky Mountains, as
measured by number of customers. NiSource’s principal subsidiaries include Columbia, a
vertically-integrated natural gas distribution, transmission and storage holding company whose
subsidiaries provide service to customers in the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast;
Northern Indiana, a vertically-integrated gas and electric company providing service to customers
in northern Indiana; and Bay State, a natural gas distribution company serving customers in
Massachusetts. NiSource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating
results of its fifteen direct subsidiaries.

NiSource’s business segments are: Gas Distribution Operations; Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations; Electric Operations; and Other Operations. Following is a summary of the business for
each reporting segment. Refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations”, for additional information for each segment.

Gas Distribution Operations

NiSource’s natural gas distribution operations serve more than 3.3 million customers in seven
states and operate approximately 57 thousand miles of pipeline. Through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Columbia, NiSource owns five distribution subsidiaries that provide natural gas to
approximately 2.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Virginia, Kentucky and Maryland. NiSource also distributes natural gas to approximately 793
thousand customers in northern Indiana through three subsidiaries: Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas
and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Additionally, NiSource’s subsidiary Bay State distributes
natural gas to approximately 291 thousand customers in Massachusetts.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations

NiSource’s Gas Transmission and Storage Operations subsidiaries own and operate approximately 16
thousand miles of interstate pipelines and operate one of the nation’s largest underground natural
gas storage systems capable of storing approximately 629 Bcf of natural gas. Through its
subsidiaries, Columbia Transmission, Columbia Gulf and Crossroads Pipeline, NiSource owns and
operates an interstate pipeline network extending from offshore in the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Erie,
New York and the eastern seaboard. Together, these companies serve customers in 16 northeastern,
mid-Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations subsidiaries have recently completed milestone projects
with Millennium and Hardy Storage and are engaged in other projects that will expand their
facilities and throughput. In June 2007, construction began on the Millennium pipeline, which
includes 182-miles of newly constructed, 30-inch-diameter pipe across New York’s Southern Tier and
lower Hudson Valley. Substantially all of the facilities related to the project were completed in
the fourth quarter of 2008 and the pipeline commenced service on December 22, 2008. Millennium
will transport up to 525,400 Dth per day of natural gas to markets along its route, as well as to
the New York City markets through its pipeline interconnections. Millennium is jointly owned by
affiliates of NiSource, DTE Energy and National Grid. Hardy Storage commenced operations in April
of 2007, receiving customer injections and withdrawing natural gas from its new underground natural
gas storage facility in West Virginia. Injections in 2008 allowed the field to deliver up to
150,000 Dth of natural gas per day during the 2008-2009 winter heating season. Customers withdrew
over 5.44 Bcf from the storage field during the 2007-2008 winter heating season. When fully
operational in 2009, the field will have a working storage capacity of 12 Bcf, delivering 176,000
Dth of natural gas per day. Hardy Storage is a joint venture of subsidiaries of Columbia
Transmission and Piedmont. Projects in the construction stage include the Eastern Market Expansion
which is projected to add 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability, and the
Appalachian Expansion which is projected to add 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity.



ITEM 1.

BUSINESS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Electric Operations

NiSource generates, transmits and distributes electricity through its subsidiary Northern Indiana
to approximately 457 thousand customers in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana and engages
in wholesale and transmission transactions. Northern Indiana owns four and has the current ability
to operate three coal-fired electric generating stations. The three operable facilities have a net
capability of 2,574 mw. Northern Indiana also operates Sugar Creek, a CCGT plant with a 535 mw
capacity rating, four gas-fired generating units located at Northern Indiana’s coal-fired electric
generating stations with a net capability of 203 mw and two hydroelectric generating plants with a
net capability of 10 mw. These facilities provide for a total system operating net capability of
3,322 mw. Sugar Creek was purchased in May, 2008 and dispatched into MISO on December 1, 2008.
Northern Indiana’s transmission system, with voltages from 69,000 to 345,000 volts, consists of
2,782 circuit miles. Northern Indiana is interconnected with five neighboring electric utilities.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, Northern Indiana generated 81.6% and purchased 18.4% of
its electric requirements. Northern Indiana’s Mitchell Station, indefinitely shut down in 2002, is
not included in the net capacity of the three coal-fired generation stations. In the electric base
rate case Northern Indiana filed in August 2008, Northern Indiana provided testimony that it
intends to retire the Mitchell station, demolish it, and remediate the site to industrial
condition, subject to the ability to recover these costs.

Northern Indiana participates in the MISO transmission service and wholesale energy market. The
MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with the FERC, to improve the flow of
electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Additionally, MISO is
responsible for managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, managing the
day-ahead, real-time and FTRs markets and managing the ancillary market. Northern Indiana
transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO and transmission service
for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff.

Other Operations

The Other Operations segment participates in energy-related services including gas marketing, power
and gas risk management and ventures focused on distributed power generation technologies and fuel
cells and storage systems. Additionally, the Other Operations segment is involved in real estate
and other businesses.

Divestiture of Non-Core Assets

In recent years, NiSource sold certain businesses judged to be non-core to NiSource’s strategy.
NiSource sold Whiting Clean Energy to BPAE in April 2008 for $216.7 million which included $16.1
million in working capital. In December 2008, NiSource sold Northern Utilities and Granite State
Gas for $201.6 million which included $41.6 million in working capital which may be adjusted based
upon the final settlement during the first quarter of 2009. Columbia Gulf sold a portion of
Columbia Gulf’s offshore assets to Tennessee Gas Pipeline in June 2008. Lake Erie Land, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of NiSource, has sold and is in the process of selling certain real estate,
which included its Sand Creek Golf Club assets, which were sold in June 2006, to a private real
estate developer. NDC Douglas Properties, a subsidiary of NiSource Development Company, is in the
process of exiting its low income housing investments. NiSource Retail Services, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of NiSource, is currently engaged in a process to sell certain assets.

Business Strategy

NiSource focuses its business strategy on its core, rate-regulated asset-based businesses with
virtually 100% of its operating income generated from the rate-regulated businesses. With the
nation’s fourth largest natural gas pipeline, the largest natural gas distribution network east of
the Rocky Mountains and one of the nation’s largest natural gas storage networks, NiSource operates
throughout the energy-intensive corridor that extends from the supply areas in the Gulf Coast
through the consumption centers in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, New England and Northeast. This
corridor includes over 40% of the nation’s population and close to 50% of its natural gas
consumption. NiSource continues to position its assets to meet the corridor’s growing energy
needs.

Competition and Changes in the Regulatory Environment

The regulatory frameworks applicable to NiSource’s operations, at both the state and federal
levels, continue to evolve. These changes have had and will continue to have an impact on
NiSource’s operations, structure and



ITEM 1.

BUSINESS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

profitability. Management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in
this changing environment, including providing gas customers with increased choices for products
and services.

Natural Gas Competition.

Open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the
deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets. LDC
customers and marketers purchase gas directly from producers and marketers and an open, competitive
market for gas supplies has emerged. This separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and
other services offered by pipelines and LDCs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent
of services provided by the pipelines and LDCs. The LDCs continue to purchase gas and recover the
associated costs from their customers. NiSource’s Gas Distribution Operations’ subsidiaries are
involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas
requirements from third parties and use the NiSource Gas Distribution Operations’ subsidiaries for
transportation services.

Electric Competition.

Northern Indiana currently sells all power from its plants into the MISO.
Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff.

NiSource’s Other Operations subsidiaries also experience competition for energy sales and related
services from third party providers. NiSource meets these challenges through innovative programs
aimed at providing energy products and services at competitive prices while also providing new
services that are responsive to the evolving energy market and customer requirements.

Financing Subsidiary

NiSource Finance is a wholly-owned, consolidated finance subsidiary of NiSource that engages in
financing activities to raise funds for the business operations of NiSource and its subsidiaries.
NiSource Finance was incorporated in February 2000 under the laws of the state of Indiana.
NiSource Finance’s obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NiSource.

Other Relevant Business Information

NiSource’s customer base is broadly diversified, with no single customer accounting for a
significant portion of revenues.

As of December 31, 2008, NiSource had 7,981 employees of whom 3,388 were subject to collective
bargaining agreements.

For a listing of certain subsidiaries of NiSource refer to Exhibit 21.

NiSource files various reports with the SEC. The reports include the annual report on Form 10-K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed
or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. NiSource
makes all SEC filings available without charge to the public on its web site at

http://www.nisource.com.



ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

NiSource Inc.

There are many factors that could have a material adverse effect on NiSource’s operating results,
financial condition and cash flows. New risks may emerge at any time, and NiSource cannot predict
those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance. Each of the
risks described below could adversely impact the value of NiSource’s securities.

NiSource has substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect its financial condition.

NiSource has a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding in part as a result of the
acquisition of Columbia and Bay State. NiSource had total consolidated indebtedness of $7,576.7
million outstanding as of December 31, 2008. The substantial indebtedness could have important
consequences to investors. For example, it could:

Some of NiSource’s debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debt-to-capital ratios
and cross-default provisions. NiSource’s failure to comply with any of these covenants could
result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of
outstanding debt obligations. Additionally, a drop in NiSource’s credit rating could adversely
impact the cost for NiSource to issue new debt securities.

On December 16, 2008, Standard and Poor’s affirmed its senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and
its subsidiaries at BBB-; however, it changed the ratings outlook for NiSource and all of its
subsidiaries to negative from stable. On February 4, 2009, Moody’s Investors Services affirmed the
senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries.
Moody’s outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is negative. On February 4, 2009, Fitch lowered
its senior unsecured ratings for NiSource to BBB- and for Northern Indiana to BBB. Fitch’s outlook
for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment
grade, an additional downgrade by Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s or Fitch would result in a rating
that is below investment grade.

Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased
collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB- by
Standard and Poor’s or Baa3 by Moody’s. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the
ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $30 million. In addition to agreements with
ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse
change” provisions that could result in additional credit support such as letters of credit and
cash collateral to transact business. In addition, under Northern Indiana’s trade receivables
sales program, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indiana’s debt rating
falls below BBB- or Baa3 by Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s, respectively.

Adverse economic and market conditions and increases in interest rates may reduce net revenue
growth, increase costs, decrease future net income and cash flows and impact capital resources and
liquidity needs.

The credit markets and the general economy have been experiencing a period of large-scale turmoil
and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale of various financial
institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States federal government.
While the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted, it may have an adverse material
effect on NiSource.



ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

A decline in the economy impacting NiSource’s operating jurisdictions could adversely affect
NiSource’s ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers, which could
reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs. An increase in the interest rates NiSource
pays would adversely affect future net income and cash flows. In addition, NiSource depends on
debt to finance its operations, including both working capital and capital expenditures, and would
be adversely affected by increases in interest rates. The current economic downturn and tightening
of access to credit markets, coupled with NiSource’s current credit ratings, could impact
NiSource’s ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt at a reasonable cost. Refer to
Note 16, “Long-Term Debt,” of the Consolidated Financial statements for information related to
outstanding long-term debt and maturities of that debt.

Capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which
then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings.

The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to
satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
NiSource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts.
These assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns, which fall below
NiSource’s projected rates of return. A decline in the market value of assets may increase the
funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement
benefit plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit
plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, which could potentially increase
funding requirements. Further, the funding requirements of the obligations related to these
benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant
demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions.
Ultimately, significant funding requirements and increased pension expense could negatively impact
NiSource’s results of operations and financial position.

NiSource’s costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant. The costs of compliance
with future environmental laws and the incurrence of environmental liabilities could impact cash
flow and profitability.

NiSource’s subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental
requirements that, among other things, regulate air emissions, water usage and discharges,
remediation and the management of chemicals, hazardous waste and solid waste. Compliance with
these legal obligations requires NiSource to commit significant expenditures for installation of
pollution control equipment, remediation, environmental monitoring, emissions fees and permits at
many of NiSource’s facilities. These expenditures are significant, and NiSource expects that they
will continue to be significant in the future.

NiSource subsidiaries emit greenhouse gases as a result of operations. Future legislative and
regulatory programs could significantly restrict emissions of these greenhouse gases. Compliance
costs associated with these requirements could potentially be significant and affect cash flow and
profitability.

If NiSource’s subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to
the environment or persons, even if caused by factors beyond NiSource’s control, that failure or
harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against NiSource and
its subsidiaries. In September 2004, the EPA issued an NOV to Northern Indiana alleging violations
of the new source review provisions of the CAA. An adverse outcome in this matter could require
capital expenditures beyond the EPA requirements that cannot be determined at this time and could
require payment of substantial penalties.

Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised, and new laws and regulations seeking to
protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to NiSource’s subsidiaries. Revised or
additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating
restrictions on NiSource’s facilities or increased compliance costs, which may not be fully
recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income. The cost impact of any new or
amended legislation would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at
this time.

A significant portion of the gas and electricity NiSource sells is used by residential and
commercial customers for heating and air conditioning. Accordingly, the operating results
fluctuate depending on the weather and, to a certain extent, usage of gas or electricity.



ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather. Forecasts of energy sales are based on normal
weather, which represents a long-term historical average. Significant variations from normal
weather could have, and have had, a material impact on energy sales. Additionally, residential
usage, and to some degree commercial usage, have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity
costs for gas and electricity, whereby usage declines with increased costs, thus affecting
NiSource’s financial results. Lastly, residential and commercial customers’ usage has shown to be
sensitive to economic conditions and the impact of macro-economic drivers such as unemployment,
consumption and consumer confidence, which could also affect NiSource’s financial results.

NiSource’s electric operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries.

Electric operations in northern Indiana have been and may continue to be adversely affected by
events in the steel and steel related industries. In particular, sales to large industrial
customers within these steel and steel related industries may be impacted by economic downturns.
The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international
competition, increased costs, and fluctuating demand for their products.

The majority of NiSource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the
impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings.

Virtually all of NiSource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal
or state level. As such, the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to
regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority. These rate reviews determine the
energy rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues. As part of a settlement reached in
a previous regulatory proceeding, Northern Indiana filed a petition for new electric base rates and
charges on June 27, 2008 and filed its case-in-chief on August 29, 2008. Assuming the case goes
through the full procedural schedule without settlement, the final hearing is scheduled to begin
July 27, 2009 and new rates are anticipated to take effect in early 2010. The outcome for any rate
case could have a material effect on NiSource’s financial results.

NiSource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services,
and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating
agreements.

NiSource’s extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy, involves considerable
judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition, credit
history and other factors. Credit risk exposure is monitored by obtaining credit reports and
updated financial information for customers and suppliers, and by evaluating the financial status
of its banking partners and other counterparties through the use of market-based metrics such as
credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the
major credit rating agencies.

NiSource has significant goodwill and amortizable intangible assets. An impairment of goodwill or
amortizable intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earnings.

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, NiSource tests goodwill for impairment
at least annually and reviews its amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill would also
be tested for impairment when factors might indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable
such as reduced cash flow estimates. Another factor could be a sustained decline in the stock
price and market capitalization below the book value. NiSource would be required to record a
charge in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or
amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively impacting the results of operations. A
significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under the five-year revolving
credit facility and the two-year term loan facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a
debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar
covenant in the 2005 private
placement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

NiSource Inc.

Discussed below are the principal properties held by NiSource and its subsidiaries as of December
31, 2008.

Gas Distribution Operations.

NiSource’s Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries own and operate a
total of 57,466 miles of pipelines and certain related facilities. This includes: (i) for the
five distribution subsidiaries of its Columbia system, 35,324 miles of pipelines, 1,350 reservoir
acres of underground storage, eight storage wells, liquid propane facilities with a capacity of 1.8
million gallons, an LNG facility with a total capacity of 0.5 million gallons and one compressor
station with 800 hp of installed capacity, (ii) for its Northern Indiana system, 15,378 miles of
pipelines, 27,129 reservoir acres of underground storage, 82 storage wells, two compressor stations
with a total of 6,000 hp of installed capacity and an LNG facility with a storage capacity of 48.6
million gallons, (iii) for its Bay State system, 4,863 miles of pipelines, LNG facilities with a
total capacity of 21.9 million gallons and liquid propane facilities with a capacity of 1.6 million
gallons (iv) for its Northern Indiana Fuel and Light system, 865 miles of pipelines, and (v) for
its Kokomo Gas system, 1,036 miles of pipelines and an LNG facility with a capacity of 4.9 million
gallons. The physical properties of the NiSource gas utilities are located throughout Ohio,
Indiana, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, and Massachusetts.

Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations.

Columbia Transmission has
approximately 826 thousand
leased acres of underground storage, 3,528 storage wells, 11,684 miles of interstate pipelines and
89 compressor stations with 599,104 hp of installed capacity. These operations are located in
Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia
and West Virginia. Columbia Gulf has 3,772 miles of transmission pipelines and 11 compressor
stations with 466,522 hp of installed capacity. Columbia Gulf’s operations are located in
Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas, Wyoming, and the offshore Gulf of Mexico.
Crossroads Pipeline has 202 miles of transmission pipeline and one compressor station with 3,000 hp
of installed capacity. Crossroads Pipeline’s operations are located in Indiana and Ohio.

Electric Operations.

NiSource generates, transmits and distributes electricity through its
subsidiary Northern Indiana to approximately 457 thousand customers in 20 counties in the northern
part of Indiana and engages in wholesale and transmission transactions. Northern Indiana owns four
and has the current ability to operate three coal-fired electric generating stations. The three
operable facilities have a net capability of 2,574 mw. Northern Indiana also operates Sugar Creek,
a CCGT plant with a 535 mw capacity rating, four gas-fired generating units located at Northern
Indiana’s coal-fired electric generating stations with a net capability of 203 mw and two
hydroelectric generating plants with a net capability of 10 mw. These facilities provide for a
total system operating net capability of 3,322 mw. Sugar Creek was purchased in May, 2008 and
dispatched into MISO on December 1, 2008. Northern Indiana’s transmission system, with voltages
from 69,000 to 345,000 volts, consists of 2,782 circuit miles. Northern Indiana is interconnected
with five neighboring electric utilities.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, Northern Indiana generated 81.6% and purchased 18.4% of
its electric requirements. Northern Indiana’s Mitchell Station, indefinitely shut down in 2002, is
not included in the net capacity of the three coal-fired generation stations. In the electric base
rate case Northern Indiana filed in August 2008, Northern Indiana provided testimony that it
intends to retire the Mitchell station, demolish it, and remediate the site to industrial
condition, subject to the ability to recover these costs.

Other Operations.

NiSource owns the Southlake Complex, its 325,000 square foot headquarters
building located in Merrillville, Indiana and other residential and development property.



ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Character of Ownership.

The principal offices and properties of NiSource and its subsidiaries are
held in fee and are free from encumbrances, subject to minor exceptions, none of which are of such
a nature as to impair substantially the usefulness of such properties. Many of the offices in
various communities served are occupied by subsidiaries of NiSource under leases. All properties
are subject to liens for taxes, assessments and undetermined charges (if any) incidental to
construction. It is NiSource’s practice regularly to pay such amounts, as and when due, unless
contested in good faith. In general, the electric lines, gas pipelines and related facilities are
located on land not owned in fee but are covered by necessary consents of various governmental
authorities or by appropriate rights obtained from owners of private property. NiSource does not,
however, generally have specific easements from the owners of the property adjacent to public
highways over, upon or under which its electric lines and gas distribution pipelines are located.
At the time each of the principal properties was purchased a title search was made. In general, no
examination of titles as to rights-of-way for electric lines, gas pipelines or related facilities
was made, other than examination, in certain cases, to verify the grantors’ ownership and the lien
status thereof.



ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

NiSource Inc.

1.

Stand Energy Corporation, et al. v. Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation, et al., Kanawha
County Court, West Virginia

On July 14, 2004, Stand Energy Corporation filed a complaint in Kanawha County Court in West
Virginia. The complaint contains allegations against various NiSource companies, including
Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, and asserts that those companies and certain “select
shippers” engaged in an “illegal gas scheme” that constituted a breach of contract and violated
state law. The “illegal gas scheme” complained of by the plaintiffs relates to the Columbia
Transmission and Columbia Gulf gas imbalance transactions that were the subject of the FERC
enforcement staff investigation and subsequent settlement approved in October 2000. Columbia
Transmission and Columbia Gulf filed a Motion to Dismiss on September 10, 2004. In October 2004,
however, the plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint, which clarified the identity of some
of the “select shipper” defendants and added a federal antitrust cause of action. To address the
issues raised in the Second Amended Complaint, the Columbia companies revised their briefs in
support of the previously filed motions to dismiss. In June 2005, the Court granted in part and
denied in part the Columbia companies’ motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. The
Columbia companies have filed an answer to the Second Amended Complaint. On December 1, 2005,
Plaintiffs filed a motion to certify this case as a class action. The Columbia companies filed
their opposition to this motion in March 2008. On August 19, 2008, the Court denied the Motion for
Class Certification. In late December 2008, the lead plaintiff, Stand Energy Corporation, reached
a settlement agreement of all claims with all Defendants. Stand Energy Corporation was dismissed
from the case on December 31, 2008. The Columbia companies continue to defend against the claims
made by the remaining individual plaintiffs. The previously scheduled trial date of April 28, 2009
has been cancelled.

2.

United States of America ex rel. Jack J. Grynberg v. Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation,
et al., U.S. District Court, E.D. Louisiana

The plaintiff filed a complaint in 1995, under the False Claims Act, on behalf of the United States
of America, against approximately seventy pipelines, including Columbia Gulf and Columbia
Transmission. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants had submitted false royalty reports to the
government by mismeasuring natural gas produced on Federal land and Indian lands. The Plaintiff’s
original complaint was dismissed without prejudice for misjoinder of parties and for failing to
plead fraud with specificity. In 1997, the plaintiff filed over sixty-five new False Claims Act
complaints against over 330 defendants in numerous Federal courts. One of those complaints was
filed in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against Columbia and
thirteen affiliated entities (collectively, the “Columbia defendants”). This complaint repeats the
mismeasurement claims previously made and adds valuation claims alleging that the defendants
undervalued natural gas for royalty purposes in various ways, including sales to affiliated
entities at artificially low prices. This case was transferred, along with most of the other new
Grynberg cases, to Federal court in Wyoming in 1999.

On October 20, 2006, the Federal District Court issued an Order granting the Columbia defendants’
motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Plaintiff has appealed the
dismissal of the Columbia defendants to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.
All briefing has been completed and oral argument was held on September 25, 2008.

3.

Tawney, et al. v. Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., Roane County, WV Circuit Court

The Plaintiffs, who are West Virginia landowners, filed a lawsuit in early 2003 against CNR
alleging that CNR underpaid royalties on gas produced on their land by improperly deducting
post-production costs and not paying a fair value for the gas. In December 2004, the court granted
plaintiffs’ motion to add NiSource and Columbia as defendants. Plaintiffs also claimed that the
defendants fraudulently concealed the deduction of post-production charges. The court certified
the case as a class action that includes any person who, after July 31, 1990, received or is due
royalties from CNR (and its predecessors or successors) on lands lying within the boundary of the
state of West Virginia. All claims by the government of the United States are excluded from the
class. Although NiSource sold CNR in 2003, NiSource remains obligated to manage this litigation
and for the majority of any damages ultimately awarded to the plaintiffs. On January 27, 2007, the
jury hearing the case returned a verdict against all defendants in the amount of $404.3 million;
this is comprised of $134.3 million in compensatory damages and $270 million in punitive damages.
In January 2008, the Defendants filed their petition for appeal, and on March 24, 2008,



ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

the Defendants filed their amended petition for appeal with the West Virginia Supreme Court of
Appeals. On May 22, 2008, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals refused the Defendants
petition for appeal. On August 22, 2008, Defendants filed their petitions to the United States
Supreme Court for writ of certiorari. The Plaintiffs filed their response on September 22, 2008.
On September 19, 2008, the West Virginia Supreme Court issued an order extending the stay of the
judgment until proceedings before the United States Supreme Court are fully concluded. Given the
West Virginia Court’s refusal of the appeal, NiSource adjusted its reserve in the second quarter of
2008 to reflect the portion of the trial court judgment for which NiSource would be responsible,
inclusive of interest. This amount was included in “Legal and environmental reserves,” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008. On October 24, 2008, the West Virginia Circuit
Court for Roane County, West Virginia, preliminarily approved a settlement agreement with a total
settlement amount of $380 million. The settlement received final approval by the Court on November
22, 2008. NiSource’s share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource has
complied with its obligations under the settlement agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified
settlement fund by January 13, 2009. NiSource has also complied with its obligation to provide a
letter of credit on January 15, 2009, securing the unpaid portion of the settlement. The trial
court entered its order discharging the judgment on January 20, 2009.

John Thacker, et al. v. Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C., U.S. District Court, E.D. Kentucky
Poplar Creek Development Company v. Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C., U.S. District Court, E.D.
Kentucky

On February 8, 2007, Plaintiff filed the Thacker case, a purported class action alleging that
Chesapeake has failed to pay royalty owners the correct amounts pursuant to the provisions of their
oil and gas leases covering real property located within the state of Kentucky. Columbia has
assumed the defense of Chesapeake in this matter pursuant to the provisions of the Stock Purchase
Agreement dated July 3, 2003, among Columbia, NiSource, and Triana Energy Holding, Inc.,
Chesapeake’s predecessor in interest (“Stock Purchase Agreement”). Plaintiffs filed an amended
complaint on March 19, 2007, which, among other things, added NiSource and Columbia as defendants.
On March 31, 2008, the Court denied the Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss; the Defendants filed their
answers to the complaint on April 25, 2008. On June 3, 2008, the Plaintiffs moved to certify a
class consisting of all persons entitled to payment of royalty by Chesapeake under leases operated
by Chesapeake at any point after February 5, 1992, on real property in Kentucky. Defendants’
response was filed on July 18, 2008.

On October 9, 2008, Chesapeake tendered the Poplar Creek case to Columbia and Columbia subsequently
assumed the defense of this matter pursuant to the provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreement.
Poplar Creek also purports to be a class action covering royalty owners in the state of Kentucky
and alleges that Chesapeake has improperly deducted costs from the royalty payments; there is thus
some overlap of parties and issues between the Poplar Creek and Thacker cases. Plaintiffs filed an
amended complaint on October 12, 2008. Chesapeake filed its answer on December 8, 2008.

5.

Environmental Protection Agency Notice of Violation

On September 29, 2004, the EPA issued an NOV to Northern Indiana for alleged violations of the CAA
and the Indiana SIP. The NOV alleges that modifications were made to certain boiler units at three
of Northern Indiana’s generating stations between the years of 1985 and 1995 without obtaining
appropriate air permits for the modifications. The ultimate resolution could require additional
capital expenditures and operations and maintenance costs as well as payment of substantial
penalties and require development of supplemental environmental projects. Northern Indiana is
currently in discussions with the EPA regarding possible resolutions to this NOV.

6.

Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Proposed Consent Order and Agreement

On February 21, 2007, PADEP provided representatives of Columbia Transmission with a proposed
Consent Order and Agreement covering an unmanned equipment storage site located in rural southwest
Pennsylvania. The site in question is also subject to the EPA’s AOC (Refer to Note 19-D,
“Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding the AOC). PADEP’s proposed order alleges that Columbia Transmission has
violated the state’s Clean Streams Act and Solid Waste Management Act by discharging petroleum
products onto the property and into the waters of the state. In addition to requiring remediation
and monitoring activities at the site, the state has proposed penalties for these violations. The
site was

remediated via an EPA approved Remedial Action Work Plan in the summer of 2008. The PADEP had
provided written notification that it would not attempt to stop the EPA approved work and would
seek the aforementioned Order after the remedy is completed. On January 6, 2009, PADEP provided
Columbia Transmission with a Consent Assessment of Civil Penalty seeking a civil penalty of $700
thousand for alleged violations of the Clean Streams Law. Columbia Transmission is seeking
clarification from the agency regarding the proposed penalty.

As of December 31, 2008, NiSource had 36,194 common stockholders of record and 274,261,799 shares
outstanding.

Holders of shares of NiSource’s common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, and if
declared by NiSource’s Board out of funds legally available. The policy of the Board has been to
declare cash dividends on a quarterly basis payable on or about the 20th day of February, May,
August and November. NiSource paid quarterly common dividends totaling $0.92 per share for the
years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. By unanimous written consent dated January 9, 2009,
the Board declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.23 per share, payable on February 20, 2009 to
holders of record on January 30, 2009.

Although the Board currently intends to continue the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on
common shares, the timing and amount of future dividends will depend on the earnings of NiSource’s
subsidiaries, their financial condition, cash requirements, regulatory restrictions, any
restrictions in financing agreements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.

Note regarding forward-looking statements

The Management’s Discussion and Analysis, including statements regarding market risk sensitive
instruments, contains “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Investors and prospective investors should understand that many factors govern whether
any forward-looking statement contained herein will be or can be realized. Any one of those
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning NiSource’s plans,
objectives, expected performance, expenditures and recovery of expenditures through rates, stated
on either a consolidated or segment basis, and any and all underlying assumptions and other
statements that are other than statements of historical fact. From time to time, NiSource may
publish or otherwise make available forward-looking statements of this nature. All such subsequent
forward-looking statements, whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of NiSource,
are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. All forward-looking statements are
based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance
that actual results will not differ materially.

Realization of NiSource’s objectives and expected performance is subject to a wide range of risks
and can be adversely affected by, among other things, weather, fluctuations in supply and demand
for energy commodities, growth opportunities for NiSource’s businesses, increased competition in
deregulated energy markets, the success of regulatory and commercial initiatives, dealings with
third parties over whom NiSource has no control, the success of NiSource’s restructured outsourcing
agreement, actual operating experience of NiSource’s assets, the regulatory process, regulatory and
legislative changes, changes in general economic, capital and commodity market conditions, and
counter-party credit risk, many of which risks are beyond the control of NiSource. In addition,
the relative contributions to profitability by each segment, and the assumptions underlying the
forward-looking statements relating thereto, may change over time.

CONSOLIDATED REVIEW

Executive Summary

NiSource is an energy holding company whose subsidiaries are engaged in the transmission, storage
and distribution of natural gas in the high-demand energy corridor stretching from the Gulf Coast
through the Midwest to New England and the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity
in Indiana. NiSource generates virtually 100% of its operating income through these rate-regulated
businesses. A significant portion of NiSource’s operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations in
sales. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, net revenues
from gas sales are more significant, and during the cooling season, which is primarily from June
through September, net revenues from the Electric Operations segment are more significant than in
other months.

NiSource is a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, NiSource reported income from continuing operations
of $369.8 million, or $1.35 per basic share, compared to $302.9 million, or $1.10 per basic share
in 2007.

Increases in income from continuing operations were due primarily to the following items:

•

Net revenues for Distribution Operations increased from 2007. This increase was due
primarily to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate proceedings at
Columbia of Pennsylvania, Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Kentucky and Bay State, the impact of
an adjustment for estimated unbilled revenues of $14.6 million recorded by Northern Indiana in
2007, increased trackers which are offset in expense and colder weather.

•

On December 31, 2007, Whiting Clean Energy redeemed $292.1 million of its notes due June
20, 2011, having an average interest rate of 8.30%. The associated redemption premium of $40.6
million was charged to loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt in 2007 results.

•

Interest expense decreased due to lower short-term interest rates and the retirement late
in 2007 of high cost debt associated with the Whiting Clean Energy facility.

•

Other, net was income of $17.6 million for 2008 versus expense of $6.4 million in 2007.
The 2008 results include NiSource Development Company’s sale of its interest in JOF
Transportation Company to Lehigh Service Corporation on August 27, 2008, for a pre-tax gain of
$16.7 million. JOF Transportation Company held 40% interest in Chicago South Shore & South
Bend Railroad Co. and a 40% interest in Indiana Illinois Development Company, LLC. The
additional change from last year is due from lower costs related to the sale of accounts
receivable.

•

The effective income tax rate was 33.4% in 2008 a decrease from the 35.2% effective rate
reported in 2007. The decrease was primarily due to recent legislation in Massachusetts that
reduced income tax expense by $14.9 million in 2008. Refer to Note 11, “Income Taxes,” in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.

Decreases in income from continuing operations were due primarily to the following items:

•

Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher operation and maintenance expenses
across NiSource’s business segments. Increased depreciation charges and other taxes also
contributed to the higher operating expenses. See the following bullet points for
explanations for these increases.

•

Operation and maintenance expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and
administrative expenses that include payroll, benefits and corporate services. The increase
was a result of higher payroll costs for increased headcount, costs of living and performance
adjustments, and corporate service costs related to information technology and consulting.

•

Operation and maintenance expenses also increased due to higher electric generation and
maintenance costs and higher trackers which are collected in revenues partially offset by
lower legal reserves and an adjustment to medical expenses. The increase in electric
generation and maintenance costs resulted from planned turbine and boiler maintenance and a
generator overhaul, as well as incremental costs associated with the Sugar Creek facility.

•

The higher depreciation cost includes an $8.3 million depreciation expense adjustment
recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008 and depreciation on the new
Sugar Creek facility. The increase in other taxes is primarily due to higher gross receipts
taxes that are mostly subject to trackers and are therefore collected in net revenues.

These factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the
following discussions of “Results of Operations” and “Results and Discussion of Segment
Operations.”

Strengthening NiSource’s Financial Position and Balance Sheet

As part of its efforts to strengthen its balance sheet and focus on its core regulated assets,
NiSource took a number of steps in 2008 to divest certain non-strategic assets and to address
certain legacy issues. These included:

•

The completion of the sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas Transmission to
Unitil Corp. in December 2008 for $201.6 million, including working capital. The working
capital amount will be adjusted based upon the final settlement during the first quarter of
2009.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

•

The sale of the Whiting Clean Energy facility to BPAE in June 2008 for $216.7 million,
including working capital.

•

The disposition of certain non-strategic Columbia Gulf assets in the Gulf of Mexico
area.

•

The resolution of the Tawney class action litigation, which involved natural gas royalty
claims asserted against CNR, a former NiSource subsidiary for which NiSource retained
primary financial responsibility. On November 22, 2008, a West Virginia court approved a
settlement of the case, with NiSource to pay an amount not to exceed $338.8 million.

The following steps were also taken during 2008 to secure financing and strengthen NiSource’s
liquidity position:

•

During the second quarter, NiSource issued $700 million
of senior unsecured debt.

•

In September 2008, NiSource supplemented its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that
extends to July 2011 with a new, six-month $500 million credit facility. That facility
helped ensure ample liquidity to accommodate the company’s seasonal cash flow requirements
and to provide near-term funding flexibility related to the Tawney settlement. On February
13, 2009, the six-month credit facility was terminated in conjunction with the closing of a
new two-year bank loan facility.

•

NiSource also refinanced $254 million in Northern Indiana Pollution Control Bonds in
August 2008 at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 5.58%, and renewed Northern
Indiana’s $200 million accounts receivable facility in December 2008.

Reaction to Global Financial Environment

Since the financial crisis began, NiSource and its Board have been closely monitoring developments,
assessing potential impacts on its businesses and developing plans to effectively manage through
this period. A key area of focus relates to continued access to credit markets on reasonable
terms. NiSource is also concentrating on the impacts of the economic decline on the industrial
customer segment and other markets it serves, and increases in pension expense and funding
requirements.

Through a combination of capital spending, working capital and operation and maintenance
reductions, NiSource expects to reduce its total projected 2009 financing requirements from nearly
$1 billion to approximately $500 million. The company’s resulting $500 million financing
requirement of 2009 together with improvements to working capital are expected to be sufficient to
fund the refinancing of outstanding debt scheduled to mature in November 2009 and all payments
associated with the Tawney settlement. See further discussion within the “Liquidity and Capital
Resources” of Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

NiSource will continue to closely monitor events in the credit markets, as well as overall economic
conditions in the nation and markets it serves. Maintaining financial flexibility will remain a
key priority for NiSource.

Four-Point Platform for Growth

NiSource’s four-part business plan will continue to center on commercial and regulatory
initiatives; commercial growth and expansion of the gas transmission and storage business;
financial management of the balance sheet; and process and expense management.

Commercial and Regulatory Initiatives

Rate Development and Other Regulatory Matters.

NiSource is moving forward on regulatory
initiatives across several distribution company markets. Whether through full rate case filings or
other approaches, NiSource’s goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as it
addresses changing customer conservation patterns, develops more contemporary pricing structures,
and embarks on long-term investment programs to enhance its infrastructure.

Northern Indiana filed a petition for new electric base rates and charges on June 27, 2008 and
filed its case-in-chief on August 29, 2008. The filing requested a two-step increase. The first
step request was for an increase of approximately $24 million. The second step was for an
additional increase of approximately $81 million to incorporate the return on and recovery of the
Sugar Creek facility. Such increase was expected to become effective
at the date of dispatch of Sugar Creek by MISO. On December 1, 2008, Northern Indiana successfully
dispatched Sugar Creek into MISO, simultaneous with the termination of its PJM commitment. As a
result, a revised case-in-

NiSource Inc.

chief was filed on December 19, 2008, incorporating Sugar Creek and
resulting in a traditional one-step case, requesting an increase in base rates calculated to
produce additional gross margin of $85.7 million annually. Several stakeholder groups have
intervened in the case, representing customer groups and various counties and towns within Northern
Indiana’s electric service territory. A field hearing allowing customers to individually
participate will occur on March 3, 2009. The OUCC and intervenors are scheduled to file their
cases-in-chief by April 17, 2009. Northern Indiana is scheduled to file its rebuttal testimony in
June 2009, and final hearings are planned to begin July 27, 2009. If a settlement agreement is not
reached, and the full procedural schedule takes place, it is anticipated that new rates would take
effect in early 2010.

Northern Indiana is seeking to offer DSM and energy efficiency programs to its electric customers
and, accordingly, in December 2008 filed a case-in-chief requesting approval to implement a variety
of DSM programs. Proposed programs include rebates for energy efficiency appliances and an
air-conditioning cycling program, designed to reduce peak load. The IURC is also reviewing a
program that would allow customers to reduce their cost of electricity by agreeing to interrupt
their service under some yet to be defined guidelines that would match rules established by MISO.

Northern Indiana included a commitment to using renewable energy in its IRP filed in November 2007,
and a subsequent filing was made with the IURC, requesting approval for Northern Indiana to enter
into power purchase agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind-generated power
from Iowa and South Dakota, and requesting full recovery of all associated costs. On July 24,
2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indiana’s proposed purchase power agreement with
subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables. The agreement provides Northern Indiana the opportunity to
purchase 100 mw of wind power, which began in early 2009.

On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for $329.7 million. This purchase was in
response to Northern Indiana’s need to add approximately 1,000 mw of new capacity. The Sugar Creek
facility is a CCGT located in West Terre Haute, Indiana and has a plant capacity rating of 535 mw.
Sugar Creek has transmission access to both the MISO and PJM Interconnection wholesale electricity
markets. In November 2008, an arrangement was reached to release Northern Indiana from its
contractual commitment binding the Sugar Creek power plant to provide capacity to PJM
Interconnection’s Reliability Pricing Model market. Effective December 1, 2008, Sugar Creek was
accepted as an internal designated network resource within the MISO.

Columbia of Ohio filed a base rate case with the PUCO on March 3, 2008, and a settlement agreement
was filed on October 24, 2008. In the base rate case, Columbia of Ohio sought recovery of
increased infrastructure rehabilitation costs, as well as the stabilization of revenues and cost
recovery through rate design. The agreement included an annual revenue increase of $47.1 million,
and also provides for recovery of costs associated with Columbia of Ohio’s infrastructure
rehabilitation program. On December 3, 2008, the PUCO approved the settlement agreement in all
material respects, and approved Columbia of Ohio’s proposed rate design. On January 2, 2009,
Columbia of Ohio filed a notice of its intent to adjust its Infrastructure Replacement Program
Rider, pursuant to the rate order, indicating that an application to adjust the rider would be
filed by February 27, 2009.

On January 15, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO requesting authority to
increase Columbia of Ohio’s PIPP rider rate. The application proposes to increase the PIPP rider
rate in order to collect $82.2 million in PIPP arrearages.

On April 9, 2008, the PUCO issued an order approving, in all material respects, a joint stipulation
submitted on behalf of Columbia of Ohio. This stipulation is a result of a process that began on
April 13, 2005 with a PUCO ordered investigation into the type of gas risers installed in the
state, the conditions of installation and overall performance. The stipulation provides for:
establishment of accounting for and recovery of costs resulting from the Staff’s investigation;
Columbia of Ohio’s performance of a survey to identify those customer-owned risers on its system
prone to failure; and related customer education and other program related expenses. In addition
this stipulation provides for: Columbia of Ohio’s assumption of financial responsibility for the
replacement of all risers identified as prone to failure; repair or replacement of hazardous
customer owned service lines; and capitalization of this investment with recovery to be addressed
in future rate proceedings.

Columbia of Ohio and other stakeholders reached an agreement in the fourth quarter of 2007 that
establishes the framework for operations under Columbia of Ohio’s CHOICE

a wholesale gas supply auction by early 2010. On January
23, 2008 the PUCO approved the agreement. The stipulation also included a commitment, on behalf of
Columbia of Ohio, to file on or before February 1, 2009 an application that proposes to implement
by no later than April 1, 2010 a wholesale auction procedure to secure the gas supply required to
serve its sales customers. Columbia of Ohio filed this application on January 30, 2009. Pursuant
to that application, Columbia of Ohio proposes to implement two consecutive one year long SSO
periods, starting in April 2010 with the intent to obtain commodity supplies for both Columbia of
Ohio’s PIPP and the SSO load. Columbia of Ohio will obtain gas supplies from alternative suppliers
and pass the price of that gas on to its sales customers at a monthly rate called the SSO rate.

In July 2008, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO for permission to create a new
comprehensive energy conservation program. If approved by the PUCO, Columbia of Ohio’s DSM program
would offer a wide range of services to residential and small commercial customers. Columbia of
Ohio proposes to recover the three-year, $24.9 million cost of the DSM conservation program through
a rider that would be added to residential and small commercial customer bills beginning in May
2010. On July 23, 2008, the PUCO issued an order approving Columbia of Ohio’s proposal subject to
the approval of the DSM cost recovery rider proposed in the currently pending rate case, and any
other conditions that may be imposed in the rate case. As part of its approval of the settlement
agreement in Columbia of Ohio’s rate case, the PUCO approved the DSM cost recovery rider.

On January 28, 2008, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the PPUC, and on July
2, 2008, Columbia of Pennsylvania and all interested parties filed a unanimous settlement. In
the base rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania sought to recover costs associated with its
significant infrastructure rehabilitation program, as well as stabilize revenues and cost
recovery through modifications to rate design. On October 23, 2008, the PPUC issued an Order
approving the settlement as filed, increasing annual revenues by $41.5 million. Included in
the annual revenue increase is consideration for costs associated with Columbia of
Pennsylvania’s infrastructure rehabilitation program.

On October 1, 2008, Columbia of Maryland filed a base rate case with the Maryland Public Service
Commission, and on February 20, 2009, Columbia of Maryland and all interested parties filed a
unanimous settlement in the case, recommending an annual revenue increase of $1.2 million. In
its initial filing, Columbia of Maryland sought an increase of $3.7 million annually.
Columbia of Maryland anticipates approval of the settlement and implementation of new rates in
the second quarter of 2009.

Refer to the “Results and Discussion of Segment Operations” for a complete discussion of regulatory
matters.

Bear Garden Station.

Columbia of Virginia has entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia
Power to install facilities to serve a 585 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham
County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project requires approximately 13.3 miles of
24-inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. The station is anticipated
to have an in-service date of September 1, 2010, and the total estimated cost for Columbia of
Virginia’s facilities is $51.0 million.

Commercial Growth and Expansion of the Gas Transmission and Storage Business

Millennium Pipeline Project

.

In June 2007, construction began on the Millennium pipeline, which
includes 182-miles of newly constructed, 30-inch-diameter pipe across New York’s Southern Tier and
lower Hudson Valley. Substantially all of the facilities related to the project were completed in
the fourth quarter of 2008 and the pipeline commenced service on December 22, 2008. Clean up work
along the right-of-ways will be completed in early 2009. Millennium will transport up to 525,400
Dth per day of natural gas to markets along its route, as well as to the New York City markets
through its pipeline interconnections. Millennium is jointly owned by affiliates of NiSource,
DTE Energy and National Grid.

Hardy Storage Project.

Hardy Storage is in service, receiving customer injections and withdrawing
natural gas from its new underground natural gas storage facility in West Virginia. Injections in
2008 allowed the field to deliver up to 150,000 Dth of natural gas per day during the 2008-2009
winter heating season. Customers withdrew over 5.44 Bcf from the storage field during the
2007-2008 winter heating season. When fully operational in 2009,
the field will have a working storage capacity of 12 Bcf, and the ability to deliver 176,000 Dth of
natural gas per day. Hardy Storage is a joint venture of subsidiaries of Columbia Transmission and
Piedmont.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Columbia Transmission, the operator of Hardy Storage, has expanded its natural gas transmission
system by 176,000 Dth per day to provide the capacity needed to deliver Hardy Storage supplies to
customer markets. Construction of these transmission facilities is complete and the facilities
were placed into service during April 2007.

Master Limited Partnership.

On December 21, 2007, NiSource Energy Partners, L.P., an MLP and
subsidiary of NiSource, filed a Form S-1 registration statement with the SEC in which it proposed
making an initial public offering of common units in the MLP and NiSource proposed contributing its
interest in Columbia Gulf to the MLP. NiSource management believes the formation of an MLP will be
a natural complement to NiSource’s gas transmission and storage growth strategy, and, if further
pursued, could provide NiSource access to competitively priced capital to support future growth
investment. The initial public offering did not occur in 2008 due to the damage sustained at
Columbia Gulf’s Hartsville, Tennessee, compressor station, following a tornado at the facility, as
well as overall financial market conditions. NiSource is in the process of withdrawing its
registration statement with the SEC due to market conditions and other internal and external
factors.

Florida Gas Transmission Expansion Project.

An open season to solicit interest and contracts for
expanded capacity on Columbia Gulf’s system for delivery to Florida Gas Transmission was held in
late 2007 and contracts for 100,000 Dth per day of capacity were executed. This project was placed
into service in May 2008.

Eastern Market Expansion Project

.

On May 3, 2007, Columbia Transmission filed a certificate
application before the FERC for approval to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and
transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities. This Eastern Market Expansion
project is projected to add 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability and is
fully subscribed on a 15-year contracted firm basis. On January 14, 2008, the FERC issued an order
which granted a certificate to construct the project. Construction of the facilities is underway
and the project is expected to be in service by April 2009.

Appalachian Expansion Project.

On February 29, 2008, Columbia Transmission filed an application
before the FERC for approval to build a new 9,470 hp compressor station in West Virginia. The
Appalachian Expansion Project will add 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity and is fully
subscribed on a 15-year contracted firm basis. On August 22, 2008, the FERC issued an order which
granted a certificate to construct the project. Construction is in progress and the project is
expected to be in service by the second half of 2009.

Financial Management of the Balance Sheet

NiSource’s interest expense decreased $22.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared
to last year. This decrease was due primarily to lower short-term interest rates and the
retirement late in 2007 of high cost debt associated with the Whiting Clean Energy facility.

Despite recent turmoil in business and financial markets, NiSource is committed to maintaining its
liquidity position. NiSource has been closely monitoring developments relative to the financial
crisis and has developed a plan to effectively manage through this period. Specifically, NiSource
has developed a liquidity plan which is multi-faceted and is intended to demonstrate to the
financial markets that the Company has multiple avenues for gaining access to the capital markets.

Key elements of the liquidity plan include:

•

Addressing critical funding requirements during calendar years 2009 and 2010,
including the resolution of the Tawney class action litigation in an amount not to
exceed $338.8 million; annual anticipated dividend payments of approximately $252
million; and debt maturities of $417.6 million in November 2009 and $932.4 million in
November 2010.

•

Reducing the Company’s total projected 2009 funding requirements from nearly $1
billion to approximately $500 million by reducing planned capital spending for 2009
from in excess of $1 billion to $800 million; and through a $250 million reduction in
working capital requirements for 2009;
To further improve the company’s liquidity position, NiSource recently put in place a
two-year term loan facility with a syndicate of banks which will expire in February
2011. Borrowings under the facility will have an effective cost of LIBOR plus 538 basis
points. The facility became effective on February 13, 2009, and currently has firm bank
commitments totaling $265 million. Under an



ITEM 7.

NiSource Inc.

accordion feature within the agreement,
the facility could potentially be expanded to as much as $500 million. It is currently
anticipated that the aggregate bank commitments under this facility will increase to
$350 million by April 2009.

•

NiSource is also working towards (i) issuing additional unsecured
corporate debt and (ii) issuing upto an aggregate of $350 million of
secured or unsecured debt at several of its subsidiary companies
during 2009.

•

During 2008, NiSource issued long-term debt of $500 million of 6.80% unsecured notes
that mature January 15, 2019 and $200 million of 6.15% unsecured notes that mature on
March 1, 2013.

•

In addition, on August 25, 2008, Northern Indiana converted all of the Jasper County
Pollution Control Bonds from a variable rate demand mode to a fixed rate mode, and
reoffered the bonds to external investors. As a result of the fixed rate conversion
and reoffering process, the weighted average interest rate is now fixed at 5.58%.
Northern Indiana also renewed its $200 million accounts receivable facility in December
2008.

NiSource will continue to closely monitor events in the credit markets, as well as overall economic
conditions in the nation and the markets we serve. Maintaining financial flexibility will remain a
key priority for NiSource.

Credit Ratings.

On December 16, 2008, Standard and Poor’s affirmed its senior unsecured ratings
for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB-; however, it changed the ratings outlook for NiSource and
all of its subsidiaries to negative from stable. On February 4, 2009, Moody’s Investors Services
affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other
subsidiaries. Moody’s outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is negative. On February 4, 2009,
Fitch lowered its senior unsecured ratings for NiSource to BBB- and for Northern Indiana to BBB.
Fitch’s outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue
to be investment grade, an additional downgrade by Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s or Fitch would
result in a rating that is below investment grade.

Process and Expense Management

IBM Agreement.

In December 2007, NiSource and IBM finalized a restructuring of their business
services agreement. Under the restructured agreement, IBM will primarily provide information
technology services, with a number of other business service functions to be transitioned back to
the NiSource organization. During 2008, certain Meter to Cash, Human Resources, Sales Center,
remaining Finance and Accounting (except for Accounts Payable) and Supply Chain Management support
services transitioned back to the company. NiSource has made a decision to transition certain
Accounts Payable functions to another service provider.

In January 2008, NiSource and IBM also agreed to move forward with the Indiana deployment of a Work
Management System. The Work Management System project will provide technologies that standardize,
integrate and support the transformation of processes and will eliminate inefficient manual work
processes while meeting regulatory/compliance standards. Implementation is expected in 2009.

2009 Outlook

Earnings from continuing operations for 2009 are expected to fall within a range of $1.00 to $1.10
per basic share. The most significant downward impact on NiSource’s near-term earnings outlook
relates to an increase in pension expense of approximately $100 million, or 24 cents per basic
share, in 2009 due to the deterioration in the value of plan assets in 2008. Interest expense is
also expected to increase over 2008 levels by approximately $50 million or 12 cents per basic
share.

Ethics and Controls

NiSource has had a long term commitment to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as
well as high standards for ethical behavior by its employees. NiSource’s senior management takes
an active role in the development of this Form 10-K and the monitoring of the company’s internal
control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue its mandatory ethics
training program in which employees at every level throughout the organization participate.

Refer to “Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting” included in Item 9A.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Results of Operations

The Consolidated Review information should be read taking into account the critical accounting
policies applied by NiSource and discussed in “Other Information” of this Item 7.

Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, NiSource reported income from continuing operations
of $369.8 million, or $1.35 per basic share, compared to $302.9 million, or $1.10 per basic share
in 2007. Income from continuing operations before the cumulative change in accounting principle
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 was $333.8 million, or $1.22 per basic share.

Including results from discontinued operations, NiSource reported 2008 net income of $79.0 million,
or $0.29 per basic share, 2007 net income of $321.4 million, or $1.17 per basic share, and 2006 net
income of $282.2 million, or $1.04 per basic share.

Comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow
for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. Therefore, increases in
these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no
impact on income from continuing operations. An increase in operating expenses of $17.5 million
for the 2008 year was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of
these tracked costs. In the 2007 period, an increase in operating expenses of $25.1 million for
trackers was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs.
These increases in 2008 and in 2007 were largely attributable to higher uncollectible accounts.

Net Revenues

NiSource analyzes the operating results using net revenues. Net revenues are calculated as revenues
less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization.) NiSource believes net
revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the
majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer
resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues.

Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales, excluding depreciation and
amortization) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, were $3,242.6 million, a $55.6 million
increase compared with 2007. The increase in net revenues is from higher Gas Distribution
Operations net revenue which increased by $62 million. This increase in net revenues was due
primarily to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate proceedings at Columbia of
Pennsylvania, Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Kentucky and Bay State of $21.9 million, increased
trackers of $17.5 million offset in expense, the impact of an adjustment for estimated unbilled
revenues of $14.6 million recorded by Northern Indiana in 2007, and colder weather of approximately
$9 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues decreased $2.1 million mainly due
to lower shorter-term transportation and storage services and commodity margin revenues of $24.0
million and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million, partially offset by increased
subscriptions for firm transportation services of $23.1 million related to new interconnects along
the Columbia Gulf pipeline system, deliveries from the Hardy Storage field and incremental demand
revenues on the Columbia Transmission system. Electric Operations net revenues decreased $5.7
million from 2007 a result of lower residential sales volumes and lower residential and commercial
margins of $19.5 million, lower wholesale transactions of $14.1 million, the impact of cooler
weather of approximately $12 million and $11.4 million of higher MISO related costs, partially
offset by the impact of a $33.5 million settlement in third quarter of 2007 related to the cost of
power purchased by Northern Indiana in 2006 and 2007 and the impact of a $10.9 million adjustment
for estimated unbilled electric revenues recorded in 2007. Other Operations net revenues were
essentially flat compared with 2007.

Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 were $3,187.0
million, a $104.3 million increase compared with 2006, which includes the impact of $25.1 million
of trackers discussed above. NiSource’s operating segments contributed to this overall increase in
net revenues as follows: Gas Distribution Operations net revenues increased $93.9 million; Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations increased $20.8 million; and Electric Operations decreased
$10.8 million. Net revenue increases from Gas Distribution Operations were primarily a result of
favorable weather of approximately $71 million, a $17.8 million increase in revenues from
regulatory trackers, which are primarily offset in operating expense and higher net revenues from
regulatory

initiatives and other service programs of $10.9 million, partially offset by a $14.6
million adjustment for estimated unbilled revenues. Net revenues increased within Gas Transmission
Operations as a result of increased firm
capacity reservation revenues of $19.8 million due in large part to the Columbia Gulf mainline
pipeline being fully subscribed in 2007. Electric Operations net revenues were negatively impacted
by a $33.5 million settlement related to the cost of power purchased by Northern Indiana in 2006
and 2007, lower industrial margins of $11.8 million, a $10.9 million adjustment for estimated
unbilled revenues and higher revenue credits of $5.1 million, which more than offset increases in
net revenues due to higher wholesale margins and volumes amounting to $19.6 million, favorable
weather of approximately $17 million, higher residential and commercial volumes attributable to
usage and increased customers of approximately $15.3 million and lower unrecoverable MISO costs of
$7.1 million.

Expenses

Operating expenses were $2,337.2 million in 2008, an increase of $57.5 million from the comparable
2007 period. This increase was primarily due to higher employee and administrative expenses of
$37.5 million, a $27.0 million increase in depreciation which includes an $8.3 million depreciation
expense adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second
quarter of 2008 and $6.6 million
of depreciation for the new Sugar Creek plant, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses
of $11.6 million and higher gross receipts and other taxes of $9.2 million. These increases in
expense were partially offset by an adjustment decreasing employee benefits expense by $12.7
million and lower legal reserves of $10.7 million. The $12.7 million adjustment decreasing
employee benefit expenses was due to a misclassification in 2007 of certain medical claims. This
adjustment had no impact on actual medical claims paid or coverage to benefit participants. The
higher generation and maintenance expenses were primarily attributable to a planned turbine and
boiler maintenance and a generator overhaul, as well as $4.1 million in incremental costs
associated with the Sugar Creek facility.

Operating expenses were $2,279.7 million in 2007, a $125.1 million increase from 2006, which
includes $25.1 million of increased expense that is recovered through trackers and corresponding
increases in net revenues (see discussion above). This increase was primarily due to higher
employee and administrative expenses of $66.9 million, higher expense within Electric Operations
for electric generation and storm damage restoration totaling $13.9 million, higher depreciation of
$8.7 million and increased other taxes of $12.9 million primarily due to property taxes. The
employee and administrative costs include payroll, benefits and higher corporate services costs
primarily related to the pricing structure under NiSource’s original business services arrangement
with IBM. In December 2007, NiSource and IBM finalized a restructuring of their business services
agreement. The restructured agreement provided that IBM would primarily provide information
technology services, while a number of other business service functions would be transitioned back
to the NiSource organization. The impact of the amended agreement with IBM included a settlement
charge of $9.8 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2007. These increases in expenses
were partially offset by the impact of a $17.0 million accrual recorded in fourth quarter of 2006
in conjunction with the BP contract revision.

Equity Earnings (Loss) in Unconsolidated Affiliates

Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates increased 2008 operating income by $12.3 million
compared to income of $9.4 million in 2007. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes
investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations business. Equity earnings increased $2.9 million due to higher AFUDC earnings from
Millennium partially offset by increased interest expense from Hardy Storage.

Equity Earnings (Loss) in Unconsolidated Affiliates increased 2007 operating income by $9.4 million
compared to a loss of $12.3 million in 2006. Equity earnings increased $21.7 million due to Hardy
Storage being placed in service in April 2007, higher AFUDC earnings from Millennium and the impact
of Millennium recording a $13.0 million reserve in 2006 related to vacated portions of the original
project.

Other Income (Deductions)

Other Income (Deductions) in 2008 reduced income $362.5 million compared to a reduction of $449.3
million in 2007. This decrease in other deductions of $86.8 million was mainly due to lower
interest expense, higher other income and a redemption premium of $40.6 million which reduced
income in 2007 related to the early extinguishment of long-term notes for Whiting Clean Energy.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Interest expense, net was $380.1 million for 2008 compared to $402.3 million for last year. This
decrease of $22.2 million was mainly due to lower short-term interest rates and credit facility
fees, and the retirement late in 2007 of high cost debt associated with the Whiting Clean Energy
facility. Other, net was income of $17.6 million for 2008 compared to a loss of $6.4 million for
the comparable 2007 period due to the sale of an investment and lower costs
associated with the sale of accounts receivable. On August 27, 2008, NiSource Development Company
sold its interest in JOF Transportation Company to Lehigh Service Corporation for a pre-tax gain of
$16.7 million. JOF Transportation Company held 40% interest in Chicago South Shore & South Bend
Railroad Co. and a 40% interest in Indiana Illinois Development Company, LLC.

Other Income (Deductions) in 2007 reduced income $449.3 million compared to a reduction of $397.8
million in 2006. This increase in other deductions of $51.5 million was mainly due to a redemption
premium of $40.6 million related to the early extinguishment of long-term notes for Whiting Clean
Energy and to higher short-term interest rates and credit facility fees.

Income Taxes

Income taxes increased by $20.9 million in 2008 as compared with 2007. The increase was due to
higher pre-tax income, offset by lower state income tax expense. The effective income tax rates
were 33.4%, 35.2%, and 35.6% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 1.8% decrease in the
overall effective tax rate in 2008 versus 2007 was primarily the result of a change in
Massachusetts state taxes discussed below. Income taxes decreased $19.7 million in 2007 as
compared with 2006, primarily due to lower pre-tax income. The 0.4% decrease in the overall
effective tax rate in 2007 versus 2006 is due to higher Section 199 deductions, lower regulatory
flow-through depreciation, and the capitalization of the tax impact of AFUDC-Equity to a regulatory
asset. These decreases were offset by increased state income tax expense.

On July 3, 2008, the Governor of Massachusetts signed into law a bill that significantly changed
the Massachusetts corporate income tax regime. Under the new law, which became effective for tax
years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, NiSource calculates its Massachusetts income tax
liability on a unitary basis, meaning that the income tax obligation to the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts is determined based on an apportioned share of all of NiSource’s income, rather than
just the income of NiSource’s subsidiaries doing business in Massachusetts. Because of NiSource’s
substantial operations outside of Massachusetts, the new law has the impact of reducing the
deferred income tax liability to Massachusetts. Under SFAS No. 109, NiSource must recognize the
impact of this tax law change in the quarter it is enacted. As a result, income tax expense and
deferred income tax were reduced by $14.9 million in 2008.

Discontinued Operations

Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $290.8 million, or $1.06 loss per basic share, in 2008,
income of $18.5 million, or $0.07 per basic share, in 2007, and a loss of $52.0 million, or $0.18
loss per basic share, in 2006.

The loss in 2008 is primarily attributable to an adjustment to the reserve for the Tawney
litigation discussed previously and losses from businesses disposed during the year. During 2008
NiSource recorded an after-tax loss of $108.2 million for the dispositions of Northern Utilities,
Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy. In addition, in the first quarter of 2008, NiSource
began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean
Energy as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $4.4 million and $9.0 million was
classified as discontinued operations for the year ended 2008 and 2007, respectively and a net loss
of $20.5 million was reclassified for 2006. In the third quarter of 2008, NiSource began
accounting for the operations of NiSource Retail Services as discontinued operations. As such, net
income from continuing operations of $0.8 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million was classified as
discontinued operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively.

Discontinued operations reflected income of $18.5 million, or $0.07 per basic share, in 2007, and
an after-tax loss of $52.0 million, or $0.18 loss per basic share, in 2006. The $18.5 million
of income from discontinued operations in 2007 includes net income from Northern Utilities,
Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy of $9.0 million, a $7.5 million reduction, net of
taxes, in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and $0.9 million in related interest,
net of taxes, associated with the issuance of additional tax guidance in the first quarter of
2007. The loss from discontinued operations in 2006 was primarily the result of an increase
to legal reserves and the sale of certain low-income housing investments.

NiSource Inc.

Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2006 of $0.4 million, net of taxes,
resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 123R. Refer to Note 15, “Stock-Based
Compensation,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 123R.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

A significant portion of NiSource’s operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas
transportation and electric distribution businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash
flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts
from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer
months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business
during the summer cooling season and external short-term and long-term financing, is used to
purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of
facilities.

Operating Activities

Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $585.3
million, a decrease of $171.9 million from a year ago. A $132.4 million increase in deferred taxes
primarily related to bonus depreciation was more than offset by changes in assets and liabilities.
The impacts of gas prices and weather significantly impact working capital changes. High gas
prices and 8% colder than normal weather in the distribution markets during the fourth quarter of
2008 resulted in higher than normal accounts receivable balances at year end. The average price of
gas and increased storage injections resulted in increased inventory levels year over year
requiring a use of cash. In addition, increases in regulatory assets, including a deferred
uncollectible expense to be recovered via the bad debt and PIPP recovery programs, and the pass
back to customers per the Columbia of Ohio stipulation generated a use of working capital.

Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding.

In 2009, NiSource expects to make contributions of
approximately $104 million to its pension plans and approximately $53 million to its postretirement
medical and life plans. NiSource’s pension assets have incurred a negative return of 30.3% from
asset values at December 31, 2007, which will have an impact on future pension cash contributions
and expense. In 2009, pension expense, net of amounts capitalized, is
projected to increase by approximately $100 million compared to 2008.

Tawney Settlement.

In 2008, NiSource paid $25 million related to the Tawney settlement and
complied with the settlement agreement requirement to fund an additional $60.5 million by January
13, 2009. NiSource expects to make the remaining payments in 2009 up to the total settlement amount
of $338.8 million. A letter of credit of $254 million was issued on January 13, 2009 to cover
these remaining payments. Refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” for additional information.

Investing Activities

As part of its efforts to strengthen its balance sheet and focus on its core regulated assets,
NiSource took a number of steps in 2008 to divest certain non-strategic assets. These included:

•

The completion of the sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corp.
for $201.6 million, including working capital.

•

The sale of the Whiting Clean Energy facility to BPAE for $216.7 million, including
working capital.

•

The disposition of certain non-strategic Columbia Gulf assets in the Gulf of Mexico
area.

Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities.

The tables below reflect actual capital
expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2006, 2007, and 2008 and estimates for
2009. The other investing activities related to equity investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage
is included within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations.

For 2008, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,306.6 million, an
increase of $542.7 million over 2007. A significant amount of the increase was due to higher
capital expenditures within Electric
Operations of $310.9 million. This increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the
Sugar Creek Generating Station.

Capital expenditures increased within Gas Distribution Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations by $83.4 million and $158.1 million, respectively. The increase within Gas Distribution
Operations segment was primarily due to higher expenditures in infrastructure replacement programs,
particularly in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The increase within the Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations segment was primarily due to new business initiatives to maintain and expand market
share in storage and interstate transportation.

For 2009 the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be
$800.0 million, which is $506.6 million lower than the 2008 capital program. This lower spending
is mainly due to a decrease in the acquisition of incremental electric generation capacity, reduced
spending on infrastructure replacement programs and lower expenditures for growth projects
primarily within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. The program is expected to be
funded through a combination of cash flow from operations and new long-term debt issuances during
2009.

NiSource received proceeds from the sale of Whiting Clean Energy, Northern Utilities, and Granite
State of $216.7 million, $187.3 million, and $14.3 million, respectively.

On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for $329.7 million. This purchase was in
response to Northern Indiana’s need to add approximately 1,000 mw of new capacity. Refer to Note
5, “Purchase of Sugar Creek Plant,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion.

Restricted cash was $286.6 million and $57.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
2007, respectively. The increase in restricted cash was due primarily to the change in forward gas
prices which resulted in increased margin deposits on open derivative contracts used within
NiSource’s risk management and energy marketing activities.

NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $46.7 million, $17.4 million, and $10.6
million related to hurricanes and other items in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Financing Activities

The following steps were taken during 2008 to secure financing and strengthen NiSource’s liquidity
position:

•

During the second quarter, NiSource issued $700 million
of senior unsecured debt.

•

In September 2008, NiSource supplemented its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that
extends to July 2011 with a new, six-month $500 million credit facility. That facility
helped ensure ample liquidity to accommodate the company’s seasonal cash flow requirements
and to provide near-term funding flexibility related to the Tawney settlement. On February
13, 2009, the six-month credit facility was terminated in conjunction with the closing of a
new two-year bank loan facility.

•

NiSource also refinanced $254 million in Northern Indiana Pollution Control Bonds in
August 2008 at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 5.58%, and renewed Northern
Indiana’s $200 million accounts receivable facility in December 2008.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Long-term Debt.

NiSource’s 2009 financing requirement of approximately $500 million includes the
refinancing of outstanding debt scheduled to mature in November 2009, as well as payments
associated with the Tawney settlement. NiSource plans to meet this requirement through a
combination of measures. First, the company plans to issue unsecured corporate debt up to $500
million. During February 2009, NiSource negotiated a two-year term loan facility with a syndicate
of banks maturing in February 2011. Borrowings under the facility will have an effective cost of
LIBOR plus 538 basis points. The initial closing of the facility occurred on February 13, 2009,
with a subsequent closing expected to take place in early April under an “accordion” feature under
which the facility can be expanded to $500 million prior to the final closing. NiSource has
received bank commitments totaling $265 million, with the ultimate level of the facility expected
to be up to $350 million. NiSource is also working towards (i)
issuing additional unsecured
corporate debt and (ii) issuing up to an aggregate of $350 million of
secured or unsecured debt at several of its subsidiary companies
during 2009.

During January 2009, NiSource repurchased $32.4 million of the $450.0 million floating rate notes
scheduled to mature in November 2009 and $67.6 million of the $1.0 billion 7.88% unsecured notes
scheduled to mature in November 2010.

During July 2008, Northern Indiana redeemed $24.0 million of its medium-term notes, with an average
interest rate of 6.80%.

On May 15, 2008, NiSource Finance issued $500.0 million of 6.80% unsecured notes that mature
January 15, 2019 and $200.0 million of 6.15% unsecured notes that mature on March 1, 2013. The
notes due in 2013 constitute a further issuance of the $345.0 million 6.15% notes issued February
19, 2003, and will form a single series having an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $545.0
million.

On December 31, 2007, Whiting Clean Energy redeemed $292.1 of its notes due June 20, 2011, having
an average interest rate of 8.30%. The associated redemption premium of $40.6 million was charged
to loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt. The redemption was financed with NiSource
borrowings.

On December 3, 2007, Capital Markets redeemed $72.0 million of its $75.0 million of 6.78% senior
notes due December 1, 2027. The notes contained a provision entitling holders to require Capital
Markets to purchase the notes at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest on December 1,
2007.

On October 31, 2007, Northern Indiana redeemed $24.0 million of its Variable Rate Demand Pollution
Control Refunding Bonds, Series 1988D, issued by Jasper County, Indiana on behalf of Northern
Indiana with a floating interest rate of 3.645% at time of redemption.

On August 31, 2007, NiSource Finance issued $800.0 million of 6.40%, 10.5-year senior unsecured
notes that mature March 15, 2018.

During August 2007, Northern Indiana redeemed $20.0 million of its medium-term notes with an
average interest rate of 6.77%.

During June 2007, Northern Indiana redeemed $12.0 million of its medium-term notes with an interest
rate of 7.25%.

During April 2007, NiSource redeemed $27.0 million of Capital Markets medium-term notes, with an
average interest rate of 7.49%.

Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds

.

Northern Indiana has seven series of Jasper County
Pollution Control Bonds with a total principal value of $254 million currently outstanding. Prior
to March 25, 2008, each of the series bore interest at rates established through auctions that took
place at either 7, 28, or 35 day intervals. Between February 13, 2008 and March 5, 2008, Northern
Indiana received notice that six separate market auctions of four series of the Jasper County
Pollution Control Bonds had failed. As a result, those series representing an aggregate principal
amount of $112 million of the Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds bore interest at default rates
equal to 15% or 18% per annum. Subsequent auctions were successful, but resulted in interest rates
between 5.13% and 11.0%, which were in excess of historical market rates. These auction failures
were attributable to the lack of

NiSource Inc.

liquidity in the auction rate securities market, largely driven by the turmoil in the bond
insurance market. The Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds are insured by either Ambac Assurance
Corporation or MBIA Insurance Corporation.

Northern Indiana converted all seven series of Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds from the
auction rate mode to a variable rate demand bond mode between March 25, 2008 and April 11, 2008 and
repurchased the bonds as part of the conversion process. Between April 11, 2008 and August 24,
2008, all of the Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds were held in Northern Indiana’s treasury.
On August 25, 2008, Northern Indiana converted all of the Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds
from a variable rate demand mode to a fixed rate mode, and reoffered the bonds to external
investors. As a result of the fixed rate conversion and reoffering process, the weighted average
interest rate is now fixed at 5.58%.

Northern Indiana reflected the Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds as an offset to long-term debt
within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet (unaudited) as of March 31 and June 30, 2008 upon
repurchase and the debt was considered extinguished per SFAS No. 140. As such, unamortized debt
expense of $4.6 million previously recorded under deferred charges and other was reclassified to a
regulatory asset. The Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008 reflects the
reissuance of the long term debt. The repurchase and the subsequent re-issuance of these bonds are
included under, “Financing Activities,” in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flow.

Credit Facilities.

During September 2008, NiSource Finance entered into a new $500 million
six-month revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital that expires
March 23, 2009. During July 2006, NiSource Finance amended its $1.25 billion five-year revolving
credit facility increasing the aggregate commitment level to $1.5 billion, extending the
termination date by one year to July 7, 2011, and reduced the cost of borrowing. These facilities
are designed to provide a reasonable cushion of short-term liquidity for general corporate purposes
and in anticipation of continuing volatile natural gas prices, as well as to provide for short-term
payment requirements related to the Tawney settlement. On February 13, 2009, the six-month credit
facility was terminated in conjunction with the closing of a new two-year bank term loan facility.

NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $1,163.5 million at December 31,
2008, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.09%, and borrowings of $1,061.0 million at December
31, 2007, at a weighted average interest rate of 5.43%.

As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, NiSource Finance had $87.3 million and $110.4
million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2008, $1.0
million of the $87.3 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate
bi-lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource Finance obtained during
February 2004. Of the remaining $86.3 million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding at
December 31, 2008, $83.5 million resided under NiSource Finance’s five-year credit facility and
$2.8 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution. An
additional letter of credit of $254 million was issued on January 13, 2009 to cover the remaining
payments related to the Tawney settlement.

As of December 31, 2008, an aggregate of $753.0 million of credit was available under both credit
facilities.

Debt Covenants.

NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five-year revolving credit
facility and the two-year term loan facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt
to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in the 2005 private placement
requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of
December 31, 2008, the ratio was 61.6%.

NiSource is also subject to certain other non-financial covenants under the revolving credit
facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on
NiSource’s assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests,
preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset
sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and/or transfer of NiSource’s assets to no more
than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a
cross-default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event
of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries
in a principal amount of $50 million or more.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

NiSource’s bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However,
NiSource’s bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured
payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on
NiSource’s assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests,
preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSource’s
consolidated net tangible assets.

Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables.

On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to
sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CORC, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement with Dresdner
Bank AG, also dated May 14, 2004, under the terms of which it sells an undivided percentage
ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. On July 1, 2006, the
agreement was amended to increase the program limit from $300 million to $350 million. The
agreement currently expires on June 26, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, $236.5 million of accounts
receivable had been sold by CORC compared to $202.4 million as of December 31, 2007.

Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping
and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives
a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services.

On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of
its trade receivables, as they originate, to NRC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana.
NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement with Citibank, N.A. under the terms of which it sells an
undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit.
The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. NRC’s
agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled expiration date of December 18, 2009,
and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2008, NRC had sold
$119.0 million of accounts receivable compared to $200.0 million as of December 31, 2007. Under
the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indiana’s debt
rating falls below BBB- or Baa3 by Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s, respectively.

Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and
cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which
provides adequate compensation, for such services.

Credit Ratings.

On December 16, 2008, Standard and Poor’s affirmed its senior unsecured ratings
for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB-; however, it changed the ratings outlook for NiSource and
all of its subsidiaries to negative from stable. On February 4, 2009, Moody’s Investors Services
affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other
subsidiaries. Moody’s outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is negative. On February 4,
2009, Fitch lowered its senior unsecured ratings for NiSource to BBB- and for Northern Indiana to
BBB. Fitch’s outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings
continue to be investment grade, an additional downgrade by Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s or Fitch
would result in a rating that is below investment grade.

Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased
collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB- by
Standard and Poor’s or Baa3 by Moody’s. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the
ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $30 million. In addition to agreements with
ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse
change” provisions that could result in additional credit support such as letters of credit and
cash collateral to transact business. In addition, under Northern Indiana’s trade receivables
sales program, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indiana’s debt rating
falls below BBB- or Baa3 by Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s, respectively.

NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for the fixed-rate
debt, interest is calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable-rate
debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2008. For 2009, NiSource
projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $460 million, which
includes $377.0 million of interest payments related to its long-term debt outstanding as of
December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, NiSource also had $1,163.5 million in short-term
borrowings outstanding.

NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline
business software requiring equal annual payments of $5.8 million over 10 years beginning in
January 2008. This agreement is recorded as a capital lease. Final acceptance of the software
installation was made on January 2, 2008 and the software was placed in service in September 2008.

NiSource’s subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical
quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent minimum quantities of
these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices.

In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indiana’s purchase power agreements with
subsidiaries of Iberdola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These
agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind
power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind
power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of
electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the
table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than
material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required
to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to
termination and the timing of the termination.

NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and
storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2009 to 2045, require
NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges.

On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide
business process and support functions to NiSource. During 2008, NiSource reassumed responsibility
for certain support functions including human resource administration, payroll, supply chain
(procurement), sales centers, and the majority of meter to cash operations (billing and
collections) while customer contact center operations and accounts payable

NiSource Inc.

functions were transitioned to different service providers. IBM has retained responsibility for
information technology operations. NiSource Corporate Services will continue to pay IBM for the
amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges
fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of
these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $618 million to IBM in
service fees and project costs over the remaining 6.5 year term, of which $3.7 million is reflected
as capital lease payments. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other
than material breach by IBM), NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could
include a breakage fee, repayment of IBM’s un-recovered capital investments, and IBM wind-down
expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to
termination and the timing of the termination.

NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business
process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries
through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate
Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable
charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage
of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $76.0 million to Vertex
Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining 6.5 year term. Upon termination of the
agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC),
NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $15.0 million.

Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation
services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various
periods through 2013 and are included within, “Other service obligations,” in the table of
contractual commitments.

Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products
and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under
this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a
combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various
performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana
terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty-year contract period. Estimated minimum
payments for this agreement are included within, “Other service obligations,” in the table of
contractual commitments.

NiSource’s expected payments related to other long-term liabilities includes employer contributions
to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2009. Plan contributions
beyond 2009 are dependant upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which
cannot be reliably estimated. In 2009, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately
$104 million to its pension plans and approximately $53 million to its postretirement medical
and life plans. Refer to Note 12, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Not included in the table above are $4.1 million of estimated federal and state income tax
liabilities, including interest, recorded in accordance with FIN 48. If or when such amounts may
be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, “Income Taxes,”
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court
for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSource’s
share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource has complied with its
obligations under the settlement agreement to fund $85.5 million to the qualified settlement fund
by January 13, 2009. NiSource has also complied with its obligation to provide a letter of credit
on January 15, 2009, securing the unpaid portion of the settlement and has submitted an agreed
order discharging the judgment to the trial court. Final cash payments will be made based upon
actual claims received, so no amounts have been included in the table above at this time.

NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to
long-term obligations classified as, “Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits,” on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets, other than those described above.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll,
sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $350
million in 2009. Under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,
NiSource is entitled to claim additional first year depreciation (“bonus” depreciation) equal to
50% of certain eligible 2009 capital expenditures. Tax deductions associated with the bonus
depreciation, along with income tax deductions related to settlement of the Tawney litigation, is
expected to reduce NiSource’s 2009 taxable income to near zero. As a result, no federal income tax
payments are included in the 2009 expected tax payments disclosed above.

NiSource, like many of its peers in the electric and gas utility industries, has filed with the IRS
for permission to deduct, for tax purposes, certain repair costs that have historically been
capitalized for book purposes under utility ratemaking practices and followed for tax purposes. If
granted, such method change would provide significant additional liquidity in the form of income
tax refunds for taxes paid in prior years and reductions in future year income tax payments.

Off Balance Sheet Items

As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements
providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries.
Such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit.

NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $497.4 million of commodity-related
payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy commodity contracts and to satisfy
requirements under forward gas sales agreements of current and former subsidiaries. These
guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial
transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the
commodity-related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $297.5 million, which guarantee
performance of the seller’s covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and
warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees
are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource
would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the
aforementioned guarantees is remote.

NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 19-A, “Guarantees and Indemnities,” in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSource’s off
balance sheet arrangements.

Market Risk Disclosures

Risk is an inherent part of NiSource’s energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly
and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk
involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify,
assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following
principal risks that are involved in NiSource’s energy businesses: commodity market risk,
interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi-faceted process
with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment
and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSource’s senior management takes an
active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that
require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification,
assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and
complex nature of the energy business, NiSource’s risk management policies and procedures
continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification.

Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSource’s market and credit
risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from
changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Commodity Price Risk

NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries’ operations involving
natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSource’s subsidiaries use derivatives,
including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative
energy trading activity.

Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSource’s rate-regulated subsidiaries
is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas
costs through the rate-making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments.
If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing
services without the benefit of the traditional rate-making process and may be more exposed to
commodity price risk. Some of NiSource’s rate-regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price
risk products to its customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage
under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products
and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.

During 2008 and 2007, a loss of $0.3 million and gain of $0.3 million, net of taxes respectively,
were recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted
for as hedges. All derivatives classified as a hedge are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with
any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as a regulatory asset
or liability per SFAS No. 71 as appropriate. During 2008 and 2007, NiSource did not reclassify any
amounts related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to
earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur. It is
anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge
contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $53.9 million of loss, net of taxes.
Refer to Note 9, “Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information on NiSource’s various derivative programs for managing
commodity price risk.

NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual
and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount
of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSource’s restricted cash balance, may fluctuate
significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets.

Interest Rate Risk

NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings
under revolving credit agreements and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are
indexed to short-term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to
changes in interest rates on fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of
long-term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in
short-term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short-term interest rates of 100
basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $25.0 million and $27.2
million for the years 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource
Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six
counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being
amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an
effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively.

NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics
of its outstanding long-term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance
entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million
with six counterparties having a 6 1/2-year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based
upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6-month BBA
LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of
the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009. On
September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreement
with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110 million.

On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in
a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11-year term. NiSource Finance
will receive payments



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6-month BBA
LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of
the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013.

As a result of these fixed-to-variable interest rate swap transactions, $1,050 million of NiSource
Finance’s existing long-term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates.

Credit Risk

Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSource’s business
activities. NiSource’s extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In
addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval
levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts.
Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent
of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or
counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before
the settlement date. For derivative related contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are
obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future
date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in
terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted
collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support.

As a result of the ongoing credit crisis in the financial markets, NiSource has been closely
monitoring the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap
counterparties. NiSource continues to evaluate the financial status of its banking partners
through the use of market-based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also
through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. As of December
31, 2008, the U.S. Treasury Department has injected approximately $243 billion into U.S. financial
institutions (the TARP Capital Purchase Program), in an attempt to improve the financial position
of U.S. banks.

Prior to the U.S. Treasury’s announcement of the TARP Capital Purchase Program and the announcement
of certain bank acquisitions as described above, the parent company of one of NiSource’s interest
rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, impacting the status of an outstanding swap in the notional amount of $110 million. As
a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed-to-variable interest rate swap
agreement with Lehman Brothers. NiSource Finance elected to terminate the swap when Lehman
Holdings Inc., guarantor under the applicable International Swaps and Derivatives Association
agreement, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an
event of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special
Financing Inc. The mark-to-market close-out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008
termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of
2008.

NiSource also reviewed its exposure to all other counterparties including the other interest rate
swap counterparties and concluded there was no significant risk associated with these
counterparties. NiSource will continue to closely monitor events in the credit markets, as well as
overall economic conditions in the nation and the markets we serve.

Fair Value Measurement

NiSource measures fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 157 for its financial assets and
liabilities. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input
that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSource’s financial assets and liabilities
include price risk assets and liabilities, available-for-sale securities and a deferred
compensation plan obligation.

Exchange-traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with
cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into
these valuations. Certain non-exchange-traded derivatives are valued using broker or
over-the-counter, on-line exchanges. In such cases, these non-exchange-traded derivatives are
classified within Level 2. Non-exchange-based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and
options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. The
company uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs
that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs
for the asset or liability, and market-corroborated



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by
correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term
of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in
less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in
the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the
instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of
derivative instruments that are not exchange-traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect
collateral agreements which reduce exposures.

Price risk management assets also include fixed-to-floating interest-rate swaps, which are
designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable-rate debt as
a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future
outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current
fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well
as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are
based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest-rate swaps are
categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value
calculation of the interest rate swap.

Refer to Note 18, “Fair Value Disclosures,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information on NiSource’s fair value measurements.

Market Risk Measurement

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates,
indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in
losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one-day VaR at a 95%
confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The
daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.2
million, $0.3 million and zero during 2008, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the
VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management
actions to reduce portfolio risk.

Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies” included in this Item 7 and Note 1-U, “Accounting for Risk
Management and Energy Marketing Activities,” and Note 9, “Risk Management and Energy Marketing
Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSource’s
risk management.

Other Information

Critical Accounting Policies

NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below
that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSource’s results of operations
and Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.

SFAS No. 71 provides that rate-regulated
subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of
the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the
costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that
such rates can be charged and collected. NiSource’s rate-regulated subsidiaries follow the
accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to
utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in
service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets
and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,955.3 million and $1,426.5
million at December 31, 2008, and $1,082.9 million and $1,425.5 million at December 31, 2007,
respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1-F, “Basis of Accounting for
Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its
costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the
criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write-down of all or a portion of
NiSource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is
approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally
accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during
such



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable
amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required
to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In management’s opinion, NiSource’s regulated
subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future.

Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets require
specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of
these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for
deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory
action amounted to $237.2 million at December 31, 2008. If NiSource determined that the amounts
included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be
required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts.

Accounting for Risk Management Activities.

Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the
fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation.
Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the
nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the
effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For
fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change
in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate-making process, the rate-regulated
subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize
such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows.
These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in
revenues through rates.

In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the
hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness
test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout
the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded
currently in earnings.

Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate
certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is
such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the
underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange-traded natural gas futures and options
contracts and over-the-counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its
natural-gas-related businesses. NiSource had $351.1 million and $127.4 million of price risk
management assets, of which $344.2 million and $113.5 million related to hedges, at December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively, and $475.0 million and $81.6 million of price risk management
liabilities, of which $405.0 million and $55.3 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2008 and
2007, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains (losses) recorded to accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, was a loss of $139.8 million and a gain of $7.6 million
at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Pensions and Postretirement Benefits.

NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and
other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, SFAS No. 88 and SFAS
No. 106, as amended by SFAS No. 158. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense
related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be
used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long-term returns on plan assets and employee
longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long-term nature of the
associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have
material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For
further discussion of NiSource’s pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, “Pension
and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Goodwill Impairment Testing

.

As of December 31, 2008, NiSource had $3.7 billion of goodwill on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, which was mainly due to the acquisition of Columbia.

In the quarters ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007, NiSource performed its annual impairment
test of goodwill associated with the purchases of Columbia, Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and
Kokomo Gas. SFAS No. 142 requires that the impairment test be performed through the application of
a two-step fair value test. The first step of



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

the test compares the fair values of the reporting units with the carrying amounts, including
goodwill. An impairment of goodwill results when there is an excess of book value over the fair
value of a reporting unit. The second step would then need to be performed to quantify the
impairment charge, if any, which would be measured by comparing the implied value of goodwill to
its carrying amount. The implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit is determined by
assigning the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as
if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of fair value of the
reporting unit over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value
of goodwill.

The results of the June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007 annual impairment tests indicated that no
impairment charge was required. For the purpose of testing for impairment of the goodwill recorded
in the acquisition of Columbia, the related subsidiaries were aggregated into two distinct
reporting units, one within the Gas Distribution Operations segment and one within the Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas are
each separate reporting units within the Gas Distribution Operations segment.

NiSource uses an income approach to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for the purposes
of this test. The method is generally based on a discounted cash flow valuation model that
incorporates internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating results to estimate a
fair value of each reporting unit. Determining fair value requires management to make a number of
judgments about assumptions and estimates used in the model that are subjective and include
unobservable inputs or assumptions. The use of alternate judgments and/or assumptions could have a
material impact on the financial statements.

Certain key assumptions include the five-year plan operating results, discount rates and the
long-term outlook for growth rates, among other items. The discount rate used, based on the
weighted average cost of capital was 6.76% in the June 30, 2008 annual impairment test, which was a
decrease from the prior year’s rate of 7.3%, due primarily to a decrease in the risk-free rate and
market risk premium. Operating income growth rates were 3.93% for the Columbia distribution
reporting unit and 3.49% for the Columbia transmission reporting unit in the 2008 test, which were
comparable to the growth rates used in the prior year.

NiSource continually monitors potential indicators of impairment to determine if any triggering
events are present that would require an impairment test more frequently than the annual test.

As of December 31, 2008, NiSource’s market capitalization was approximately $3.0 billion, while
NiSource’s net assets, inclusive of goodwill, were $4.7 billion. NiSource’s market capitalization
at June 30, 2008 of approximately $4.9 billion was above NiSource’s net asset value when the annual
impairment test was performed. In accordance with paragraph 28 of SFAS No. 142, NiSource
considered whether there were any events or changes in circumstances during the second half of 2008
that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of the reporting units below their
carrying amounts and necessitate another goodwill impairment test and concluded that there were
none. NiSource attributes the decline in its market capitalization primarily to the overall stock
market decline resulting from the credit crisis taking place in the United States and globally, and
not any fundamental change in NiSource’s regulated gas distribution and gas transmission and
storage businesses that comprise the reporting units for which goodwill is attributable.
NiSource’s stock price decline of 41.9% from December 31, 2007 compares to the overall declines of
the S&P Utilities Average and Dow Jones Industrial Average, of 31.5% and 33.8% respectively, over
the same twelve-month time period. The following events likely contributed to a greater decline in
NiSource’s stock price during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the
overall market and industry performance during the same period, but these events had no impact on
the goodwill bearing reporting units. On October 24, 2008, a West Virginia Circuit Court approved a
$380 million settlement for Tawney (a legal settlement related to discontinued operation entity,
CNR, which was sold in 2003.) NiSource’s share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8
million. This settlement as well as difficult credit markets likely
contributed to Standard & Poor’s changing
the outlook for NiSource to Negative. All rating agencies have classified NiSource as investment
grade. In addition, the Northern Indiana electric rate case was filed on June 27, 2008 and the
initial hearings began in January 2009. This is the first electric rate case in 20 years and is
causing further uncertainty in the market place that may be depressing NiSource’s stock price.
The entity involved in this rate case does not carry goodwill.

Given the lack of a fundamental change in the underlying businesses that carry goodwill and their
various assets, NiSource does not believe the decline in its stock price and the underlying reasons
for that decline are indicative of an actual decline in the company’s fair value of the underlying
assets.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

NiSource’s reportable entities with goodwill consist of regulated companies. Regulated recovery
rates and approved rate of returns allow for more predictable and steady streams of revenues and
cash flows which help mitigate the impacts that might otherwise be felt from the recessionary
trends seen in other industries and also adds more reliability to the cash flow forecasts used to
calculate fair value. NiSource reviewed its estimates and assumptions used in the discounted cash
flow model at June 30, 2008, noting that there are no significant changes that would be made in
light of the changing economic circumstances during the last half of the year. In addition, the
2008 operating results for the Gas Distribution Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations segments exceeded and were in line, respectively, with 2008 estimates used to calculate
fair value in the June 30, 2008 annual impairment test. Favorable rate case outcomes within Gas
Distribution Operations and growth projects and increased firm capacity reservation fees within Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations contributed to the favorable results.

It should also be noted that NiSource has demonstrated the ability to obtain credit as evidenced by
a new short-term credit facility of $500 million that was obtained on September 23, 2008, Northern
Indiana’s re-issuance of the Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds for $254 million on August 25,
2008 with a weighted average interest rate now fixed at 5.58%, and the renewal of Northern
Indiana’s $200 million accounts receivable facility in December 2008. In addition, during February
2009 NiSource negotiated a two-year term loan facility with a syndicate of banks maturing in
February 2011. Borrowings under the facility will have an effective cost of LIBOR plus 538 basis
points. The initial closing of the facility occurred on February 13, 2009, with a subsequent
closing expected to take place in early April under an “accordion” feature under which the facility
can be expanded to $500 million prior to the final closing. NiSource has received bank commitments
totaling $265 million, with the ultimate level of the facility expected to be up to $350 million.

NiSource’s intangible assets, apart from goodwill, consist of franchise rights, which were
identified as part of the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisition in February of
1999 of Bay State. These amounts were $330.6 million and $341.6 million, net of amortization of
$111.6 million and $100.6 million, at December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively, and are being
amortized over forty years from the date of acquisition. NiSource recorded amortization expense of
$11.0 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006 related to its intangible assets.

Refer to Notes 1-J and 6, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

Long-lived Asset Impairment Testing

. NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long-lived
assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under SFAS No.
71. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired as
per SFAS No. 144. When an asset’s carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash
flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the
asset’s fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1-K, “Long-lived Assets,” in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Contingencies.

A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental,
tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated.
Accounting for contingencies require significant management judgment regarding the estimated
probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and
associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and
regulations. Management’s assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of
future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates
and can have a material impact on NiSource’s results of operations and financial position. Refer
to Note 19, “Other Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.

Asset Retirement Obligations.

NiSource accounts for retirement obligations under the provisions of
SFAS No. 143, as amended by FIN 47, which require entities to record the fair value of a liability
for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted
market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value
techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash
flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit-adjusted risk free rates.
When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the
carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the
capitalized cost is depreciated

NiSource Inc.

over the useful life of the related asset. The rate-regulated subsidiaries defer the difference
between the amount recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected in rates as
required pursuant to SFAS No. 71 for those amounts it has collected in rates or expects to collect
in future rates. Refer to Note 7, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

Revenue.

Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed
to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include
estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of
commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income
upon delivery of the commodities.

Taxes.

NiSource accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109

.

Under SFAS No. 109,
deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement
and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates.

SFAS No. 109 also requires recognition of the additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities
for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking
purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or
liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the
ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily
represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS
No. 157 — Fair Value Measurements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 to define
fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and to expand disclosures about fair
value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not change the requirements to apply fair value in existing
accounting standards.

Under SFAS No. 157, fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in
which the reporting entity transacts. The standard clarifies that fair value should be based on
the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.

To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, SFAS No. 157 establishes a
fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value
into three levels. The level in the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of the fair value
hierarchy defined by SFAS No. 157 are as follows:

•

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical asset or
liabilities that the company has the ability to access as of the reporting date.

•

Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through corroboration
with observable market data.

•

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs, such as internally developed pricing models for
the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset or liability.

SFAS No. 157 became effective for NiSource as of January 1, 2008. The provisions of SFAS No. 157
are to be applied prospectively, except for the initial impact on the following three items, which
are required to be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the
year of adoption: (1) changes in fair value measurements of existing derivative financial
instruments measured initially using the transaction price under EITF Issue No. 02-3, (2) existing
hybrid financial instruments measured initially at fair value using the transaction price and (3)
blockage factor discounts. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have an impact on NiSource’s
January 1, 2008 balance of retained earnings and is not anticipated to have a material impact
prospectively.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-2, which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157
for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of non-financial assets and liabilities until fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2008. NiSource has elected to defer the adoption of the
nonrecurring fair value measurement disclosures of non-financial assets and liabilities.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-3, which clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 in
a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining
the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. The
FSP was effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which financial statements have not
been issued.

Refer to Note 18, “Fair Value Disclosures,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding the adoption of SFAS No. 157.

SFAS
No. 158 — Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158 to improve existing reporting for defined benefit
postretirement plans by requiring employers to recognize in the statement of financial position the
overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan, among other changes. In
the fourth quarter of 2006, NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158.

On January 1, 2007, NiSource adopted the SFAS No. 158 measurement date provisions requiring
employers to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the fiscal year-end. The pre-tax
impact of adopting the SFAS No. 158 measurement date provisions increased deferred charges and
other assets by $9.4 million, decreased regulatory assets by $89.6 million, decreased retained
earnings by $11.3 million, increased accumulated other comprehensive income by $5.3 million and
decreased accrued liabilities for postretirement and postemployment benefits by $74.2 million.
NiSource also recorded a reduction in deferred income taxes of approximately $2.6 million. In
addition, 2007 expense for pension and postretirement benefits reflects the updated measurement
date valuations. Refer to Note 12, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

SFAS
No. 159 — The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities — Including an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 which permits
entities to choose to measure certain financial instruments at fair value that are not currently
required to be measured at fair value. Upon adoption, a cumulative adjustment would be made to
beginning retained earnings for the initial fair value option remeasurement. Subsequent unrealized
gains and losses for fair value option items will be reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and should not be applied
retrospectively, except as permitted for certain conditions for early adoption. NiSource has
chosen not to elect to measure any applicable financial assets or liabilities at fair value
pursuant to this standard when SFAS No. 159 was adopted on January 1, 2008.

FIN
48 — Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48 to
reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement
requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, this interpretation requires
that a tax position meet a “more-likely-than-not recognition threshold” for the benefit of an
uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements and requires that benefit to be
measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon
ultimate settlement. The determination of whether a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold is based on whether it is probable of being sustained on audit by the
appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. Additionally,
FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2006.

On January 1, 2007, NiSource adopted the provisions of FIN 48. As a result of the implementation
of FIN 48, NiSource recognized a charge of $0.8 million to the opening balance of retained
earnings. Refer to Note 11, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.

FSP FIN 39-1 — FASB Staff Position Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39.

In April 2007, the
FASB issued FSP FIN 39-1 to amend paragraph 3 of FIN 39 to replace the terms

conditional contracts

and

exchange contracts

with the term

derivative instruments

as defined in SFAS No. 133. This FSP
also amends paragraph 10 of FIN 39 to permit a reporting entity to offset fair value amounts
recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral
against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same
counterparty under a master netting arrangement. This FSP became effective for NiSource as of
January 1, 2008. NiSource has not elected to net fair value amounts for its derivative instruments
or the fair value amounts recognized for its right to receive cash collateral or obligation to pay
cash collateral arising from those derivative instruments recognized at fair value, which are
executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. This is consistent with
NiSource’s current accounting policy prior to the adoption of this amended standard. NiSource
discloses amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral within “Restricted cash” and
amounts recognized for the right to return cash collateral within current liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8- FASB Staff Position Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 and FASB
Interpretation No. 46(R).

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 to
require public entities to provide additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets and
to provide additional disclosures related to an entities involvement with variable interest
entities. This FSP is effective for the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2008,
with early application encouraged. Refer to Note 10, “Variable Interest Entities and Equity
Investments,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS
No. 141R — Business Combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R to improve
the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of information that a reporting
entity provides in its financial reports regarding business combinations and its effects, including
recognition of assets and liabilities, the measurement of goodwill and required disclosures. This
Statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
on or after December 15, 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited. NiSource is currently reviewing
the provisions of SFAS No. 141R to determine the impact on future business combinations.

SFAS No. 160 — Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment of ARB
No. 51.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 to improve the relevance, comparability,
and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated
financial statements regarding non-controlling ownership interests in a business and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This Statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and earlier adoption is
prohibited. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of SFAS No. 160 to determine the impact
it may have on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

SFAS
No. 161 — Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging — an amendment of SFAS No. 133.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161 to amend and expand the disclosure requirements of
SFAS No. 133 with the intent to provide users of the financial statement with an enhanced
understanding of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how these derivatives are
accounted for and how the respective reporting entity’s financial statements are affected. SFAS
No. 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, and
earlier application is encouraged. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of SFAS No. 161
to determine the impact to its disclosures within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

FSP FAS 132(R)-1 — FASB Staff Position Amendment of FASB Statement No. 132(R)-1.

In December 2008,
the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1 to amend SFAS No. 132(R), to provide guidance on an employer’s
disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. FSP FAS
132(R)-1 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009 with earlier
adoption permitted. NiSource is currently reviewing the additional disclosure requirements to
determine the impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

International Financial Reporting Standards

On November 14, 2008, the SEC issued a proposed IFRS “roadmap” which outlines several milestones
that need to be addressed prior to making the adoption to IFRS mandatory by U.S. filers. In 2011,
the SEC will determine



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

whether to require mandatory adoption of IFRS for all U.S. issuers. According to the roadmap, large
accelerated filers, including NiSource, would be required to file IFRS financial statements in
2014.

The proposed accounting changes are complex and comprehensive and will involve converting technical
accounting and financial reporting to IFRS. In addition, converting to IFRS will involve changes
to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, information technology, tax,
treasury, legal, human resources, and contractual issues. During 2009, NiSource will begin to
develop a project plan to analyze the requirements of IFRS and the potential impact adoption would
have on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Environmental Matters

NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated
with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations,
certain LDCs and CER. More significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas
less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations
using mercury-containing measuring equipment.

The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination at known sites will depend upon many
factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, the range of technologies
that can be used for remediation, other potentially responsible parties and their financial
viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. NiSource’s environmental liability
includes those corrective action costs considered “probable and reasonably estimable” under SFAS
No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96-1. NiSource’s estimated remediation liability will be refined as
events in the remediation process occur and actual remediation costs may differ materially from
NiSource’s estimates due to the dependence on the factors listed above.

Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United
States and worldwide to reduce so-called “greenhouse gases” such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of
burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage
in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently
a participant in the EPA’s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in
developments related to efforts to potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

Bargaining Unit Contract

As of December 31, 2008, NiSource had 7,981 employees of which 3,388 were subject to collective
bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective
bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2008. The contract with Northern Indiana’s
bargaining unit employees expires on May 31, 2009. Also, Kokomo Gas reached an agreement to
replace the collective bargaining agreement that expired on February 15, 2009.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued)

Competition

Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor-owned, municipal, and cooperative electric
utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas
utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong
competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas.
Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial
markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates
are primarily driven by low-cost, coal-fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas
provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts
market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane-based heating which, over time, has
comprised a declining percentage of the overall market.

Market Conditions

Spot prices for the winter of 2008-2009 have been in the $5.35 — $7.10/Dth range. This is a
decrease when compared to the prices experienced during the winter of 2007-2008 that were in the
$6.50 — $10.00/Dth range. This decrease can be attributed mainly to increasing supply and a decline
in industrial demand that coincided with the economic slowdown that started in the middle of 2008.

Entering the 2008-2009 winter season, storage levels were comparable to the prior year and five
year average inventory levels. During the summer of 2008, prices ranged between $6.25 — $13.25/Dth
with the higher prices experienced early in the summer as storage players scrambled to re-fill
storage that had been depleted by the cold finish to the 2007-2008 winter.

All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state-approved recovery mechanisms that
provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as
pass-through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs
included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the
difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under-recovered or over-recovered gas
cost to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices,
throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a
result of higher gas cost.

The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non-traditional revenue sources within the
evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream
of the companies’ service territory, the sale of products and services in the company’s service
territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The
upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution
Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity.
The on-system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the
transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The
incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the
savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its
ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these
types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and
others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice
programs. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer choice opportunities, where customers can
choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its
jurisdictions.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued)

The Gas Distribution Operations segment’s capital expenditures and other investing activities were
$369.7 million in 2008 and are projected to be approximately $332.0 million in 2009. This
reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to lower spending on infrastructure
programs due to capital restraints brought about by the recent turmoil in the financial markets.
The increase in 2008 over 2007 was primarily due to higher expenditures in infrastructure
replacement programs, particularly in Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Bear Garden Station

Columbia of Virginia has entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install
facilities to serve a 585 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as
the Bear Garden station. The project requires approximately 13.3 miles of 24-inch steel pipeline
and associated facilities to serve the station. The station is anticipated to have an in-service
date of September 1, 2010, and the total estimated cost for Columbia of Virginia’s facilities is
$51.0 million.

Regulatory Matters

Significant Rate Developments.

Columbia of Ohio filed a base rate case with the PUCO on March 3,
2008, and a settlement agreement was filed on October 24, 2008. In the base rate case, Columbia of
Ohio sought recovery of increased infrastructure rehabilitation costs, as well as the stabilization
of revenues and cost recovery through rate design. The agreement included an annual revenue
increase of $47.1 million, and also provides for recovery of costs associated with Columbia of
Ohio’s infrastructure rehabilitation program. On December 3, 2008, the PUCO approved the
settlement agreement in all material respects, and approved Columbia of Ohio’s proposed rate
design. On January 2, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed a notice of its intent to adjust its
Infrastructure Replacement Program Rider, pursuant to the rate order, indicating that an
application to adjust the rider would be filed by February 27, 2009.

On January 15, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO requesting authority to
increase Columbia of Ohio’s PIPP rider rate. The application proposes to increase the PIPP rider
rate in order to collect $82.2 million in PIPP arrearages.

On January 28, 2008, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the PPUC, and on July
2, 2008, Columbia of Pennsylvania and all interested parties filed a unanimous settlement. In
the base rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania sought to recover costs associated with its
significant infrastructure rehabilitation program, as well as stabilize revenues and cost
recovery through modifications to rate design. On October 23, 2008, the PPUC issued an Order
approving the settlement as filed, increasing annual revenues by $41.5 million. Included in
the annual revenue increase is consideration for costs associated with Columbia of
Pennsylvania’s infrastructure rehabilitation program.

On October 17, 2007, Bay State petitioned the DPU to allow the company to collect an additional
$7.5 million in annual revenue related to usage reductions occurring since its last rate case. Bay
State also requested approval of a steel infrastructure tracker that would allow for recovery of
ongoing infrastructure replacement program investments. The DPU held hearings on this matter in
the first quarter of 2008 and issued an order denying Bay State’s petition on April 30, 2008.
NiSource has decided not to appeal this case, and continues to weigh its options. On July 16,
2008, the DPU issued an order in its generic decoupling proceeding for gas utilities. NiSource has
reviewed the generic order, and considers the DPU’s action favorable.

On October 1, 2008, Columbia of Maryland filed a base rate case with the Maryland Public Service
Commission, and on February 20, 2009, Columbia of Maryland and all interested parties filed a
unanimous settlement in the case, recommending an annual revenue increase of $1.2 million. In
its initial filing, Columbia of Maryland sought an increase of $3.7 million annually.
Columbia of Maryland anticipates approval of the settlement and implementation of new rates in
the second quarter of 2009.

Cost Recovery and Trackers.

A significant portion of the distribution companies’ revenue is
related to the recovery of gas costs, the review and recovery of which occurs via standard
regulatory proceedings. All states require periodic review of actual gas procurement activity to
determine prudence and to permit the recovery of prudently incurred costs related to the supply of
gas for customers. NiSource distribution companies have historically been found prudent in the
procurement of gas supplies to serve customers.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued)

Certain operating costs of the NiSource distribution companies are significant, recurring in
nature, and generally outside the control of the distribution companies. Some states allow the
recovery of such costs via cost tracking mechanisms. Such tracking mechanisms allow for
abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the distribution companies to implement charges and
recover appropriate costs. Tracking mechanisms allow for more timely recovery of such costs as
compared with more traditional cost recovery mechanisms. Examples of such mechanisms include gas
cost recovery adjustment mechanisms, tax riders, and bad debt recovery mechanisms.

Comparability of Gas Distribution Operations line item operating results is impacted by these
regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt
expenses. Increases in the expenses that are the subject of trackers result in a corresponding
increase in net revenues and therefore have essentially no impact on total operating income
results.

Certain of the NiSource distribution companies are embarking upon plans to replace significant
portions of their operating systems that are nearing the end of their useful lives. Those
companies are currently evaluating requests for increases in rates in order to allow recovery of
the additional capital expenditures required for such plans. Each LDC’s approach to cost recovery
may be unique, given the different laws, regulations and precedent that exist in each jurisdiction.

On April 9, 2008, the PUCO issued an order approving, in all material respects, a joint stipulation
submitted on behalf of Columbia of Ohio. This stipulation is a result of a process that began on
April 13, 2005 with a PUCO ordered investigation into the type of gas risers installed in the
state, the conditions of installation and overall performance. The stipulation provides for:
establishment of accounting for and recovery of costs resulting from the Staff’s investigation;
Columbia of Ohio’s performance of a survey to identify those customer-owned risers on its system
prone to failure; and related customer education and other program related expenses. In addition
this stipulation provides for: Columbia of Ohio’s assumption of financial responsibility for the
replacement of all risers identified as prone to failure; repair or replacement of hazardous
customer owned service lines; and capitalization of this investment with recovery to be addressed
in future rate proceedings. As of December 31, 2008, Columbia of Ohio has approximately $50.6
million in costs associated with the gas riser and customer service line programs recorded as a
regulatory asset and/or capitalized plant.

On December 28, 2007, Columbia of Ohio entered into a stipulation with the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel
and PUCO Staff and other stakeholders resolving litigation concerning a pending Gas Cost Recovery
audit of Columbia of Ohio. The stipulation calls for an accelerated pass back to customers of
$36.6 million, that will occur from January 31, 2008 through January 31, 2009, generated through
off-system sales and capacity release programs, the development of new energy efficiency programs
for introduction in 2009, and the development of a wholesale auction process for customer supply to
take effect in 2010. Approximately $30.2 million was passed back through December 31, 2008. The
stipulation also resolves issues related to pending and future Gas Cost Recovery Management
Performance audits through 2008. The PUCO approved this agreement on January 23, 2008.

Columbia of Ohio and other stakeholders reached an agreement in the fourth quarter of 2007 that
establishes the framework for operations under Columbia of Ohio’s CHOICE

®

program for
the next several years and provides for a wholesale gas supply auction by early 2010. On January
23, 2008 the PUCO approved the agreement. The stipulation also included a commitment, on behalf of
Columbia of Ohio, to file on or before February 1, 2009 an application that proposes to implement
by no later than April 1, 2010 a wholesale auction procedure to secure the gas supply required to
serve its sales customers. Columbia of Ohio filed this application on January 30, 2009. Pursuant
to that application, Columbia of Ohio proposes to implement two consecutive one year long SSO
periods, starting in April 2010 with the intent to obtain commodity supplies for both Columbia of
Ohio’s PIPP and the SSO load. Columbia of Ohio will obtain gas supplies from alternative suppliers
and pass the price of that gas on to its sales customers at a monthly rate called the SSO rate.

In July 2008, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO for permission to create a new
comprehensive energy conservation program. If approved by the PUCO, Columbia of Ohio’s DSM program
would offer a wide range of services to residential and small commercial customers. Columbia of
Ohio proposes to recover the three-year, $24.9 million cost of the DSM conservation program through
a rider that would be added to residential and small commercial customer bills beginning in May
2010. On July 23, 2008, the PUCO issued an order approving

Columbia of Ohio’s proposal subject to the approval of the DSM cost recovery rider proposed in the
currently pending rate case, and any other conditions that may be imposed in the rate case. As
part of its approval of the settlement agreement in Columbia of Ohio’s rate case, the PUCO approved
the DSM cost recovery rider.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of
December 31, 2008, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions.
Refer to Note 19-D, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment.

Sale of Northern Utilities

On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to
Unitil Corporation for $201.6 million including $41.6 million for working capital. The working
capital amount will be adjusted based upon the final settlement during the first quarter of 2009.
Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44
communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting
for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $6.2
million, $5.3 million and $4.9 million from continuing operations for Northern Utilities, which
affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued
operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Refer to Note 4,
“Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the company’s larger
acquisition of Bay State. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Bay State as a core component of
the company’s long-term, investment-driven growth strategy.

Weather

In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer
demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree-days. Normal is evaluated using
heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for
measuring heating degree-days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load
begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62
degrees.

Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2008 was approximately 2% colder
than normal and 5% colder than 2007, increasing net revenues by approximately $9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007.

Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2007 was approximately 3% warmer
than normal and 11% colder than 2006, increasing net revenues by approximately $71 million for the
year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006.

Throughput

Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2008 were 923.2 MMDth, compared
to 907.3 MMDth for 2007. This increase reflected higher sales to residential and commercial
customers attributable mainly to cooler weather and higher off-system sales.

Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2007 were 907.3 MMDth, compared
to 814.0 MMDth for 2006. This increase reflected higher sales to residential, commercial, and
industrial customers, which was attributable mainly to cooler weather, an increase in residential
and commercial customers and usage, and higher off-system sales.

Net Revenues

Net revenues for 2008 were $1,537.6 million, an increase of $62.0 million from 2007. This increase
in net revenues was due primarily to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate
proceedings at Columbia of Pennsylvania, Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Kentucky and Bay State of
$21.9 million, the impact of an adjustment for estimated unbilled revenues of $14.6 million
recorded by Northern Indiana in 2007, increased

trackers of $13.1 million offset in expense, colder weather of approximately $9 million and
increased residential usage of $4.0 million, partially offset by reduced industrial and commercial
margins and usage of $9.0 million. The $21.9 million increase from regulatory and service programs
is inclusive of a $9.3 million decrease in net revenues associated with the implementation of the
Columbia of Ohio Stipulation entered into with the Ohio Consumers Counsel and the PUCO at the end
of 2007.

Net revenues for 2007 were $1,475.6 million, an increase of $93.9 million from 2006. This increase
in net revenues was due primarily to the impact of colder weather amounting to approximately $71
million, a $17.8 million increase in revenues from regulatory and tax trackers which are primarily
offset in operating expense, increased revenues from regulatory initiatives and other service
programs of $10.9 million and approximately $8 million from customer growth. These increases in
net revenues were partially offset by an adjustment for estimated unbilled revenues of $14.6
million. Northern Indiana detected an error in its unbilled revenue calculation and revised its
estimate for unbilled electric and gas revenues in the fourth quarter of 2007. Over a period of
several years, Northern Indiana used incorrect customer usage data to calculate its unbilled
revenue. The unbilled revenue estimates were never billed to customers and the error was corrected
in the fourth quarter of 2007.

Operating Income

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations
segment was $334.9 million, an increase of $9.9 million compared to the same period in 2007
primarily attributable to increased net revenues described above, partially offset by higher
operating expenses of $52.1 million. The increase in operating expenses includes $13.1 million of
expenses recoverable through regulatory and tax trackers which are offset in revenues, of which
$6.6 million is for an increase in tracked tax expense. Operating expenses also increased
primarily due to higher employee and administrative costs of $21.3 million, increased outside
service and supplies expense of $5.3 million, higher depreciation expense of $4.5 million and
increased gross receipts and other operating taxes (excluding the impact of trackers) of $4.0
million. Employee and administrative costs increased as a result of higher payroll costs for
increased headcount, cost of living and performance adjustments, and higher corporate services
costs related to information technology and consulting.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations
segment was $325.0 million, an increase of $41.6 million compared to the same period in 2006
primarily attributable to increased net revenues described above, partially offset by higher
operating expenses of $52.3 million. The increase in operating expenses includes $17.8 million of
expenses recoverable through regulatory and tax trackers that are primarily offset in revenues.
Operating expenses also increased primarily due to higher employee and administrative costs of
$26.7 million, increased outside service expense of $5.2 million, higher environmental reserves of
$5.0 million, and increased property taxes of $4.5 million. The comparable period last year was
impacted by transition expenses associated with the IBM agreement of $8.5 million partially offset
by a reversal of a restructuring reserve for leased office space of $5.2 million. The employee and
administrative costs include payroll, benefits and higher corporate services costs primarily
related to the pricing structure under NiSource’s original business services arrangement with IBM.

Millennium Pipeline Project

The Millennium pipeline, which includes 182-miles of newly constructed, 30-inch-diameter pipe
across New York’s Southern Tier and lower Hudson Valley, was substantially completed in the fourth
quarter of 2008 and the pipeline commenced service on December 22, 2008. Construction on the
pipeline began in June, 2007. Millennium’s completed design allows it to transport up to 525,400
Dth per day of natural gas to markets along its route, as well as to the New York City metropolitan
area and the Northeast via pipeline interconnections. Some clean-up activities remain on the
right-of-ways for the pipeline which will be completed in the spring of 2009. The Millennium
partnership is currently comprised of Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (26.25%), and
KeySpan Millennium (26.25%) with Columbia Transmission acting as operator.

On August 29, 2007, Millennium entered into a bank credit agreement to finance the construction of
the Millennium pipeline project. As a condition precedent to the credit agreement, NiSource issued
a guarantee securing payment for its indirect ownership interest percentage of amounts borrowed
under the financing agreement up until such time as the amounts payable under the agreement are
paid in full. The permanent financing for Millennium is expected to be completed when debt capital
market conditions improve. As of December 31, 2008, Millennium borrowed $798.9 million under the
interim bank credit agreement, which extends through August 2010. Additional information on this
guarantee is provided in Note 19-A, “Guarantees and Indemnities,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Hardy Storage Project

Hardy Storage is in service, receiving customer injections and withdrawing natural gas from its new
underground natural gas storage facility in West Virginia. Injections in 2008 allowed the field to
deliver up to 150,000 Dth of natural gas per day during the 2008-2009 winter heating season.
Customers withdrew over 5.44 Bcf from the storage field during the 2007-2008 winter heating season.
When fully operational in 2009, the field will have a working storage capacity of 12 Bcf and the
ability to deliver 176,000 Dth of natural gas per day. Hardy Storage is a joint venture of
subsidiaries of Columbia Transmission and Piedmont.

Columbia Transmission, the operator of Hardy Storage, has expanded its natural gas transmission
system to provide the capacity needed to deliver Hardy Storage supplies to customer markets.
Construction of these transmission facilities is complete and the facilities were placed into
service during April 2007.

NiSource Energy Partners, L.P.

On December 21, 2007, NiSource Energy Partners, L.P., an MLP and subsidiary of NiSource, filed a
Form S-1 registration statement with the SEC in which it proposed making an initial public offering
of common units in the MLP and NiSource proposed contributing its interest in Columbia Gulf to the
MLP. NiSource management believes the formation of an MLP will be a natural complement to
NiSource’s gas transmission and storage growth strategy, and, if further pursued, could provide
NiSource access to competitively priced capital to support future growth investment. The initial
public offering did not occur in 2008 due to the damage sustained at Columbia Gulf’s Hartsville,
Tennessee compressor station following the tornado at the facility as well as overall financial
market conditions. NiSource is in the process of withdrawing its registration statement with the
SEC due to market conditions and other internal and external factors.

Florida Gas Transmission Expansion Project

An open season to solicit interest and contracts for expanded capacity on Columbia Gulf’s system
for delivery to Florida Gas Transmission was held in late 2007 and contracts for 100,000 Dth per
day of capacity were executed. This project was placed into service in May 2008.

Eastern Market Expansion Project

On January 14, 2008, the FERC issued an order which granted a certificate to construct the project.
The project allows Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage
and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities. This Eastern Market
Expansion is projected to add 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability and
is fully subscribed on a 15-year contracted firm basis. Construction of the facilities is underway
and the project is expected to be in service by April 2009.

Appalachian Expansion Project

On August 22, 2008, the FERC issued an order to Columbia Transmission, which granted a certificate
to construct the project. The project specifies building a new 9,470 hp compressor station in West
Virginia. The Appalachian Expansion Project will add 100,000 Dth per day of transportation
capacity and is fully subscribed on a 15-year contracted firm basis. Construction is in progress
and the project is expected to be in service by the second half of 2009.

Ohio Storage Project

On June 24, 2008, Columbia Transmission filed an application before the FERC for approval to expand
two of its Ohio storage fields for additional capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of
daily deliverability. If required approvals are granted as requested, construction would begin in
2009 and the expanded facilities would be placed in service by the middle of 2009. The expansion
capacity is 58% contracted on a long-term, firm basis.

Centerville Expansion Project

An open season to solicit interest and receive bids for expanded capacity on Columbia Gulf’s system
for delivery to Southern Natural Gas and the Louisiana intrastate pipeline market was held during
the first quarter of 2008, and bids for 60,000 Dth per day of capacity were submitted. The
remaining 175,000 Dth per day of capacity is expected to be sold under firm contracts prior to the
facilities being placed into service. The project is expected to be placed into service in late
2010.

MarkWest Energy Partners, LP Joint Venture Project

In August 2008, Columbia Transmission and MarkWest Energy Partners, LP, announced their intention
to jointly develop several natural gas gathering and processing projects to support increased
natural gas production in the Appalachian Basin. The two companies are in discussions with several
natural gas producers to provide new gathering and gas processing services in association with
Columbia Transmission’s existing Majorsville, WV, compressor station, located in the northern
panhandle area of West Virginia and Western Pennsylvania.

Columbia Penn Project

In September 2008, Columbia Transmission announced its intention to develop additional natural gas
transmission, gathering and processing services along and around its existing pipeline corridor
between Waynesburg, PA, and Renovo, PA, referred to as the “Columbia Penn” corridor. This
two-phased development will accelerate access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production
increases in the Marcellus Shale formation which underlies Columbia Transmission’s transmission and
storage network in the region. Phase I is anticipated to give customers access to capacity in
early 2009, while Phase II would be available by the end of 2009.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment’s capital expenditure program and other
investing activities are projected to be approximately $290.2 million in 2009. The decrease in
capital is due to a reduction in storage and transportation growth projects.

Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold

Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of
service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and
Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm
contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management
seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts.

Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between
certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a “capacity reservation” fee
based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an
incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from
firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues
are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high
percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue
fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near-term
supply and demand conditions. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 approximately 90.1% of
the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts
and 5.3% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is
compared to approximately 87.4% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation
fees paid under firm contracts and 4.9% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under
firm contracts for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007.

Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by
customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service.
These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to
provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and
customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline
facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive
prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service
is viewed by management

as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For the twelve
months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately 4.6% and 7.7%, respectively, of the
transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts.

Significant FERC Developments

On November 6, 2008, the FERC issued an order approving a stipulation and Consent Agreement entered
into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf (collectively the Columbia Pipelines) with the
FERC’s Office of Enforcement. The Settlement resolves any and all matters related to: (a) a
preliminary, non-public investigation commenced on January 25, 2005 into the Columbia Pipelines’
provision of the PAL Investigation; and (b) an outstanding audit by the FERC’s Office of Market
Oversight and Investigations, the predecessor of FERC’s Office of Enforcement, commenced on
September 30, 2003 in Docket No. PA03-16, and a subsequent preliminary, non-public investigation,
related to the audit. The Columbia Pipelines cooperated with the FERC’s investigations.

To resolve the Docket No. PA03-16 audit the settlement provided for the Columbia Pipelines to pay a
civil penalty of $1.0 million to the United States Treasury. To resolve the PAL Investigation,
Columbia Transmission disgorged profits in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the amount of $9.0 million
to firm and interruptible gas transportation customers and to make several non-public compliance
reports. The Columbia Pipelines neither admitted nor denied the FERC’s Office of Enforcement’s
allegations.

Hartsville and Delhi Compressor Stations

On February 5, 2008, tornados struck Columbia Gulf’s Hartsville Compressor Station in Macon County,
Tennessee. The damage to the facility forced Columbia Gulf to declare force majeure because no gas
was flowing through this portion of the pipeline system while a facility assessment was being
performed and the current contractual transportation agreements of 2.156 Bcf per day could not be
met. Since that time, Columbia Gulf has constructed both temporary and permanent facilities at
Hartsville. On July 19, 2008, the station completed the installation of temporary horsepower and
restored capacity to flow up to 2.156 Bcf per day. During the next 12 to 14 months, the temporary
facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities will be replaced with a permanent
solution.

NiSource expects to incur an additional $30.2 million in reconstruction costs for the compressor
station and ancillary facilities in addition to the $47.0 million in costs incurred in 2008. Damage
claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008 for a total of $77.5 million, of which $30.1
million was received in the current year after a $1.0 million deductible. Amounts received were all
attributable to capital repairs. As of December 31, 2008, Columbia Gulf had an insurance receivable
of $47.4 million related to the damages, which includes $1.7 million for business interruption and
gas lost.

On December 14, 2007, Columbia Gulf’s Line 100 ruptured approximately two miles north of its Delhi
Compressor Station in Louisiana. The damage to the pipeline forced Columbia Gulf to declare force
majeure because no gas was flowing through this portion of the pipeline system on Lines 100, 200
and 300 while a facility assessment was performed. One day later, Lines 200 and 300 were returned
to service and gas flow was restored on December 16, 2007. On December 19, 2007, the DOT issued a
Corrective Action Order. The Order required Columbia Gulf to develop a remedial work plan to
restore Line 100 pipeline’s pressure and capacity. Between December 22, 2007 and June 30, 2008,
the Line 100 pipeline operated at less than full pressure and full capacity. On July 1, 2008,
Columbia Gulf received permission from the DOT to restore full pressure and full capacity on the
Line 100 pipeline. Columbia Gulf continues to operate under this Order.

Costs of $2.9 million to repair damages on Line 100 were recognized when they were incurred
predominantly in 2008. After a $1.0 million deductible, insurance settlements totaled $1.8
million, of which $1.5 million was received in 2008. Amounts received for capital repairs totaled
$1.3 million and $0.2 million for operating and maintenance expenses. As of December 31, 2008,
Columbia Gulf had an insurance receivable of $0.3 million related to the damages. The business
interruption insurance claim is expected to be resolved in the first quarter 2009.

On May 26, 2005, Columbia Gulf experienced a catastrophic engine failure at the company’s Delhi,
Louisiana, Compressor Station. Delhi is the third compressor station on Columbia Gulf’s 845-mile
long mainline that stretches from near Lafayette, La., to the Kentucky/West Virginia state line,
bringing natural gas from offshore and onshore Louisiana to markets throughout the eastern United
States. The station was repaired and placed back into full service



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

NiSource Inc.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued)

on January 15, 2007. Costs incurred to repair the compressor station totaled $3.1 million in 2005,
$24.7 million in 2006, and $1.7 million in 2007. Insurance settlements, after a $1.0 million
deductible, totaled $13.8 million that included $4.0 million for business interruption in 2007 and
$10.2 million in 2006, which included $1.9 million for business interruption.

Hurricanes

In September 2004, hurricane Ivan damaged certain Columbia Gulf property and in the third quarter
of 2005, Columbia Gulf incurred additional damages to its pipeline assets and facilities as a
result of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Total costs recorded to repair damages in 2008, 2007, and
2006 were $7.4 million, $12.1 million and $42.3 million, respectively.

Columbia Gulf is covered by insurance for these damages, subject to a $1.0 million deductible per
incident. Insurance covers capital repairs, operating and maintenance expenses, and business
interruption. Insurance claims were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million that included $1.0
million in business interruption. For the year ended December 31, 2008, Columbia Gulf received
$16.8 million of insurance proceeds. Amounts received of $13.4 million were for capital repairs
and $3.4 million for operating and maintenance expenses.

In 2007 and 2006, Columbia Gulf had received $8.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in
insurance recoveries, net of deductibles, related to these damages under its insurance policies.
Amounts received for capital repairs totaled $3.8 million and $1.8 million and for operating and
maintenance expenses totaled $4.7 million and $2.2 million for the same respective periods.
Columbia Transmission received insurance proceeds in 2006 for hurricane Ivan of $0.5 million for
capital repairs and $0.7 million for operating and maintenance expenses. Costs to repair damages
are recognized when costs are incurred or as information becomes available to estimate the damages
incurred.

As of December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, Columbia Gulf had a receivable of $14.1 million, $43.4
million, and $39.8 million related to the hurricanes. Amounts recoverable through insurance are
recorded within Accounts Receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
segment. As of December 31, 2008, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental
response actions. Refer to Note 19-D, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations segment.

Sale of Granite State Gas

On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to
Unitil Corporation for $201.6 million including $41.6 million for working capital. The working
capital amount will be adjusted based upon the final settlement during the first quarter of 2009.
Granite State Gas is an 86-mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine
and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of
Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million, zero and $0.4
million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and
Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Refer to Note 4, “Discontinued Operations
and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.

NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the company’s larger
acquisition of Bay State.

Restructuring Plan

On
February 27, 2009, NiSource announced an organizational restructuring
of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. NiSource will
be eliminating approximately 370 to 380 positions across the 16 state
operating territory of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. The
reductions will occur through normal attrition as well as through
voluntary programs and involuntary separations. In addition to the
employee reductions, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations will take
steps to achieve additional cost savings by efficiently managing its
various business locations, reducing its fleet operations, creating
alliances with third party service providers, and implementing other
changes in line with its strategic plan for growth and in response to
current economic conditions. The new structure will allow Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations to operate safely and reliably
while serving customers in a more effective and cost efficient
manner. NiSource expects to incur pre-tax restructuring charges of
approximately $25 million to $30 million, which primarily includes
costs related to severance and other employee related costs. The
majority of these charges will be incurred during the first quarter
of 2009.

Throughput

Columbia Transmission’s throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and
other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid-Atlantic,
midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf
reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short-haul
transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads Pipeline

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued)

serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered
to other pipelines within this segment.

Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,521.8 MMDth for 2008,
compared to 1,390.5 MMDth in 2007. The increase of 131.3 MMDth is due primarily to increased
transportation deliveries on Columbia Transmission related to Hardy Storage field operations being
in service for a full year, as well as incremental throughput from new interconnects along the
Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission pipeline systems. Columbia Gulf, in tandem with Columbia
Transmission, renewed several key long-term contracts during 2008 and remains fully subscribed on
the mainline going north.

Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,390.5 MMDth for 2007,
compared to 1,151.1 MMDth in 2006. The increase of 239.4 MMDth is due primarily to transportation
relating to strong market area storage injections, higher transport usage by natural gas fired
electric power generators, enhanced market access through new pipeline interconnects and the
addition of new natural gas supply attached to the system at Perryville, Louisiana.

Net Revenues

Net revenues were $865.3 million for 2008, a decrease of $2.1 million from 2007. The decrease in
net revenues was mainly due to lower shorter-term transportation and storage services and commodity
margin revenues of $24.0 million, the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million and
insurance proceeds from a business interruption claim that improved last year’s results by $2.6
million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by increased subscriptions for firm
transportation services of $23.1 million related to new interconnects along the Columbia Gulf
pipeline system, deliveries from the Hardy Storage field and incremental demand revenues on the
Columbia Transmission system as well as from a $5.3 million impact from contract buyouts, a $4.4
million increase in trackers that are offset in expense, and insurance proceeds from business
interruption claims of $2.1 million.

Net revenues were $867.4 million for 2007, an increase of $20.8 million from 2006. The increase in
net revenues was mainly due to higher subscriptions for firm transportation services of $19.8
million and a $7.3 million increase in revenues from regulatory trackers, which are offset in
operating expense. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by a decrease in
shorter-term transportation services and storage optimization revenues of $5.9 million.

Operating Income

Operating income of $369.7 million in 2008 increased $7.7 million from 2007 primarily due to a
decrease in operating expenses of $6.9 million and higher equity earnings of $2.9 million,
partially offset by a decrease in net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased as a
result of $10.7 million in lower legal reserves, the impact of a $7.2 million impairment charge
recognized in the comparable 2007 period related to base gas at a storage field, $3.1 million in
lower insurance costs and $2.4 million of lower uncollectible accounts. These decreases in
operating expenses were partially offset by higher employee and administrative costs of $10.0
million, an $8.3 million loss on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf and $4.4
million of increased tracked expenses that are offset in revenues. Employee and administrative
costs increased as a result of higher corporate services costs related to information technology
and consulting, and increased payroll costs including cost of living and performance adjustments.
Equity earnings increased by $2.9 million due to higher AFUDC earnings associated with Millennium
partially offset by increased interest expense associated with Hardy Storage.

Operating income of $362.0 million in 2007 increased $21.5 million from 2006 primarily due to the
increase in net revenues described above and equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates of $9.4
million for 2007 compared to a loss of $12.3 million in unconsolidated affiliates in the 2006
period, partially offset by increased operating expenses of $21.0 million. Equity earnings in
unconsolidated affiliates increased $21.7 million due to Hardy Storage being placed in service in
April 2007, higher AFUDC earnings from Millennium and the impact of Millennium recording a reserve
in 2006 related to vacated portions of the original project. Operating expenses increased
primarily as a result of higher employee and administrative costs of $14.1 million, a $7.2 million
impairment charge related to base gas at a storage field and increased tracker expenses of $7.3
million, which are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. The employee and administrative
costs include payroll, benefits and higher corporate services costs primarily related to NiSource’s
business services arrangement with IBM. These increases in operation and

maintenance expenses were partially offset by a $6.4 million reduction of a reserve for legal
matters and the impact of a $4.6 million expense recognized in 2006 related to the settlement of a
certain legal matter.

On November 1, 2007, Northern Indiana filed its bi-annual IRP with the IURC. The plan showed the
need to add approximately 1,000 mw of new capacity. On May 28, 2008, Northern Indiana was granted
a CPCN for the purchase of a 535 mw CCGT and related assets through the acquisition of the equity
interests in Sugar Creek Power Company, LLC and the merger of Sugar Creek into Northern Indiana.
On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased the facility for $329.7 million. Because the Sugar
Creek facility was committed to the PJM Interconnection Market until May 31, 2010, the order denied
treatment of the facility as “used and useful” for ratepayers until such time it would be
dispatchable into the MISO Market. In addition, the order denied deferral treatment of
depreciation and carrying charges related to the plant. On December 1, 2008, Northern Indiana was



ITEM 7.

Electric Operations (continued)

able to terminate the commitment to PJM and dispatch the facility into MISO. See Significant Rate
Developments below.

On October 24, 2008, Northern Indiana issued two requests for proposals to secure additional new
sources of electric power to meet the future needs of its residential, commercial and industrial
customers. The first request seeks capacity and energy proposals for up to 300 mw of electricity
to address Northern Indiana’s projected electricity supply needs during the 2011 to 2016 time
period. The second request seeks up to 300 mw of electricity generated from renewable sources
and/or DSM technologies to address Northern Indiana’s projected electricity supply needs beginning
in 2011.

Market Conditions

Northern Indiana’s mwh sales to steel-related industries accounted for approximately 63.6% of the
total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. Northern Indiana’s
industrial sales volumes and revenues showed a modest increase for the first half of 2008 as
compared to 2007, declining approximately 20% in the second half of 2008 due to the dramatic changes
in the world economy mid to late 2008. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing
market conditions. Predominant factors are ongoing industry consolidation, fluctuating demand,
increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and manufacturing input costs not fully
covariant to steel sales prices whereby integrated steel manufacturers face margin volatility. In
the fourth quarter of 2008, the industry responded to decreased steel demand by idling capacity
throughout the world. Steel industry production levels are presently down over 50% from the
production levels of early 2008.

The Electric Operations segment’s capital expenditure program and other investing activities are
projected to be approximately $175.3 million in 2009. The decrease in capital is mainly due to no
currently forecasted expenditures for acquisition of incremental electric generation capacity. The
increase in capital expenditure in 2008 compared to 2007 was due to the purchase of Sugar Creek for
$329.7 million.

Regulatory Matters

Significant Rate Developments.

Northern Indiana filed a petition for new electric base rates and
charges on June 27, 2008 and filed its case-in-chief on August 29, 2008. The filing requested a
two-step increase. The first step request was for an increase of approximately $24 million. The
second step was for an additional increase of approximately $81 million to incorporate the return
on and recovery of the Sugar Creek facility. Such increase was expected to become effective at the
date of dispatch of Sugar Creek by MISO. On December 1, 2008, Northern Indiana successfully
dispatched Sugar Creek into MISO, simultaneous with the termination of its PJM commitment. As a
result, a revised case-in-chief was filed on December 19, 2008, incorporating Sugar Creek and
resulting in a traditional one-step case, requesting an increase in base rates calculated to
produce additional gross margin of $85.7 million annually. Evidentiary hearings on Northern
Indiana’s direct case commenced on January 12, 2009 and concluded on February 6, 2009. Several
stakeholder groups have intervened in the case, representing customer groups and various counties
and towns within Northern Indiana’s electric service territory. A field hearing allowing customers
to individually participate will occur on March 3, 2009. The OUCC and intervenors are scheduled
to file their cases-in-chief by April 17, 2009. Northern Indiana is scheduled to file its rebuttal
testimony in June 2009, and final hearings are planned to begin July 27, 2009. If a settlement
agreement is not reached, and the full procedural schedule takes place, it is anticipated that new
rates would take effect in early 2010.

In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In the electric
base rate case discussed above, Northern Indiana provided testimony that it intends to retire the
Mitchell station, demolish it, and remediate the site to industrial condition, subject to the
ability to recover these costs.

During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate
review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement.
The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will
receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year. The credits will continue at
approximately the same annual level and per the same methodology, until the IURC enters a base rate
order that approves revised Northern Indiana electric rates. The order included a rate moratorium
that expired on July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a
specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated
based on electric usage; therefore, in times of high usage the credit may be more than $55.1
million. Credits amounting to $53.9 million, $56.0 million and $50.9 million were recognized for
electric customers for the years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

MISO.

As part of Northern Indiana’s participation in the MISO transmission service and wholesale
energy market, certain administrative fees and non-fuel costs have been incurred. IURC orders have
been issued authorizing the deferral for consideration in a future rate case proceeding of the
administrative fees and certain non-fuel related costs incurred after Northern Indiana’s rate
moratorium, which expired on July 31, 2006. During 2008 non-fuel costs of $2.3 million were
deferred in accordance with the aforementioned orders. In addition, administrative, FERC and other
fees of $6.6 million were deferred. In total, for 2008 and 2007, MISO costs of $8.9 million and
$9.9 million, respectively, were deferred. In the base rate case filed in August 2008, Northern
Indiana proposed recovery over a three year amortization period of the cumulative amount of charges
that will have been deferred by the time a rate order is issued, and a tracker for recovery of
these charges on an ongoing basis.

On April 25, 2006, the FERC issued an order on the MISO’s Transmission and Energy Markets Tariff,
stating that MISO had violated the tariff on several issues including not assessing revenue
sufficiency guarantee charges on virtual bids and offers and for charging revenue sufficiency
guarantee charges on imports. The FERC ordered MISO to perform a resettlement of these charges
back to the start of the Day 2 Market. The resettlement began in July 2007 and ended in January
2008. Certain charge types included in the resettlement were originally considered to be non-fuel
and were recorded as regulatory assets, in accordance with previous IURC orders allowing deferral
of certain non-fuel MISO costs. During the fourth quarter 2007, based on precedent set by an IURC
ruling for another Indiana utility, Northern Indiana reclassified these charges, totaling $16.7
million, as fuel and included them in the fuel cost recovery mechanism in its latest FAC filing.
Prior to the hearing for FAC-78 on April 17, 2008, several intervenors objected to a portion of the
$16.7 million and Northern Indiana agreed to remove $7.6 million from the FAC filing. This amount
represents the portion of the resettlement costs related to periods prior to December 9, 2005. The
$7.6 million was recorded as a reduction to net revenues in the first quarter of 2008.

On November 7, 2008, the FERC issued an order regarding the clarification of a rate mismatch as it
pertains to the RSG First Pass calculation. On November 10, 2008, the FERC issued an order
indicating that the RSG rates in effect were unjust and unreasonable based on a Section 206 filing
that Northern Indiana and Ameren jointly filed on August, 10, 2007. MISO determined that
resettlements are required for all periods from market start to the Section 206 Refund effective
date to remedy the rate mismatch. The FERC ordered refunds with interest after August 10, 2007.
MISO, in its compliance filing, indicated it will perform another resettlement to recalculate the
RSG First Pass Distribution Rate. These resettlements will begin in the first quarter of 2009 and
will conclude by the first quarter of 2010. As the result of these resettlements, Northern Indiana
will see a shift from RSG Second Pass, which is a non fuel charge, as determined from a previous
IURC order, to the RSG First Pass Distribution, which is included as part of the fuel cost
mechanism. The interim RSG allocation is still subject to rehearing. Northern Indiana does not
expect a material impact on the financial statements.

Northern Indiana is an active stakeholder in the process used in designing, testing and
implementing the ASM and in developing the surrounding business practices. On January 18, 2008,
Northern Indiana as part of a Joint Petition among several other Indiana utilities “Joint
Petitioners” filed a request to the IURC to participate in ASM and seek approval of timely cost
recovery for the associated costs of participating. On August 13, 2008, the IURC issued a Phase I
order, authorizing the Joint Petitioners authority to transfer additional balancing authority
functions and to

implement the operational changes necessary to participate in the ASM and to seek recovery of
modified MISO charge-types via the FAC and to defer certain other MISO charge-types, pending a
final determination on the issue of cost recovery. This order also created a subdocket for the
purpose of further consideration of whether a cost-benefit analysis of participation in MISO or the
MISO ASM should be required. Phase II of this proceeding deals with how the Joint Petitioners will
approach the ASM, specifically related to operating reserves, and the specifics regarding cost
recovery. The evidentiary hearing for Phase II concluded on February 9, 2009. The market began on
January 6, 2009. At this time, Northern Indiana is not yet able to determine what impact the ASM
will have on its operations or cash flows.

Cost Recovery and Trackers.

A significant portion of the Northern Indiana’s revenue is related to
the recovery of fuel costs to generate power and the fuel costs related to purchased power. These
costs are recovered through a FAC, a standard, quarterly, “summary” regulatory proceeding in
Indiana. Various interveners, including the OUCC, have taken issue with costs included in Northern
Indiana’s FAC-80 filed in the summer of 2008, and the IURC has granted a sub-docket in this
proceeding. The intervening parties and Northern Indiana are discussing procedures to eliminate
these concerns. There is no procedural schedule established for this sub-docket.

On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for $329.7 million. This purchase was in
response to Northern Indiana’s need to add approximately 1,000 mw of new capacity. The Sugar Creek
facility is a CCGT located in West Terre Haute, Indiana and has a plant capacity rating of 535 mw.
Sugar Creek has transmission access to both the MISO and PJM Interconnection wholesale electricity
markets. In November 2008, an arrangement was reached to release Northern Indiana from its
contractual commitment binding the Sugar Creek power plant to provide capacity to PJM
Interconnection’s Reliability Pricing Model market. Effective December 1, 2008, Sugar Creek was
accepted as an internal designated network resource within the MISO.

The IURC issued an order on May 28, 2008 approving the purchase of Sugar Creek, but denied Northern
Indiana’s request for deferral of depreciation expense and carrying costs related to the plant,
beginning with the acquisition date, on the basis that the facility would not be used and useful
property under traditional regulation until the facility was operating inside of MISO. The order
also denied Northern Indiana’s request for alternative regulatory treatment of the plant, based on
incomplete presentation of evidence, but provided for the establishment of a subdocket to allow for
the proper presentation and consideration of alternative regulatory treatment. On June 6, 2008,
Northern Indiana filed its (a) Verified Petition for Rehearing; (b) Request for Establishment of a
Subdocket for Presentation and Consideration of an Alternative Regulatory Plan; and (c) Motion for
Consolidation (a single document) in Cause No. 43396. The IURC established a subdocket for
consideration of Northern Indiana’s Alternative Regulatory Plan. Northern Indiana’s case-in-chief
was filed with the IURC on September 26, 2008. The IURC, on February 18, 2009, issued an order
approving a settlement agreement filed in this proceeding allowing
Northern Indiana to begin deferring carrying costs and depreciation on Sugar Creek effective on December 1, 2008 at the
agreed to carrying cost rate of 6.5%. The terms of recovery of the deferral will be resolved in
Northern Indiana’s current rate proceeding.

Northern Indiana included a commitment to using renewable energy in its IRP filed in November 2007,
and a subsequent filing was made with the IURC, requesting approval for Northern Indiana to enter
into power purchase agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind-generated power
from Iowa and South Dakota, and requesting full recovery of all associated costs. On July 24,
2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indiana’s proposed purchase power agreement with
subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables. The agreement provides Northern Indiana the opportunity to
purchase 100 mw of wind power, which began in early 2009.

As part of a settlement agreement which resolved issues surrounding purchased power costs, Northern
Indiana implemented a new “benchmarking standard,” that became effective in October 2007, which
defines the price above which purchased power costs must be absorbed by Northern Indiana and are
not permitted to be passed on to ratepayers. The benchmark is based upon the costs of power
generated by a hypothetical natural gas fired units using gas purchased and delivered to Northern
Indiana and a set sharing mechanism. During the twelve months of 2008, the amount of purchased
power costs exceeding the benchmark amounted to $11.1 million, which was recognized as a net
reduction of revenues. The agreement also contemplated Northern Indiana adding generating capacity
to its existing portfolio by providing for the benchmark to be adjusted as new capacity is added.
The



ITEM 7.

OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Electric Operations (continued)

dispatch of Sugar Creek into MISO on December 1, 2008 triggered a change in the benchmark, whereby
the first 500 mw tier of the benchmark provision was eliminated.

On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC for an ECT. Under the ECT,
Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended
by Northern Indiana to implement IDEM’s NOx SIP through an ECRM and (2) related operation and
maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through
an EERM. Under the IURC’s November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings
on a semi-annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. In December 2006,
Northern Indiana filed a petition with the IURC for appropriate cost treatment and recovery of
emission control construction needed to address the Phase I CAIR requirements of the Indiana Air
Pollution Control Board’s CAIR rules that became effective on February 25, 2007. On July 3, 2007,
Northern Indiana received an IURC order issuing a CPCN for the CAIR and CAMR Phase I Compliance
Plan Projects, estimated to cost approximately $23 million. Northern Indiana includes the CAIR and
CAMR Phase I Compliance Plan costs to be recovered in the semi-annual and annual ECRM and annual
EERM filing six months after construction costs begin. On October 23, 2008, Northern Indiana filed
for approval of a revised cost estimate to meet the NOx and SO2 and mercury emissions environmental
standards. Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment of approximately $368 million.
This revised cost estimate was approved by the IURC on January 14, 2009. On October 1, 2008, the
IURC approved ECR-12 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $267.7 million.
Northern Indiana filed ECR-13 and EER-6 in February 2009, for net capital expenditures and expense
of $270.0 million and $18.7 million, respectively. In the electric base rate case, Northern
Indiana has proposed that the frequency of the EERM be changed from annual to semi-annual,
simultaneous with the filing of the ECRM. In addition, Northern Indiana proposed that the EERM be
used to pass through to ratepayers the cost of any emission allowance purchases and the proceeds of
any emission allowance sales.

In its electric base rate case filed in August 2008 and also in the December 19, 2008 revised
filing, Northern Indiana proposed a new tracker, referred to as the Reliability Adjustment
mechanism. The case proposes recovery over a three year amortization period of the cumulative
amount of charges that will have been deferred by the time a rate order is issued, and a tracker
for recovery of these charges on an ongoing basis. This tracker is also intended to be used to
recover purchased power energy and capacity costs and to share with ratepayers the proceeds of any
off-system sales and transmission revenues.

Northern Indiana is seeking to offer DSM and energy efficiency programs to its electric customers
and, accordingly, in December 2008 filed a case-in-chief requesting approval to implement a variety
of DSM programs. Proposed programs include rebates for energy efficiency appliances and an
air-conditioning cycling program, designed to reduce peak load. The IURC is also reviewing a
program that would allow customers to reduce their cost of electricity by agreeing to interrupt
their service under some yet to be defined guidelines that would match rules established by MISO.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December
31, 2008, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to
Note 19-D, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment.

Sales

Electric Operations sales were 17,442.5 gwh for the year 2008, a decrease of 370.6 gwh compared to
2007, mainly resulting from lower residential sales due to cooler weather and decreased usage, as
well as from decreased industrial sales and wholesale volumes, partially offset by higher
commercial sales.

Electric Operations sales were 17,813.1 gwh for the year 2007, an increase of 384.8 gwh compared to
2006, mainly resulting from increased residential sales due to warmer weather and increased usage,
increased wholesale volumes and customer growth.

Net Revenues

Electric Operations net revenues were $805.9 million for 2008, a decrease of $5.7 million from
2007. This decrease was primarily a result of lower residential sales volumes and lower
residential and commercial margins of $19.5 million, lower wholesale transactions of $14.1 million,
the impact of cooler weather of approximately $12 million, $11.4 million of higher MISO related
costs and $8.0 million of non-recoverable purchased power. These decreases in net revenues were
partially offset by the impact of a $33.5 million settlement in third quarter of 2007 related to
the cost of power purchased in 2006 and 2007, the impact of a $10.9 million adjustment for
estimated unbilled electric revenues recorded in 2007, $6.2 million in increased industrial net
revenues and incremental revenues of $6.1 million from the new Sugar Creek facility.

Electric Operations net revenues were $811.6 million for 2007, a decrease of $10.8 million from
2006. This decrease was primarily a result of a $33.5 million settlement related to the cost of
power purchased in 2006 and 2007, a $10.9 million adjustment for estimated unbilled electric
revenues, lower industrial margins and usage of $11.8 million and higher revenue credits of $5.1
million, due to the timing of the credits, and $3.2 million of non-recoverable purchase power
incurred in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of the settlement discussed above under,
“Regulatory Matters.” Northern Indiana detected an error in its unbilled revenue calculation and
revised its estimate for unbilled electric and gas revenues in the fourth quarter of 2007. Over a
period of several years, Northern Indiana used incorrect customer usage data to calculate its
unbilled revenue. The unbilled revenue estimates were never billed to customers and the error was
corrected in the fourth quarter of 2007. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by
higher wholesale margins and volumes of $19.6 million, favorable weather of approximately $17
million, higher residential and commercial volumes attributable to usage and increased customers of
$15.3 million and lower unrecoverable MISO costs of $7.1 million.

Operating Income

Operating income for 2008 was $219.2 million, a decrease of $42.3 million from 2007. The decrease
in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $36.6 million and lower net revenues
described above. Operating expenses increased primarily due to a $17.6 million increase in
depreciation which includes an $8.3 million depreciation expense adjustment recorded during the
second quarter of 2008, higher employee and administrative costs of $11.8 million, higher electric
generation and maintenance expenses of $7.5 million and $4.1 million of incremental costs
associated with the Sugar Creek facility, partially offset by lower property taxes of $3.9 million.
Employee and administrative costs increased as a result of higher payroll costs for increased
headcount and cost of living and performance adjustments. The higher generation and maintenance
expenses were primarily attributable to a planned turbine and boiler maintenance and a generator
overhaul.

Operating income for 2007 was $261.5 million, a decrease of $48.9 million from 2006. The decrease
in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $38.1 million and lower net revenues
described above. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher employee and administrative
expense of $29.0 million, higher electric generation expense of $9.6 million, higher storm damage
restoration costs amounting to $4.3 million and higher depreciation expense of $4.6 million,
partially offset by lower MISO administrative expenses of $3.0 million. The employee and
administrative costs include payroll, benefits and higher corporate services costs primarily
related to NiSource’s business services arrangement with IBM.

. On June 30, 2008, NiSource sold Whiting Clean
Energy to BPAE for $216.7
million, which included $16.1 million in working capital. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource
began accounting for the operations of Whiting Clean Energy as discontinued operations. As such, a
net loss of $2.4 million, net income of $3.7 million and net loss of $25.7 million was included as
net income or loss from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively. Refer to Note 4, “Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for
Sale,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Lake Erie Land Company, Inc.

Lake Erie Land, which is wholly-owned by NiSource, is in the process of selling real estate over a
10-year period as a part of an agreement reached in June 2006 with a private real estate
development group. Part of the sale transaction included the assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club,
and NiSource began accounting for the operations of the Sand Creek Golf Club as discontinued
operations at that time. NiSource estimates the property to be sold to the private developer
during the next twelve months and classifies these assets as assets of discontinued operations and
held for sale.

NDC Douglas Properties, Inc.

NDC Douglas Properties, a subsidiary of NiSource Development Company, is in the process of exiting
some of its low income housing investments. Two of these investments were disposed of during 2006
and one in 2007. Two other investments are expected to be sold or disposed of during 2009.
NiSource has accounted for the investments to be sold as assets and liabilities of discontinued
operations and held for sale. An impairment loss of $2.3 million was recorded in the second
quarter of 2006, due to the current book value exceeding the estimated fair value of these
investments.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Other Operations segment. As of December 31,
2008, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note
19-D, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment.

Net Revenues

For the year ended 2008, net revenues were $29.6 million, an increase of $0.2 million from 2007.
The increase was a result of higher commercial and industrial gas marketing revenues.

For the year ended 2007, net revenues were $29.4 million, a decrease of $0.7 million from 2006.
The decrease was a result of lower commercial and industrial gas marketing revenues.

NiSource Inc.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of NiSource Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements of consolidated
long-term debt of NiSource Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
and the related consolidated statements of income, of common stockholders’ equity and comprehensive
income (loss), and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008.
Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 8. These
financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial
statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also,
in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27,
2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of NiSource Inc.:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of NiSource Inc. and subsidiaries
(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting at Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control
— Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2008, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2009
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.

ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

A. Company Structure and Principles of Consolidation.

NiSource, a Delaware corporation, is a
holding company whose subsidiaries provide natural gas, electricity and other products and services
to approximately 3.8 million customers located within a corridor that runs from the Gulf Coast
through the Midwest to New England. NiSource is a holding company under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 2005. NiSource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the
operating results of its fifteen direct subsidiaries.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NiSource and its majority-owned
subsidiaries after the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. Investments for
which at least a 20% interest is owned, certain joint ventures and limited partnership interests of
more than 3% are accounted for under the equity method. Except where noted above and in the event
where NiSource has significant influence, investments with less than a 20% interest are accounted
for under the cost method. NiSource also consolidates variable interest entities for which
NiSource is the primary beneficiary.

B. Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

C. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash.

NiSource considers all investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. NiSource reports amounts deposited in
brokerage accounts for margin requirements as restricted cash. In addition, NiSource has amounts
deposited in trust to satisfy requirements for the provision of various property, liability,
workers compensation, and long-term disability insurance, which is classified as restricted cash
and disclosed as an investing cash flow on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.

Restricted cash was $286.6 million and $57.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
2007, respectively. The increase in restricted cash was due primarily to the change in forward gas
prices which resulted in increased margin deposits on open derivative contracts.

D. Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenue.

Accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets includes both billed and unbilled amounts as NiSource believes that total accounts
receivable is a more meaningful presentation, given the factors which impact both billed and
unbilled accounts receivable. Unbilled revenue is based on estimated amounts of electric energy or
natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its customers. Unbilled amounts of accounts receivable
relate to a portion of a customer’s consumption of gas or electricity from the date of the last
cycle billing date through the last day of the month (balance sheet date). Factors taken into
consideration when estimating unbilled revenue include historical usage, customer rates and
weather. Accounts receivable fluctuates from year to year depending upon seasonality and price
volatility. NiSource’s accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes unbilled revenue, less reserves, in the
amounts of $284.5 million and $229.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

E. Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.

NiSource’s investments in debt and equity securities
are carried at fair value and are designated as available-for-sale. These investments are included
within “Other investments” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, net of
deferred income taxes, are reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These
investments are monitored for other than temporary declines in market value. Realized gains and
losses and permanent impairments are reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Income. No
material impairment charges were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $41 million and $49 million, respectively, of
investments were pledged as collateral for trust accounts related to NiSource’s wholly-owned
insurance company.

F. Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.

NiSource’s rate-regulated subsidiaries
follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. SFAS No. 71 provides that
rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the
economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are
designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and it is probable that such rates
can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate
determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are
recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or
refunded to customers.

In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its
costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the
criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write-down of all or a portion of
NiSource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery
was approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally
accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during
such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable
amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required
to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In management’s opinion, NiSource’s regulated
subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future.

With the adoption of SFAS No. 158 NiSource determined that for certain rate-regulated subsidiaries
the future recovery of pension and other postretirement plans costs is probable in accordance with
the requirements of SFAS No. 71. These rate-regulated subsidiaries recorded amounts that would
otherwise have been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to a regulatory asset
account. Refer to Note 12, “Pension and Other



ITEM 8.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information. These amounts are adjusted annually as part of the year-end valuation of pension and
other post retirement plan assets and liabilities. As December 31, 2008, the SFAS No. 158
regulatory assets increased by $796.0 million primarily due to the 30.3% decrease of the value of
the pension assets during 2008.

Regulatory assets including underrecovered gas and fuel cost of approximately $1,966.9 million as
of December 31, 2008 are not presently included in rate base and consequently are not earning
a return on investment. Regulatory assets of approximately $1,729.7 million include expenses
that are recovered as components of the cost of service and are generally covered by
regulatory orders. These costs are recovered over a remaining life of up to 30 years.
Regulatory assets of approximately $237.2 million require specific rate action.

G. Utility Plant and Other Property and Related Depreciation and Maintenance.

Property, plant and
equipment (principally utility plant) are stated at cost. The rate-regulated subsidiaries record
depreciation using composite rates on a straight-line basis over the remaining service lives of the
electric, gas and common properties.

NiSource’s property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were classified as
follows:

Northern Indiana’s common utility plant and associated accumulated depreciation and
amortization are allocated
between Gas Distribution Utility and Electric Utility
Property, Plant and Equipment.

For rate-regulated companies, AFUDC is capitalized on all classes of property except organization
costs, land, autos, office equipment, tools and other general property purchases. The allowance is
applied to construction costs for that period of time between the date of the expenditure and the
date on which such project is completed and placed in service. The pre-tax rate for AFUDC was 3.3%
in 2008, 5.5% in 2007, and 5.5% in 2006. Short-term borrowings were primarily used to fund
construction efforts for all three years presented. The decrease in the 2008 AFUDC rate, as
compared with 2007, was due to a decrease in short-term interest rates.

The depreciation provisions for utility plant, as a percentage of the original cost, for the
periods ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were as follows:




Electric Operations

3.7

%

3.6

Generally, NiSource’s subsidiaries follow the practice of charging maintenance and repairs,
including the cost of removal of minor items of property, to expense as incurred. When regulated
property that represents a retired unit is



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

replaced or removed, the cost of such property is credited to utility plant, and such cost, net
of salvage, is charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation in accordance with
composite depreciation.

H. Carrying Charges and Deferred Depreciation.

Upon completion of units 17 and 18 at the R. M.
Schahfer Generating Station, Northern Indiana capitalized the carrying charges and deferred
depreciation in accordance with orders of the IURC, pending the inclusion of the cost of each unit
in rates. Such carrying charges and deferred depreciation are being amortized over the remaining
service life of each unit.

Northern Indiana has capitalized carrying charges and deferred depreciation and certain operating
expenses relating to its scrubber service agreement for its Bailly Generating Station in accordance
with an order of the IURC. The accumulated balance of the deferred costs and related carrying
charges is being amortized over the remaining life of the scrubber service agreement.

In 2005, the PUCO authorized Columbia of Ohio to revise its depreciation accrual rates for the
period beginning January 1, 2005. The revised depreciation rates are now higher than those which
would have been utilized if Columbia of Ohio were not subject to regulation. The amount of
depreciation that would have been recorded for 2005 through 2008 had Columbia of Ohio not been
subject to rate regulation is a combined $138.3 million, a $23.7 million decrease over the $162.0
million reflected in rates. The regulatory asset was $108.0 million and $113.9 million as of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The amount of depreciation that would have been recorded for 2008 had Columbia of Ohio not been
subject to rate regulation is $34.0 million, a $5.8 million decrease over the $39.8 million
reflected in rates.

I. Amortization of Software Costs.

External and internal costs associated with computer software
developed for internal use are capitalized. Capitalization of such costs commences upon the
completion of the preliminary stage of each project in accordance with SOP 98-1. Once the
installed software is ready for its intended use, such capitalized costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis generally over a period of five years. NiSource amortized $23.1 million in
2008, $22.0 million in 2007 and $20.1 million in 2006 related to software costs. NiSource
unamortized software balance was $92.1 million and $61.5 million
at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

J. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

NiSource has approximately $4.0 billion in goodwill and
other intangible assets. Substantially all goodwill relates to the excess of cost over the fair
value of the net assets acquired in the Columbia acquisition. In addition, NiSource has other
intangible assets consisting primarily of franchise rights apart from goodwill that were identified
as part of the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisition of Bay State, a
wholly-owned subsidiaries of NiSource, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over forty
years from the date of acquisition. NiSource accounts for goodwill in accordance with SFAS No.
142 and for other intangible assets under SFAS No. 144. Refer to Note 6, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

K. Long-lived Assets.

NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets contains significant long-lived
assets other than goodwill and intangible assets discussed above which are not subject to recovery
under SFAS No. 71. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of
these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be
impaired as per SFAS No. 144. Refer to Note 3, “Impairments and Other Charges,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

L. Revenue Recognition.

Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility
revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual
basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in
advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and
recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities.

M. Earnings Per Share.

Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders
by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The weighted
average shares outstanding for diluted EPS include the incremental effects of the various long-term
incentive compensation plans. There are no instruments that would result in an antidilutive effect
on the calculation of EPS.

N. Estimated Rate Refunds

. Certain rate-regulated subsidiaries collect revenues subject to
refund pending final determination in rate proceedings. In connection with such revenues,
estimated rate refund liabilities are recorded which reflect management’s current judgment of
the ultimate outcomes of the proceedings. No provisions are made when, in the opinion of
management, the facts and circumstances preclude a reasonable estimate of the outcome.

O. Accounts Receivable Sales Program.

NiSource enters into agreements with third parties to sell
certain accounts receivable without recourse. These sales are reflected as reductions of accounts
receivable in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and as operating cash flows in the
accompanying Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. The costs of these programs, which are based
upon the purchasers’ level of investment and borrowing costs, are charged to Other, net in the
accompanying Statements of Consolidated Income.

P. Fuel Adjustment Clause.

All metered electric rates contain a provision for adjustment to
reflect increases and decreases in the cost of fuel and the fuel cost of purchased power through
operation of a FAC. As prescribed by order of the IURC applicable to metered retail rates, the
adjustment factor has been calculated based on the estimated cost of fuel and the fuel cost of
purchased power in a future three-month period. If two statutory requirements relating to expense
and return levels are satisfied, any under-recovery or over-recovery caused by variances between
estimated and actual costs in a given three-month period are recorded as adjustments to revenue and
will be included in a future filing, provided that the purchase power benchmark has not been
exceeded. Northern Indiana records any under-recovery or over-recovery as a current regulatory
asset or liability until such time as it is billed or refunded to its customers. The fuel
adjustment factor is subject to a quarterly review by the IURC and remains in effect for a
three-month period.

Q. Gas Cost Adjustment Clause.

All of NiSource’s Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries defer
most differences between gas purchase costs and the recovery of such costs in revenues, and adjust
future billings for such deferrals on a basis consistent with applicable state-approved tariff
provisions.

R. Gas Inventory.

Both the LIFO inventory methodology and the weighted average methodology are
used to value natural gas in storage, as approved by state regulators for each of NiSource’s
regulated subsidiaries. Inventory valued using LIFO was $382.4 million and $344.3 million at
December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Based on the average cost of gas using the LIFO method,
the estimated replacement cost of gas in storage at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007,
exceeded the stated LIFO cost by $274.9 million and $481.0 million, respectively. Inventory valued
using the weighted average methodology was $129.4 million at December 31, 2008 and $113.9 million
at December 31, 2007.

S. Accounting for Exchange and Balancing Arrangements of Natural Gas.

NiSource’s Gas Transmission
and Storage and Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries enter into balancing and exchange
arrangements of natural gas as part of their operations and off-system sales programs. NiSource
records a receivable or payable for their respective cumulative gas imbalances and for any gas
borrowed or lent under an exchange agreement. These receivables and payables are recorded as
“Exchange gas receivable” or “Exchange gas payable” on NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, as
appropriate.

T. Accounting for Emissions Allowances.

Northern Indiana has obtained SO2 and NOx emissions
allowances from the EPA based upon its electric generation operations that the utility may sell,
trade or hold for future use. Northern Indiana utilizes the inventory model in accounting for
these emissions allowances, whereby these allowances were recognized at zero cost upon receipt from
the EPA. Proceeds received from the annual EPA auction of allowances and through the utilization
of allowances in the generation of power for off-system sales are deferred as regulatory
liabilities. The sale of other allowances, not used due to investments made by NiSource in
pollution control assets and services, are reflected in earnings in the period in which they occur
and are included in net cash flows from operating activities in NiSource’s Statements of
Consolidated Cash Flows.

U. Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities.

SFAS No. 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging
activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, unless such contracts are exempted as
a normal purchase normal sale under the provisions of the standard. The accounting for changes in
the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting
designation.

NiSource uses a variety of derivative instruments (exchange traded futures and options, physical
forwards and options, financial commodity swaps, and interest rate swaps) to effectively manage its
commodity price risk and interest rate risk exposure. If certain conditions are met, a derivative
may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a
recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to
variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. In order for a derivative contract to be
designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or
transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the
hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated.
Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recognized currently in earnings. For derivative
contracts that qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exemption under SFAS. No. 133, a
contract’s fair value is not recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements until the contract
is settled.

Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss), regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the
nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the
effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. If a
forecasted transaction corresponding to a cash flow hedge is no longer probable to occur, the
accumulated gains or losses on the derivative are recognized currently in earnings. For fair value
hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair
value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate-making process, the rate-regulated subsidiaries
generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or
losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains
and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues
through rates. When gains and losses are recognized in earnings, they are recognized in cost of
sales for derivatives that correspond to commodity risk activities and are recognized in interest
expense for derivatives that correspond to interest-rate risk activities.

V. Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits.

NiSource records income taxes to recognize full
interperiod tax allocations. Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are provided for
the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to
future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of
existing assets and liabilities. Previously recorded investment tax credits of the regulated
subsidiaries were deferred on the balance sheet and are being amortized to book income over the
regulatory life of the related properties to conform to regulatory policy.

To the extent certain deferred income taxes of the regulated companies are recoverable or payable
through future rates, regulatory assets and liabilities have been established. Regulatory assets
for income taxes are primarily attributable to property related tax timing differences for which
deferred taxes had not been provided in the past, when regulators did not recognize such taxes as
costs in the rate-making process. Regulatory liabilities for income taxes are primarily
attributable to the regulated companies’ obligation to refund to ratepayers deferred income taxes
provided at rates higher than the current federal income tax rate. Such amounts are credited to
ratepayers using either the average rate assumption method or the reverse South Georgia method.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Ni

Source Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code and relevant state taxing authorities, NiSource and its
subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns for federal and certain state jurisdictions.
NiSource and its subsidiaries are parties to an agreement (Tax Allocation Agreement) that provides
for the allocation of consolidated tax liabilities. The Tax Allocation Agreement generally
provides that each party is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be owed had the
party been separately subject to tax. Any net benefit attributable to the parent is reallocated to
other members.

W. Environmental Expenditures.

NiSource accrues for costs associated with environmental
remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs is probable and the amounts can be
reasonably estimated, regardless of when the expenditures are actually made. The undiscounted
estimated future expenditures are based on currently enacted laws and regulations, existing
technology and estimated site-specific costs where assumptions may be made about the nature and
extent of site contamination, the extent of cleanup efforts, costs of alternative cleanup methods
and other variables. The liability is adjusted as further information is discovered or
circumstances change. The reserves for estimated environmental expenditures are recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets in “Other accruals” for short-term portions of these liabilities and
“Other noncurrent liabilities” for the respective long-term portions of these liabilities.
Rate-regulated subsidiaries applying SFAS No. 71 establish regulatory assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets to the extent that future recovery of environmental remediation costs is probable
through the regulatory process.

In addition, Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC in 2003 to recover costs associated
with environmental compliance programs for NOx pollution-reduction equipment at Northern Indiana’s
generating stations. Refer to Note 8, “Regulatory Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information.

X. Excise Taxes.

NiSource accounts for excise taxes that are customer liabilities by separately
stating on its invoices the tax to its customers and recording amounts invoiced as liabilities
payable to the applicable taxing jurisdiction. NiSource accounts for these taxes in accordance
with EITF No. 06-3 whereby these types of taxes, comprised largely of sales taxes collected, are
presented on a net basis affecting neither revenues nor cost of sales. NiSource accounts for other
taxes for which it is liable by recording a liability for the expected tax with a corresponding
charge to “Other taxes” expense.

2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS
No. 157 — Fair Value Measurements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 to define
fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and to expand disclosures about fair
value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not change the requirements to apply fair value in existing
accounting standards.

Under SFAS No. 157, fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in
which the reporting entity transacts. The standard clarifies that fair value should be based on
the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.

To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, SFAS No. 157 establishes a
fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value
into three levels. The level in the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of the fair value
hierarchy defined by SFAS No. 157 are as follows:

•

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical asset or
liabilities that the company has the ability to access as of the reporting date.

•

Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through corroboration
with observable market data.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Ni

Source Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

•

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs, such as internally developed pricing models for
the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset or liability.

SFAS No. 157 became effective for NiSource as of January 1, 2008. The provisions of SFAS No. 157
are to be applied prospectively, except for the initial impact on the following three items, which
are required to be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the
year of adoption: (1) changes in fair value measurements of existing derivative financial
instruments measured initially using the transaction price under EITF Issue No. 02-3, (2) existing
hybrid financial instruments measured initially at fair value using the transaction price and (3)
blockage factor discounts. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have an impact on NiSource’s
January 1, 2008 balance of retained earnings and is not anticipated to have a material impact
prospectively.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-2, which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157
for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of non-financial assets and liabilities until fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2008. NiSource has elected to defer the adoption of the
nonrecurring fair value measurement disclosures of non-financial assets and liabilities.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-3, which clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 in
a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining
the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. The
FSP was effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which financial statements have not
been issued.

Refer to Note 18, “Fair Value Disclosures,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding the adoption of SFAS No. 157.

SFAS No. 158 — Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158 to improve existing reporting for defined benefit
postretirement plans by requiring employers to recognize in the statement of financial position the
overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan, among other changes. In
the fourth quarter of 2006, NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158

On January 1, 2007, NiSource adopted the SFAS No. 158 measurement date provisions requiring
employers to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the fiscal year-end. The pre-tax
impact of adopting the SFAS No. 158 measurement date provisions increased deferred charges and
other assets by $9.4 million, decreased regulatory assets by $89.6 million, decreased retained
earnings by $11.3 million, increased accumulated other comprehensive income by $5.3 million and
decreased accrued liabilities for postretirement and postemployment benefits by $74.2 million.
NiSource also recorded a reduction in deferred income taxes of approximately $2.6 million. In
addition, 2007 expense for pension and postretirement benefits reflects the updated measurement
date valuations. Refer to Note 12, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

SFAS No. 159 — The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 which permits
entities to choose to measure certain financial instruments at fair value that are not currently
required to be measured at fair value. Upon adoption, a cumulative adjustment would be made to
beginning retained earnings for the initial fair value option remeasurement. Subsequent unrealized
gains and losses for fair value option items will be reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and should not be applied
retrospectively, except as permitted for certain conditions for early adoption. NiSource has
chosen not to elect to measure any applicable financial assets or liabilities at fair value
pursuant to this standard when SFAS No. 159 was adopted on January 1, 2008.

FIN 48 — Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48 to
reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement
requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, this interpretation requires
that a tax position meet a “more-likely-than-not recognition threshold” for the benefit of an
uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Ni

Source Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

and requires that benefit to be measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50%
likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The determination of whether a tax position
meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is based on whether it is probable of being
sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of
the position. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006.

On January 1, 2007, NiSource adopted the provisions of FIN 48. As a result of the implementation
of FIN 48, NiSource recognized a charge of $0.8 million to the opening balance of retained
earnings. Refer to Note 11, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.

FSP FIN 39-1 — FASB Staff Position Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39.

In April 2007, the
FASB issued FSP FIN 39-1 to amend paragraph 3 of FIN 39 to replace the terms

conditional contracts

and

exchange contracts

with the term

derivative instruments

as defined in SFAS No. 133. This FSP
also amends paragraph 10 of FIN 39 to permit a reporting entity to offset fair value amounts
recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral
against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same
counterparty under a master netting arrangement. This FSP became effective for NiSource as of
January 1, 2008. NiSource has not elected to net fair value amounts for its derivative instruments
or the fair value amounts recognized for its right to receive cash collateral or obligation to pay
cash collateral arising from those derivative instruments recognized at fair value, which are
executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. This is consistent with
NiSource’s current accounting policy prior to the adoption of this amended standard. NiSource
discloses amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral within “Restricted cash” and
amounts recognized for the right to return cash collateral within current liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8- FASB Staff Position Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 and FASB
Interpretation No. 46(R).

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 to
require public entities to provide additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets and
to provide additional disclosures related to an entities involvement with variable interest
entities. This FSP is effective for the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2008,
with early application encouraged. Refer to Note 10, “Variable Interest Entities and Equity
Investments,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS No. 141R — Business Combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R to improve
the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of information that a reporting
entity provides in its financial reports regarding business combinations and its effects, including
recognition of assets and liabilities, the measurement of goodwill and required disclosures. This
Statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
on or after December 15, 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited. NiSource is currently reviewing
the provisions of SFAS No. 141R to determine the impact on future business combinations.

SFAS No. 160 — Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment of ARB
No. 51.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 to improve the relevance, comparability,
and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated
financial statements regarding non-controlling ownership interests in a business and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This Statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and earlier adoption is
prohibited. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of SFAS No. 160 to determine the impact
it may have on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

SFAS No. 161 — Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging — an amendment of SFAS No. 133.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161 to amend and expand the disclosure requirements of
SFAS No. 133 with the intent to provide users of the financial statement with an enhanced
understanding of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how these derivatives are
accounted for and how the respective reporting entity’s financial statements are affected. SFAS
No. 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, and
earlier application is encouraged. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of SFAS

FSP FAS 132(R)-1 — FASB Staff Position Amendment of FASB Statement No. 132(R)-1.

In December 2008,
the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1 to amend SFAS No. 132(R) to provide guidance on an employer’s
disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. FSP FAS
132(R)-1 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009 with earlier
adoption permitted. NiSource is currently reviewing the additional disclosure requirements to
determine the impact on the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

3. Impairments and Other Charges

Impairments.

Under the provisions of SFAS No. 144, an impairment loss shall be recognized only if
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The test
compares the carrying amount of the long lived asset to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.

For 2008, NiSource recognized $3.4 million in expense for the impairment of the Marble Cliff
facility discussed in Note 4, “Discontinued Operation and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale.”
For 2007, NiSource recognized $11.0 million in expense for the impairment of assets, including a
$7.2 million impairment charge related to base gas at a storage field. For the 2006 year, $4.7
million was recognized for the impairment of certain investments.

Other Charges.

NiSource incurred additional costs related to its Amended Outsourcing Agreement with
IBM. These costs fall into three categories; a one-time financial settlement charge, transition
costs to transfer certain functional areas to NiSource, and capital costs for completion of
information technology related transformation projects. A settlement charge of $9.8 million was
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007 to Operation and Maintenance expense on the Statement of
Consolidated Income.

Assets classified as discontinued operations or held for sale are no longer depreciated.

On June 30, 2008, NiSource sold Whiting Clean Energy to BPAE for $216.7 million, which included
$16.1 million in working capital. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the
operations of Whiting Clean Energy as discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31,
2008, an after tax loss of $32.3 million was included in Gain (Loss) on Disposition of Discontinued
Operations in the Statements of Consolidated Income. As such, a net loss of $2.4 million, net
income of $3.7 million and net loss of $25.7 million is included as net income or loss from
discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

On December 1, 2008, NiSource sold NiSource subsidiaries Northern Utilities and Granite State to
Unitil Corporation for $201.6 million which included $41.6 million in working capital. The working
capital amount will be adjusted based upon the final settlement during the first quarter of 2009.
Under the terms of the transaction, Unitil Corporation acquired Northern Utilities, a local gas
distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire and
Granite State Gas, an 86-mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine
and New Hampshire. For the year ended December 31, 2008, an after tax loss of $75.8 million was
included in Gain (Loss) on Disposition of Discontinued Operations in the Statements of Consolidated
Income. Net income of $6.8 million, $5.3 million, and $5.3 million is included as net income or
loss from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

On June 27, 2008, Columbia Gulf sold a portion of Columbia Gulf’s offshore assets to Tennessee Gas
Pipeline Company for $7.5 million, which was received on July 1, 2008. During the fourth quarter
2008, catastrophic losses sustained in prior years were settled with various insurance companies,
resulting in the recognition of a loss on sale of assets of $11.0 million. Including the insurance
settlement, the sale resulted in a loss of $8.3 million for 2008.

NDC Douglas Properties, a subsidiary of NiSource Development Company, is in the process of exiting
some of its low income housing investments. One of these investments was disposed of during 2007
and two other investments

are expected to be sold or disposed of during 2009. NiSource has
accounted for the assets and liabilities of the investments to be sold as assets held for sale.

NiSource Corporate Services is continuing to work with several potential buyers to sell its Marble
Cliff facility. A third party appraisal was performed in December 2008 with an estimated market
value of the property of $6.2 million. An impairment loss of $1.8 million was recorded during the
fourth quarter of 2008 related to the appraisal. In late February 2008 an offer was accepted but
the parties have failed to reach a definitive agreement. As a result of the initial offer, an
impairment loss of $1.6 million was recognized during the first quarter of 2008. During the first
quarter of 2007 an impairment loss of $3.2 million was recognized due to the current book value
exceeding the estimated fair value of the facility. NiSource has accounted for this facility as
assets held for sale.

Lake Erie Land, which is wholly-owned by NiSource, is in the process of selling real estate over a
10-year period as a part of an agreement reached in June 2006 with a private real estate
development group. Part of the sale transaction included the assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club,
and NiSource began accounting for the operations of the Sand Creek Golf Club as discontinued
operations at that time. NiSource estimates the property to be sold to the private developer
during the next twelve months and accounts for these assets as assets held for sale.

Columbia Transmission is in the process of selling certain facilities that are non-core to the
operation of the pipeline system. During the third quarter of 2008, certain assets were
reclassified to assets held and used, which resulted in a $1.6 million decrease to the balance of
assets held for sale. In the first quarter of 2008, certain assets in Ohio were sold, which
resulted in a $3.8 million decrease to the balance of assets held for sale.

During the second quarter of 2008 Bay State signed a letter of intent to sell certain assets.
Beginning in the second quarter of 2008, these assets were accounted for as assets held for sale.

NiSource Retail Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NiSource, is engaged in a process to sell
certain assets. These assets and liabilities of NiSource Retail Services were accounted for as
assets of discontinued operations and the results of operations and cash flows of NiSource Retail
Services were classified as discontinued operations during the third quarter of 2008.

Results from discontinued operations from Whiting Clean Energy, Granite State Gas, Northern

5. Purchase of Sugar Creek Plant

On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for $329.7 million. This purchase was in
response to Northern Indiana’s need to add approximately 1,000 mw of new capacity. Refer to Note
8, “Regulatory Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
The Sugar Creek facility is a CCGT located in West Terre Haute, Indiana with a plant capacity
rating of 535 mw. Sugar Creek has transmission access to both the MISO and PJM Interconnection
wholesale electricity markets. As of December 1, 2008, the Sugar Creek facility was dispatched
into MISO. At acquisition, Northern Indiana recorded at fair value $328.1 million related to
utility plant. No goodwill was recorded in conjunction with the purchase. The allocation of the
purchase price was assigned to the assets and liabilities of Sugar Creek, based on their estimated
fair value in accordance with GAAP.

6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

NiSource’s goodwill assets at December 31, 2008 pertaining to the acquisition of Columbia on
November 1, 2000, were $3,658.5 million. The goodwill balances at December 31, 2008 for Northern
Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas were $13.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively.

In the quarters ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007, NiSource performed its annual impairment
test of goodwill associated with the purchases of Columbia, Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and
Kokomo Gas. SFAS No. 142 requires that the impairment test be performed through the application of
a two-step fair value test. The first step of the test compares the fair values of the reporting
units with the carrying amounts, including goodwill. An impairment of goodwill results when there
is an excess of book value over the fair value of a reporting unit. The second step would then need
to be performed to quantify the impairment charge, if any, which would be measured by comparing the
implied value of goodwill to its carrying amount. The implied fair value of goodwill for each
reporting unit is determined by assigning the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets
and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.
Any excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts allocated to the assets and
liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

The results of the June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007 annual impairment tests indicated that no
impairment charge was required. For the purpose of testing for impairment of the goodwill recorded
in the acquisition of Columbia, the related subsidiaries were aggregated into two distinct
reporting units, one within the Gas Distribution Operations segment and one within the Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas are
each separate reporting units within the Gas Distribution Operations segment.

NiSource uses an income approach to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for the purposes
of this test. The method is generally based on a discounted cash flow valuation model that
incorporates internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating results to estimate a
fair value of each reporting unit. Determining fair value requires management to make a number of
judgments about assumptions and estimates used in the model that are subjective and include
unobservable inputs or assumptions. The use of alternate judgments and/or assumptions could have a
material impact on the financial statements.

Certain key assumptions include the five-year plan operating results, discount rates and the
long-term outlook for growth rates, among other items. The discount rate used, based on the
weighted average cost of capital was 6.76% in the June 30, 2008 annual impairment test, which was a
decrease from the prior year’s rate of 7.3%, due primarily to a decrease in the risk-free rate and
market risk premium. Operating income growth rates were 3.93% for the Columbia distribution
reporting unit and 3.49% for the Columbia transmission reporting unit in the 2008 test, which were
comparable to the growth rates used in the prior year.

NiSource continually monitors potential indicators of impairment to determine if any triggering
events are present that would require an impairment test more frequently than the annual test.

As of December 31, 2008, NiSource’s market capitalization was approximately $3.0 billion, while
NiSource’s net assets, inclusive of goodwill, were $4.7 billion. NiSource’s market capitalization
at June 30, 2008 of approximately $4.9 billion was above NiSource’s net asset value when the annual
impairment test was performed. In accordance with paragraph 28 of SFAS No. 142, NiSource
considered whether there were any events or changes in



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Ni

Source Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

circumstances during the second half of 2008 that would more likely than not reduce the fair value
of any of the reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate another goodwill
impairment test and concluded that there were none. NiSource attributes the decline in its market
capitalization primarily to the overall stock market decline resulting from the credit crisis
taking place in the United States and globally, and not any fundamental change in NiSource’s
regulated gas distribution and gas transmission and storage businesses that comprise the reporting
units for which goodwill is attributable. NiSource’s stock price decline of 41.9% from December
31, 2007 compares to the overall declines of the S&P Utilities Average and Dow Jones Industrial
Average, of 31.5% and 33.8% respectively, over the same twelve-month time period. The following
events likely contributed to a greater decline in NiSource’s stock price during the fourth quarter
ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the overall market and industry performance during the same
period, but these events had no impact on the goodwill bearing reporting units. On October 24,
2008, a West Virginia Circuit Court approved a $380 million settlement for Tawney (a legal
settlement related to discontinued operation entity, CNR, which was sold in 2003.) NiSource’s
share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. This settlement as well as difficult
credit markets likely contributed to Standard and Poor’s changing the outlook for NiSource to
negative. All rating agencies have classified NiSource as investment grade. In addition, the
Northern Indiana electric rate case was filed on June 27, 2008 and the initial hearings began in
January 2009. This is the first electric rate case in 20 years and is causing further uncertainty
in the market place that may be depressing NiSource’s stock price. The entity involved in this
rate case does not carry goodwill.

Given the lack of a fundamental change in the underlying businesses that carry goodwill and their
various assets, NiSource does not believe the decline in its stock price and the underlying reasons
for that decline are indicative of an actual decline in the company’s fair value of the underlying
assets.

NiSource’s reportable entities with goodwill consist of regulated companies. Regulated recovery
rates and approved rate of returns allow for more predictable and steady streams of revenues and
cash flows which help mitigate the impacts that might otherwise be felt from the recessionary
trends seen in other industries and also adds more reliability to the cash flow forecasts used to
calculate fair value. NiSource reviewed its estimates and assumptions used in the discounted cash
flow model at June 30, 2008, noting that there are no significant changes that would be made in
light of the changing economic circumstances during the last half of the year. In addition, the
2008 operating results for the Gas Distribution Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations segments exceeded and were in line, respectively, with 2008 estimates used to calculate
fair value in the June 30, 2008 annual impairment test. Favorable rate case outcomes within Gas
Distribution Operations and growth projects and increased firm capacity reservation fees within Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations contributed to the favorable results.

It should also be noted that NiSource has demonstrated the ability to obtain credit as evidenced by
a new short-term credit facility of $500 million that was obtained on September 23, 2008, Northern
Indiana’s re-issuance of the Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds for $254 million on August 25,
2008 with a weighted average interest rate now fixed at 5.58%, and the renewal of Northern
Indiana’s $200 million accounts receivable facility in December 2008. In addition, during February
2009 NiSource negotiated a two-year term loan facility with a syndicate of banks maturing in
February 2011. Borrowings under the facility will have an effective cost of LIBOR plus 538 basis
points. The initial closing of the facility occurred on February 13, 2009, with a subsequent
closing expected to take place in early April under an “accordion” feature under which the facility
can be expanded to $500 million prior to the final closing. NiSource has received bank commitments
totaling $265 million.

NiSource’s intangible assets, apart from goodwill, consist of franchise rights, which were
identified as part of the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisition in February of
1999 of Bay State. These amounts were $330.6 million and $341.6 million, net of amortization of
$111.6 million and $100.6 million, at December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively, and are being
amortized over forty years from the date of acquisition. NiSource recorded amortization expense of
$11.0 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006 related to its intangible assets.

7. Asset Retirement Obligations

NiSource has accounted for retirement obligations on its assets since January 1, 2003 with the
adoption of SFAS No. 143. In the fourth quarter 2005, NiSource adopted the provisions of FIN 47,
which broadened the scope of SFAS



ITEM 8.

Ni

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

No. 143 to include contingent asset retirement obligations and it also provided additional guidance
for the measurement of the asset retirement liabilities. This accounting standard and the related
interpretation require entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the
entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived
asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the
useful life of the related asset. The rate-regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the
amount recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected in rates as required
pursuant to SFAS No. 71 for those amounts it has collected in rates or expects to collect in future
rates.

Changes in NiSource’s liability for asset retirement obligations for the years 2008 and 2007 are

NiSource has recognized asset retirement obligations associated with various obligations including
costs to remove and dispose of certain construction materials located within many of NiSource’s
facilities, certain costs to retire pipeline, removal costs for certain underground storage tanks,
removal of certain pipelines known to contain PCB contamination, closure costs for certain sites
including ash ponds, solid waste management units and a landfill, obligations to return leased rail
cars to specified conditions and the removal costs of certain, as well as some other nominal asset
retirement obligations. NiSource recognizes that there are obligations to incur significant costs
to retire wells associated with gas storage operations; however, these assets are land assets with
indeterminable lives. Additionally, NiSource has a significant obligation associated with the
decommissioning of its two hydro facilities located in Indiana. These hydro facilities also have
an indeterminate life, and no asset retirement obligation has been recorded.

Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and
collected in the service rates of the rate-regulated subsidiaries are classified as regulatory
liabilities and other removal costs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Northern Indiana performed retirement activities associated with a landfill and asbestos removal
resulting in settlements of $5.4 million for 2008. Gas Distributions Operations annual cut and cap
additions and settlements for its pipe system for 2008 were $1.7 million and $4.3 million,
respectively.

8. Regulatory Matters

Gas Distribution Operations Regulatory Matters

Significant Rate Developments.

Columbia of Ohio filed a base rate case with the PUCO on March 3,
2008, and a settlement agreement was filed on October 24, 2008. In the base rate case, Columbia of
Ohio sought recovery of increased infrastructure rehabilitation costs, as well as the stabilization
of revenues and cost recovery through rate design. The agreement included an annual revenue
increase of $47.1 million, and also provides for recovery of costs associated with Columbia of
Ohio’s infrastructure rehabilitation program. On December 3, 2008, the PUCO approved the
settlement agreement in all material respects, and approved Columbia of Ohio’s proposed rate
design. On January 2, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed a notice of its intent to adjust its
Infrastructure Replacement Program Rider, pursuant to the rate order, indicating that an
application to adjust the rider would be filed by February 27, 2009.

On January 15, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO requesting authority to
increase Columbia of Ohio’s PIPP rider rate. The application proposes to increase the PIPP rider
rate in order to collect $82.2 million in PIPP arrearages.

On January 28, 2008, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the PPUC, and on July
2, 2008, Columbia of Pennsylvania and all interested parties filed a unanimous settlement. In
the base rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania sought to recover costs associated with its
significant infrastructure rehabilitation program, as well as stabilize revenues and cost
recovery through modifications to rate design. On October 23, 2008, the PPUC issued an Order
approving the settlement as filed, increasing annual revenues by $41.5 million. Included in
the annual revenue increase is consideration for costs associated with Columbia of
Pennsylvania’s infrastructure rehabilitation program.

On October 17, 2007, Bay State petitioned the DPU to allow the company to collect an additional
$7.5 million in annual revenue related to usage reductions occurring since its last rate case. Bay
State also requested approval of a steel infrastructure tracker that would allow for recovery of
ongoing infrastructure replacement program investments. The DPU held hearings on this matter in
the first quarter of 2008 and issued an order denying Bay State’s petition on April 30, 2008.
NiSource has decided not to appeal this case, and continues to weigh its options. On July 16,
2008, the DPU issued an order in its generic decoupling proceeding for gas utilities. NiSource has
reviewed the generic order, and considers the DPU’s action favorable.

On October 1, 2008, Columbia of Maryland filed a base rate case with the Maryland Public Service
Commission, and on February 20, 2009, Columbia of Maryland and all interested parties filed a
unanimous settlement in the case, recommending an annual revenue increase of $1.2 million. In
its initial filing, Columbia of Maryland sought an increase of $3.7 million annually.
Columbia of Maryland anticipates approval of the settlement and implementation of new rates in
the second quarter of 2009.

Cost Recovery and Trackers.

A significant portion of the distribution companies’ revenue is
related to the recovery of gas costs, the review and recovery of which occurs via standard
regulatory proceedings. All states require periodic review of actual gas procurement activity to
determine prudence and to permit the recovery of prudently incurred costs related to the supply of
gas for customers. NiSource distribution companies have historically been found prudent in the
procurement of gas supplies to serve customers.

Certain operating costs of the NiSource distribution companies are significant, recurring in
nature, and generally outside the control of the distribution companies. Some states allow the
recovery of such costs via cost tracking mechanisms. Such tracking mechanisms allow for
abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the distribution companies to implement charges and
recover appropriate costs. Tracking mechanisms allow for more timely recovery of such costs as
compared with more traditional cost recovery mechanisms. Examples of such mechanisms include gas
cost recovery adjustment mechanisms, tax riders, and bad debt recovery mechanisms.

Comparability of Gas Distribution Operations line item operating results is impacted by these
regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt
expenses. Increases in the expenses that are the subject of trackers result in a corresponding
increase in net revenues and therefore have essentially no impact on total operating income
results.

On April 9, 2008, the PUCO issued an order approving, in all material respects, a joint stipulation
submitted on behalf of Columbia of Ohio. This stipulation is a result of a process that began on
April 13, 2005 with a PUCO ordered investigation into the type of gas risers installed in the
state, the conditions of installation and overall performance. The stipulation provides for:
establishment of accounting for and recovery of costs resulting from the Staff’s investigation;
Columbia of Ohio’s performance of a survey to identify those customer-owned risers on its system
prone to failure; and related customer education and other program related expenses. In addition
this stipulation provides for: Columbia of Ohio’s assumption of financial responsibility for the
replacement of all risers identified as prone to failure; repair or replacement of hazardous
customer owned service lines; and capitalization of this investment with recovery to be addressed
in future rate proceedings. As of December 31, 2008, Columbia of Ohio has approximately $50.6
million in costs associated with the gas riser and customer service line programs recorded as a
regulatory asset and/or capitalized plant.

On December 28, 2007, Columbia of Ohio entered into a stipulation with the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel
and PUCO Staff and other stakeholders resolving litigation concerning a pending Gas Cost Recovery
audit of Columbia of Ohio. The stipulation calls for an accelerated pass back to customers of
$36.6 million, that will occur from January 31, 2008 through January 31, 2009, generated through
off-system sales and capacity release programs, the development of new energy efficiency programs
for introduction in 2009, and the development of a wholesale auction process for customer supply to
take effect in 2010. Approximately $30.2 million was passed back through December 31, 2008. The
stipulation also resolves issues related to pending and future Gas Cost Recovery Management
Performance audits through 2008. The PUCO approved this agreement on January 23, 2008.

Columbia of Ohio and other stakeholders reached an agreement in the fourth quarter of 2007 that
establishes the framework for operations under Columbia of Ohio’s CHOICE

®

program for
the next several years and provides for a wholesale gas supply auction by early 2010. On January
23, 2008 the PUCO approved the agreement. The stipulation also included a commitment, on behalf of
Columbia of Ohio, to file on or before February 1, 2009 an application that proposes to implement
by no later than April 1, 2010 a wholesale auction procedure to secure the gas supply required to
serve its sales customers. Columbia of Ohio filed this application on January 30, 2009. Pursuant
to that application, Columbia of Ohio proposes to implement two consecutive one year long SSO
periods, starting in April 2010 with the intent to obtain commodity supplies for both Columbia of
Ohio’s PIPP and the SSO load. Columbia of Ohio will obtain gas supplies from alternative suppliers
and pass the price of that gas on to its sales customers at a monthly rate called the SSO rate.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations Regulatory Matters

Significant FERC Developments.

On November 6, 2008, the FERC issued an order approving a
stipulation and Consent Agreement entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf
(collectively the Columbia Pipelines) with the FERC’s Office of Enforcement. The Settlement
resolves any and all matters related to: (a) a preliminary, non-public investigation commenced on
January 25, 2005 into the Columbia Pipelines’ provision of the PAL Investigation; and (b) an
outstanding audit by the FERC’s Office of Market Oversight and Investigations, the predecessor of
FERC’s Office of Enforcement, commenced on September 30, 2003 in Docket No. PA03-16, and a
subsequent preliminary, non-public investigation, related to the audit. The Columbia Pipelines
cooperated with the FERC’s investigations.

To resolve the Docket No. PA03-16 audit the settlement provided for the Columbia Pipelines to pay a
civil penalty of $1.0 million to the United States Treasury. To resolve the PAL Investigation,
Columbia Transmission disgorged profits in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the amount of $9.0 million
to firm and interruptible gas transportation customers and to make several non-public compliance
reports. The Columbia Pipelines neither admitted nor denied the FERC’s Office of Enforcement’s
allegations.

Eastern Market Expansion Project.

On January 14, 2008, the FERC issued an order which granted a
certificate to construct the project. The project allows Columbia Transmission to expand its
facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain
existing facilities. This Eastern Market Expansion is projected to add 97,000 Dth per day of
storage and transportation deliverability and is fully subscribed on a 15-year contracted firm
basis. Construction of the facilities is underway and the project is expected to be in service by
April 2009.

Appalachian Expansion Project.

On August 22, 2008, the FERC issued an order to Columbia
Transmission, which granted a certificate to construct the project. The project specifies building
a new 9,470 hp compressor station in West Virginia. The Appalachian Expansion Project will add
100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity and is fully subscribed on a 15-year contracted firm
basis. Construction is in progress and the project is expected to be in service by the second half
of 2009.

Electric Operations Regulatory Matters

Significant Rate Developments.

Northern Indiana filed a petition for new electric base rates and
charges on June 27, 2008 and filed its case-in-chief on August 29, 2008. The filing requested a
two-step increase. The first step request was for an increase of approximately $24 million. The
second step was for an additional increase of approximately $81 million to incorporate the return
on and recovery of the Sugar Creek facility. Such increase was expected to become effective at the
date of dispatch of Sugar Creek by MISO. On December 1, 2008, Northern

Indiana successfully dispatched Sugar Creek into MISO, simultaneous with the termination of its PJM
commitment. As a result, a revised case-in-chief was filed on December 19, 2008, incorporating
Sugar Creek and resulting in a traditional one-step case, requesting an increase in base rates
calculated to produce additional gross margin of $85.7 million annually. Evidentiary hearings on
Northern Indiana’s direct case commenced on January 12, 2009 and concluded on February 6, 2009.
Several stakeholder groups have intervened in the case, representing customer groups and various
counties and towns within Northern Indiana’s electric service territory. A field hearing allowing
customers to individually participate will occur on March 3, 2009. The OUCC and intervenors are
scheduled to file their cases-in-chief by April 17, 2009. Northern Indiana is scheduled to file
its rebuttal testimony in June 2009, and final hearings are planned to begin July 27, 2009. If a
settlement agreement is not reached, and the full procedural schedule takes place, it is
anticipated that new rates would take effect in early 2010.

Northern Indiana is seeking to offer DSM and energy efficiency programs to its electric customers
and, accordingly, in December 2008 filed a case-in-chief requesting approval to implement a variety
of DSM programs. Proposed programs include rebates for energy efficiency appliances and an
air-conditioning cycling program, designed to reduce peak load. The IURC is also reviewing a
program that would allow customers to reduce their cost of electricity by agreeing to interrupt
their service under some yet to be defined guidelines that would match rules established by MISO.

In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In the electric
base rate case discussed above, Northern Indiana provided testimony that it intends to retire the
Mitchell station, demolish it, and remediate the site to industrial condition, subject to the
ability to recover these costs.

During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate
review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement.
The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will
receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year. The credits will continue at
approximately the same annual level and per the same methodology, until the IURC enters a base rate
order that approves revised Northern Indiana electric rates. The order included a rate moratorium
that expired on July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a
specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated
based on electric usage; therefore, in times of high usage the credit may be more than $55.1
million. Credits amounting to $53.9 million, $56.0 million and $50.9 million were recognized for
electric customers for the years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

MISO.

As part of Northern Indiana’s participation in the MISO transmission service and wholesale
energy market, certain administrative fees and non-fuel costs have been incurred. IURC orders have
been issued authorizing the deferral for consideration in a future rate case proceeding of the
administrative fees and certain non-fuel related costs incurred after Northern Indiana’s rate
moratorium, which expired on July 31, 2006. During 2008 non-fuel costs of $2.3 million were
deferred in accordance with the aforementioned orders. In addition, administrative, FERC and other
fees of $6.6 million were deferred. In total, for 2008 and 2007, MISO costs of $8.9 million and
$9.9 million, respectively, were deferred. In the base rate case filed in August 2008, Northern
Indiana proposed recovery over a three year amortization period of the cumulative amount of charges
that will have been deferred by the time a rate order is issued, and a tracker for recovery of
these charges on an ongoing basis.

In its electric base rate case filed in August 2008 and also in the December 19, 2008 revised
filing, Northern Indiana proposed a new tracker, referred to as the Reliability Adjustment
mechanism. The case proposes that this tracker be used for recovery of MISO charges currently
being deferred. This tracker is also intended to be used to recover purchased power energy and
capacity costs and to share with ratepayers the proceeds of any off-system sales and transmission
revenues.

On April 25, 2006, the FERC issued an order on the MISO’s Transmission and Energy Markets Tariff,
stating that MISO had violated the tariff on several issues including not assessing revenue
sufficiency guarantee charges on virtual bids and offers and for charging revenue sufficiency
guarantee charges on imports. The FERC ordered MISO to perform a resettlement of these charges
back to the start of the Day 2 Market. The resettlement began in July 2007 and ended in January
2008. Certain charge types included in the resettlement were originally considered to be non-fuel
and were recorded as regulatory assets, in accordance with previous IURC orders allowing deferral
of certain non-fuel MISO costs. During the fourth quarter 2007, based on precedent set by an IURC
ruling for another

Indiana utility, Northern Indiana reclassified these charges, totaling $16.7 million, as fuel and
included them in the fuel cost recovery mechanism in its latest FAC filing. Prior to the hearing
for FAC-78 on April 17, 2008, several intervenors objected to a portion of the $16.7 million and
Northern Indiana agreed to remove $7.6 million from the FAC filing. This amount represents the
portion of the resettlement costs related to periods prior to December 9, 2005. The $7.6 million
was recorded as a reduction to net revenues in the first quarter of 2008.

On November 7, 2008, the FERC issued an order regarding the clarification of a rate mismatch as it
pertains to the RSG First Pass calculation. On November 10, 2008, the FERC issued an order
indicating that the RSG rates in effect were unjust and unreasonable based on a Section 206 filing
that Northern Indiana and Ameren jointly filed on August, 10, 2007. MISO determined that
resettlements are required for all periods from market start to the Section 206 Refund effective
date to remedy the rate mismatch. The FERC ordered refunds with interest after August 10, 2007.
MISO, in its compliance filing, indicated it will perform another resettlement to recalculate the
RSG First Pass Distribution Rate. These resettlements will begin in the first quarter of 2009 and
will conclude by the first quarter of 2010. As the result of these resettlements, Northern Indiana
will see a shift from RSG Second Pass, which is a non fuel charge, as determined from a previous
IURC order, to the RSG First Pass Distribution, which is included as part of the fuel cost
mechanism. The interim RSG allocation is still subject to rehearing. Northern Indiana does not
expect a material impact on the financial statements.

Northern Indiana is an active stakeholder in the process used in designing, testing and
implementing the ASM and in developing the surrounding business practices. On January 18, 2008,
Northern Indiana as part of a Joint Petition among several other Indiana utilities “Joint
Petitioners” filed a request to the IURC to participate in ASM and seek approval of timely cost
recovery for the associated costs of participating. On August 13, 2008, the IURC issued a Phase I
order, authorizing the Joint Petitioners authority to transfer additional balancing authority
functions and to implement the operational changes necessary to participate in the ASM and to seek
recovery of modified MISO charge-types via the FAC and to defer certain other MISO charge-types,
pending a final determination on the issue of cost recovery. This order also created a subdocket
for the purpose of further consideration of whether a cost-benefit analysis of participation in
MISO or the MISO ASM should be required. Phase II of this proceeding deals with how the Joint
Petitioners will approach the ASM, specifically related to operating reserves, and the specifics
regarding cost recovery. The evidentiary hearing for Phase II concluded on February 9, 2009. The
market began on January 6, 2009. At this time, Northern Indiana is not yet able to determine what
impact the ASM will have on its operations or cash flows.

Cost Recovery and Trackers.

A significant portion of the Northern Indiana’s revenue is related to
the recovery of fuel costs to generate power and the fuel costs related to purchased power. These
costs are recovered through a FAC, a standard, quarterly, “summary” regulatory proceeding in
Indiana. Various interveners, including the OUCC, have taken issue with costs included in Northern
Indiana’s FAC-80 filed in the summer of 2008, and the IURC has granted a sub-docket in this
proceeding. The intervening parties and Northern Indiana are discussing procedures to eliminate
these concerns. There is no procedural schedule established for this sub-docket.

On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for $329.7 million. This purchase was in
response to Northern Indiana’s need to add approximately 1,000 mw of new capacity. The Sugar Creek
facility is a CCGT located in West Terre Haute, Indiana and has a plant capacity rating of 535 mw.
Sugar Creek has transmission access to both the MISO and PJM Interconnection wholesale electricity
markets. In November 2008, an arrangement was reached to release Northern Indiana from its
contractual commitment binding the Sugar Creek power plant to provide capacity to PJM
Interconnection’s Reliability Pricing Model market. Effective December 1, 2008, Sugar Creek was
accepted as an internal designated network resource within the MISO.

The IURC issued an order on May 28, 2008 approving the purchase of Sugar Creek, but denied Northern
Indiana’s request for deferral of depreciation expense and carrying costs related to the plant,
beginning with the acquisition date, on the basis that the facility would not be used and useful
property under traditional regulation until the facility was operating inside of MISO. The order
also denied Northern Indiana’s request for alternative regulatory treatment of the plant, based on
incomplete presentation of evidence, but provided for the establishment of a subdocket to allow for
the proper presentation and consideration of alternative regulatory treatment. On June 6, 2008,
Northern Indiana filed its (a) Verified Petition for Rehearing; (b) Request for Establishment of a
Subdocket for Presentation and Consideration of an Alternative Regulatory Plan; and (c) Motion for
Consolidation (a single document) in Cause No. 43396. The IURC established a subdocket for
consideration of Northern Indiana’s Alternative Regulatory Plan.

Northern Indiana’s case-in-chief was filed with the IURC on September 26, 2008. The IURC, on
February 18, 2009, issued an order approving a settlement agreement filed in this proceeding
allowing Northern Indiana to begin deferring carrying costs and depreciation on Sugar Creek
effective on December 1, 2008 at the agreed to carrying cost rate of 6.5%. The terms of recovery
of the deferral will be resolved in Northern Indiana’s current rate proceeding.

Northern Indiana included a commitment to using renewable energy in its IRP filed in November 2007,
and a subsequent filing was made with the IURC, requesting approval for Northern Indiana to enter
into power purchase agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind-generated power
from Iowa and South Dakota, and requesting full recovery of all associated costs. On July 24,
2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indiana’s proposed purchase power agreement with
subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables. The agreement provides Northern Indiana the opportunity to
purchase 100 mw of wind power, which began in early 2009.

As part of a settlement agreement which resolved issues surrounding purchased power costs, Northern
Indiana implemented a new “benchmarking standard,” that became effective in October 2007, which
defines the price above which purchased power costs must be absorbed by Northern Indiana and are
not permitted to be passed on to ratepayers. The benchmark is based upon the costs of power
generated by a hypothetical natural gas fired units using gas purchased and delivered to Northern
Indiana and a set sharing mechanism. During the twelve months of 2008, the amount of purchased
power costs exceeding the benchmark amounted to $11.1 million, which was recognized as a net
reduction of revenues. The agreement also contemplated Northern Indiana adding generating capacity
to its existing portfolio by providing for the benchmark to be adjusted as new capacity is added.
The dispatch of Sugar Creek into MISO on December 1, 2008 triggered a change in the benchmark,
whereby the first 500 mw tier of the benchmark provision was eliminated.

On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC for an ECT. Under the ECT,
Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended
by Northern Indiana to implement IDEM’s NOx SIP through an ECRM and (2) related operation and
maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through
an EERM. Under the IURC’s November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings
on a semi-annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. In December 2006,
Northern Indiana filed a petition with the IURC for appropriate cost treatment and recovery of
emission control construction needed to address the Phase I CAIR requirements of the Indiana Air
Pollution Control Board’s CAIR rules that became effective on February 25, 2007. On July 3, 2007,
Northern Indiana received an IURC order issuing a CPCN for the CAIR and CAMR Phase I Compliance
Plan Projects, estimated to cost approximately $23 million. Northern Indiana includes the CAIR and
CAMR Phase I Compliance Plan costs to be recovered in the semi-annual and annual ECRM and annual
EERM filing six months after construction costs begin. On October 23, 2008, Northern Indiana filed
for approval of a revised cost estimate to meet the NOx and SO2 and mercury emissions environmental
standards. Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment of approximately $368 million.
This revised cost estimate was approved by the IURC on January 14, 2009. On October 1, 2008, the
IURC approved ECR-12 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $267.7 million.
Northern Indiana filed ECR-13 and EER-6 in February 2009, for net capital expenditures and expense
of $270.0 million and $18.7 million, respectively. In the electric base rate case, Northern
Indiana has proposed that the frequency of the EERM be changed from annual to semi-annual,
simultaneous with the filing of the ECRM. In addition, Northern Indiana proposed that the EERM be
used to pass through to ratepayers the cost of any emission allowance purchases and the proceeds of
any emission allowance sales.

9. Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities

NiSource uses commodity-based derivative financial instruments primarily to manage commodity price
risk and interest rate risk exposure in its business as well as for commercial and industrial
sales. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. NiSource accounts for its
derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133. Under SFAS No. 133, if certain conditions are met, a
derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair
value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the
exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. Additionally, certain NiSource
subsidiaries enter into forward physical contracts with various third parties to procure natural
gas or power for its operational

During 2008 and 2007, a loss of $0.3 million and gain of $0.3 million, net of taxes respectively,
were recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted
for as hedges. All derivatives classified as a hedge are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with
any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as a regulatory asset
or liability per SFAS No. 71 as appropriate. During 2008 and 2007, NiSource did not reclassify any
amounts related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to
earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur. It is
anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge
contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $53.9 million of loss, net of taxes.

value, but because these derivatives are used within the framework
of the companies’ gas cost recovery mechanism, regulatory assets or liabilities are recorded to
offset the change in the fair value of these derivatives.

Northern Indiana offers a PPS as an alternative to the standard gas cost recovery mechanism. This
service provides Northern Indiana customers with the opportunity to either lock in their gas cost
or place a cap on the gas costs that could be charged in future months. In order to hedge the
anticipated physical purchases associated with these obligations, Northern Indiana has purchased
NYMEX futures, NYMEX options and basis contracts that correspond to a fixed or capped price in the
associated future delivery months and currently enters into forward physical purchase contracts and
NYMEX options to secure forward gas prices. Columbia of Virginia started a program in April 2005
similar to the Northern Indiana PPS, which allows non-jurisdictional customers the opportunity to
lock in their future gas costs. The NYMEX futures and option contracts associated with these
programs are generally designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges and Northern Indiana elects
the normal purchase normal sale exemption under SFAS No. 133 for its forward physical contracts
associated with this program.

Northern Indiana also offers a DependaBill program to its customers as an alternative to the
standard tariff rate that is charged to residential customers. The program allows Northern Indiana
customers to fix their total monthly bill in future months at a flat rate regardless of gas usage
or commodity cost. In order to hedge the anticipated physical purchases associated with these
obligations, Northern Indiana has purchased NYMEX futures, NYMEX options and basis contracts, and
currently enters into forward physical purchase contracts and NYMEX options to secure forward gas
prices. The NYMEX futures contracts associated with this program are generally designated and
accounted for as cash flow hedges and Northern Indiana elects the normal purchase normal sale
exemption under SFAS No. 133 for its forward physical contracts associated with this program.

As part of the MISO Day 2 initiative, Northern Indiana was allocated and has purchased FTRs. These
FTRs help Northern Indiana offset congestion costs due to the MISO Day 2 activity. The FTRs are
marked to fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, but since congestion costs
are recoverable through the fuel cost recovery mechanism, the related gains and losses associated
with marking these derivatives to market are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability, in
accordance with SFAS No. 71. In the second quarter of 2008, MISO changed its allocation procedures
from an allocation of FTRs to an allocation of ARRs, whereby Northern Indiana was allocated ARRs
based on its historical use of the MISO administered transmission system. ARRs entitle the holder
to a stream of revenues or charges based on the price of the associated FTR in the FTR auction.
Northern Indiana converted the ARRs that were received in the second quarter of 2008 into FTRs.
Additionally, Northern Indiana also uses derivative contracts to minimize risk associated with
power price volatility.

For regulatory incentive purposes, Northern Indiana enters into gas purchase contracts at first of
the month prices that give counterparties the daily option to either sell an additional package of
gas at first of the month prices or recall the original volume to be delivered. Northern Indiana
charges a fee for this option. The changes in the fair value of these options are primarily due to
the changing expectations of the future intra-month volatility of gas prices. These written
options are derivative instruments, must be marked to fair value and do not meet the requirement
for hedge accounting treatment. However, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, Northern Indiana records
the related gains and losses associated with these transactions as a regulatory asset or liability.

For regulatory incentive purposes, Columbia of Kentucky, Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of
Pennsylvania, and Columbia of Maryland (collectively, the “Columbia LDCs”) enter into contracts
that allow counterparties the option to sell gas to Columbia LDCs at first of the month prices for
a particular month of delivery. Columbia LDCs charge the counterparties a fee for this option.
The changes in the fair value of the options are primarily due to the changing expectations of the
future intra-month volatility of gas prices. These Columbia LDCs defer a portion of the change in
the fair value of the options as either a regulatory asset or liability in accordance with SFAS No.
71 based on the regulatory customer sharing mechanisms in place, with the remaining changes in fair
value recognized currently in earnings.

In 2008 and in prior years, Columbia Energy Services had fixed price gas delivery commitments to
three municipalities in the United States and related swap agreements that have all expired as of
December, 2008. Columbia Energy Services entered into a forward purchase agreement with a gas
supplier, wherein the supplier fulfilled the delivery obligation requirements at a slight premium
to index. In order to hedge this anticipated future purchase of gas from the gas supplier,
Columbia Energy Services entered into commodity swaps priced at the locations designated for
physical delivery. These commodity swap derivatives were accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Interest Rate Risk Activities.

NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify
the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long-term debt from fixed to variable. On May
12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in a
notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2-year term. NiSource Finance
will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount
based on U.S. 6-month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of
premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the
swaps on May 15, 2009. On September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed-to-variable
interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110 million.

On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in
a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11-year term. NiSource Finance
will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount
based on U.S. 6-month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of
premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the
swaps on July 15, 2013.

As stated above, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed-to-variable interest
rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110 million. NiSource
Finance elected to terminate the swap when Lehman Holdings Inc., guarantor under the applicable
International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreement, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement
between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. The mark-to-market close-out
value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and
was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. The termination of this swap did not impact
NiSource’s ability to assert hedge accounting for its remaining fixed-to-variable interest rate
swap agreements.

As a result of the fixed-to-variable interest rate swap transactions referenced above, $1,050
million of NiSource Finance’s existing long-term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest
rates. These interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges. The effectiveness of the
interest rate swaps in offsetting the exposure to changes in the debt’s fair value is measured
pursuant to SFAS No. 133. NiSource had no net gain or loss recognized in earnings due to hedging
ineffectiveness from prior years.

Contemporaneously with the issuance on September 16, 2005 of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes, NiSource
Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six
counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being
amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to an increase to interest expense
over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88%,
respectively. As of December 31, 2008, $16.0 million is in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) related to forward starting interest rate swap settlement.

10. Variable Interest Entities and Equity Investments

A. Variable Interest Entities.

On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R which required a
variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority
of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity’s activities or is entitled to receive a
majority of the entity’s residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity
is the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a
corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that
either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do
not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also
requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to
consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2004, NiSource has consolidated certain low income housing real
estate investments per FIN 46R, from which NiSource derives certain tax benefits for its
investment. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, NiSource increased its long-term debt by
approximately $12.8 million and $13.0 million, respectively, as a result of consolidating these
investments. However, this debt is nonrecourse to NiSource and NiSource’s direct and indirect
subsidiaries.

B. Equity Investments.

Certain investments of NiSource are accounted for under the equity
method of accounting. Income and losses from Millennium and Hardy Storage are reflected in Equity
Earnings (Loss) in Unconsolidated Affiliates on NiSource’s Statements of Consolidated Income.
These investments are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Income
and losses from all other equity investments are reflected in Other, net on NiSource’s Statements
of Consolidated Income. All investments shown as limited partnerships are limited partnership
interests.

The effective income tax rates were 33.4%, 35.2%, and 35.6% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
The 1.8% decrease in the overall effective tax rate in 2008 versus 2007 was primarily the result of
a change in Massachusetts state taxes discussed below. The 0.4% decrease in the overall effective
tax rate in 2007 versus 2006 is due to higher Section 199 deductions, lower regulatory flow-through
depreciation, and the capitalization of the tax impact of AFUDC-Equity to a regulatory asset.
These decreases were offset by increased state income tax expense.

On July 3, 2008, the Governor of Massachusetts signed into law a bill that significantly changed
the Massachusetts corporate income tax regime. Under the new law, which became effective for tax
years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, NiSource calculates its Massachusetts income tax
liability on a unitary basis, meaning that the income tax obligation to the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts is determined based on an apportioned share of all of
NiSource’s income, rather than just the income of NiSource’s subsidiaries doing business in
Massachusetts. Because of NiSource’s substantial operations outside of Massachusetts, the new law
has the impact of reducing the deferred income tax liability to Massachusetts. Under SFAS No. 109,
NiSource must recognize the impact of this

tax law change in the quarter it is enacted. As a result, income tax expense and deferred income
tax were reduced by $14.9 million in 2008.

On December 9, 2008, Columbia Transmission converted from a corporation to a limited liability
company. Under the Internal Revenue Code and most state income tax provisions, limited liability
companies with just one owner are treated as entities that are disregarded as separate from their
owners. As such, for federal and state income tax purposes, Columbia Transmission is treated as a
division of Columbia, its parent corporation. Upon conversion, NiSource recorded additional
deferred tax benefits of $4.6 million on its Consolidated Balance Sheet and in its Statement of
Consolidated Income.

Deferred income taxes resulted from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. The principal components of
NiSource’s net deferred tax liability were as follows:

Included under Other, net in the table above, are state income tax net operating loss benefits of
$11.7 million and $13.2 million, as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. This tax loss
carryforward expires after tax year 2009. NiSource anticipates it will ultimately realize $0.4
million and $2.8 million of these benefits as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007,
respectively, prior to their expiration. As such, a valuation allowance of $11.3 million and $10.4
million, as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007,
respectively, has been recorded. The $0.9 million increase in the valuation allowance from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 is due to
tax benefits recorded in 2008 related to the Tawney settlement. The size of the estimated benefits
on the settlement resulted in a change in estimate in the carryforward to be utilized prior to the
expiration of the tax net operating loss at the end of 2009.

On January 1, 2007, NiSource adopted the provisions of FIN 48. As a result of the implementation
of FIN 48, NiSource recognized a charge of $0.9 million to the opening balance of retained
earnings, which includes the adjustment to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits shown below.
The total amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was
$16.0 million, which was included in “Other noncurrent liabilities,” on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, NiSource recognized the following changes in

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2007, are $2.9 million of tax
benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Also included in the balance of
unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2007, are $7.5 million of tax benefits that, if recognized,
would result in an increase to Gain on Disposition of Discontinued Operations and $5.6 million of
tax benefits that, if recognized, would result in adjustments to deferred taxes.

Reconciliation of the change in unrecognized tax benefits recorded on the Consolidated Balance

As of December 31, 2008, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a reduction of $0.2 million in the
liability for unrecognized tax benefits from the January 1, 2008 amount. The $0.2 million
reduction is based on the actual 2007 tax filings versus estimated amounts recorded at year-end
2007. As of December 31, 2007, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflected a reduction of $12.3
million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits from the January 1, 2007 amount. The
liability was reduced by $1.6 million primarily to reflect negotiations associated with NiSource’s
1999-2002 Tax Court petition and by $7.5 million to reflect the issuance of additional tax guidance
in the first quarter of 2007. In addition, NiSource reclassified $3.5 million of its liability for
unrecognized tax benefits to taxes accrued to reflect settlement of the Tax Court petition and the
completion of the 2003-2004 IRS audit. Additional accruals for 2007 year issues increased the
liability by $0.8 million, while the lapse in the statute of limitations resulted in a $0.5 million
decrease.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 that, if
recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $3.5 million and $3.7 million, respectively. As
of December 31, 2007, NiSource did not anticipate any significant changes to its liability for
unrecognized tax benefits over the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, and NiSource does not
anticipate any significant changes to its December 31, 2008 liability for unrecognized tax benefits
over the twelve months ended December 31, 2009.

Effective January 1, 2007, NiSource recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Prior to January 1, 2007, NiSource recognized
such accrued interest in interest expense and penalties in other expenses. During the year ended
December 31, 2006 NiSource recognized approximately $1.3 million of interest in the Statement of
Consolidated Income. No amounts had been estimated or accrued for penalties. Upon adoption of
FIN 48 on January 1, 2007, NiSource decreased its accrual for interest on unrecognized tax benefits
to $3.3 million, resulting in a $0.1 million, net of tax, increase to the opening balance of
retained earnings. As of December 31, 2007, there is $0.4 million of interest related to
unrecognized tax benefits recorded on the balance sheet. During 2007, NiSource recorded $0.3
million of interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense on the
income statement, while $0.9 million was paid as a result of settlements with federal and state
taxing authorities and $2.3 million of accrued interest was reversed through discontinued
operations. No amounts have been estimated or accrued for penalties in 2007. For the year ended
December 31, 2008, NiSource recorded additional interest expense of $0.2 million on unrecognized
tax benefits. There were no accruals for penalties recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as
of December 31, 2008.

NiSource is subject to income taxation in the United States and various state jurisdictions,
primarily Indiana, West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Maine, Louisiana, Mississippi, Maryland, Michigan, Tennessee, New Jersey and New York.

Because NiSource is part of the IRS’s Large and Mid-Size Business program, each year’s federal
income tax return is typically audited by the IRS. As of December 31, 2008, tax years through 2004
have been audited and are closed

to further assessment. The audit of tax years 2005, 2006 and 2007 is scheduled to begin on March
31, 2009. As of December 31, 2007, tax years through 2004 had been audited, but the statutes of
limitations for tax years 2003 and 2004 were still open to assessment.

The statute of limitations in each of the state jurisdictions in which NiSource operates remain
open until the years are settled for federal income tax purposes, at which time amended state
income tax returns reflecting all federal income tax adjustments are filed. As of December 31,
2008, the state of Texas was auditing the company for tax periods 2005 through 2007. That audit
was completed in January 2009. The state of Mississippi began its audit of tax years 2004 through
2007 in January 2009 and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has notified the company it will begin
its audit of tax year 2006 in June 2009. In addition, the state of Indiana has notified NiSource
it will begin an audit of tax years 2005, 2006 and 2007 in March 2009. As of December 31, 2007,
there were no state income tax audits in progress.

12. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

NiSource provides defined contribution plans and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans
that cover its employees. Benefits under the defined benefit retirement plans reflect the
employees’ compensation, years of service and age at retirement. Additionally, NiSource provides
health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. The majority of employees
may become eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement age while working for NiSource.
The expected cost of such benefits is accrued during the employees’ years of service. Current
rates of rate-regulated companies include postretirement benefit costs, including amortization of
the regulatory assets that arose prior to inclusion of these costs in rates. For most plans, cash
contributions are remitted to grantor trusts.

Adoption of SFAS No. 158 — Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158 to improve existing
reporting for defined benefit postretirement plans by requiring employers to recognize in the
statement of financial position the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit
postretirement plan, among other changes. In the fourth quarter of 2006, NiSource adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 158.

On January 1, 2007, NiSource adopted the SFAS No. 158 measurement date provisions requiring
employers to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the fiscal year-end. The pre-tax
impact of adopting the SFAS No. 158 measurement date provisions increased deferred charges and
other assets by $9.4 million, decreased regulatory assets by $89.6 million, decreased retained
earnings by $11.3 million, increased accumulated other comprehensive income by $5.3 million and
decreased accrued liabilities for postretirement and postemployment benefits by $74.2 million.
NiSource also recorded a reduction in deferred income taxes of approximately $2.6 million. In
addition, 2007 expense for pension and postretirement benefits reflects the updated measurement
date valuations.

NiSource Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans’ Asset Management

.

NiSource employs a
total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to
maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. Risk tolerance is
established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and asset class
volatility. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income
investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as
well as growth, value, small and large capitalizations. Other assets such as private equity and
hedge funds are used judiciously to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio
diversification. Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely
manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of
the underlying assets. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through
quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability
studies.

NiSource utilizes a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and
rebalancing in determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are
studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are analyzed to
ensure that they are consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with
higher volatility generate greater return over the long run. Current

market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market
assumptions are determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for
reasonability and appropriateness.

The most important component of an investment strategy is the portfolio asset mix, or the
allocation between the various classes of securities available to the pension plan for investment
purposes. The asset mix and acceptable minimum and maximum ranges established represents a

The categorization of investments into the asset classes in the table above are based on
definitions established by the NiSource Retirement and Investment Committee. Alternative
investments consist primarily of private equity and hedge fund investments. As of December 31,
2008, $269.9 million of defined benefit pension assets and $18.4 million of other postretirement
benefit assets included in international equities or fixed income asset classes in the
table above would be considered alternative investments, as that term is defined by the AICPA, in
addition to those investments in the alternative investments asset class. As of December 31, 2007,
approximately $356 million of defined benefit pension assets included in international equities or
fixed income asset classes in the table above would be considered alternative investments.
Alternative investments are defined in the AICPA practice aid on audit considerations for
alternative investments as investments not listed on national exchanges or over-the-counter
markets, or for which quoted market prices are not available from sources such as financial
publications, the exchanges or NASDAQ.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Alternative
investment values are based on estimates developed by external
investment managers and subject to a review process performed by
management. In
making such valuation determinations, the investment managers consider factors that may include the
cost of the investment, developments since the acquisition of the investment, comparisons to
similar publicly traded investments, subsequent purchases of the same investment by other
investors, the current financial position and operating results of the issuer and such other
factors as may be deemed relevant. A range of possible values exist for these securities, and
therefore, the estimated values may differ from the values that would have been recorded had a
ready market for these securities existed.

During 2008, the S&P 500 Index declined nearly 38.5% while at the same time, corporate bond prices
also declined as a result of the current economic crisis. The MSCI EAFE Index, a common benchmark
for international equities also declined over 43% during 2008. Similarly, NiSource pension plan
assets and other postretirement plan assets declined as a result of negative returns amounting to
30.3% and 31.8%, respectively

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

NiSource’s accumulated benefit obligation for its pension plans was $2,085.5 million and $2,080.6
million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation as of
a date is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to
employee service rendered prior to that date and based on current and past compensation levels.
The accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation disclosed in the
table above in that it includes no assumptions about future compensation levels.

NiSource’s pension plans were underfunded by $712.5 million at December 31, 2008 compared to being
overfunded at December 31, 2007 by $79.4 million. The decline in funded status was due primarily
to unfavorable returns on plan assets as previously described, partially offset by an increase in
discount rate from the prior measurement date. NiSource contributed $5.8 million and $66.3 million
to its pension plans in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

NiSource’s funded status for its other postretirement benefit plans declined by $47.1 million to an
unfunded status of $502.8 million due primarily to unfavorable asset returns partially offset by
the increase in discount rate from the prior measurement date. NiSource contributed $50.6 million
and $50.5 million to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2008 and 2007, respectively. No
amounts of NiSource’s pension or other postretirement plans’ assets are expected to be returned to
NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in 2009.

The following table provides the key assumptions that were used to calculate the pension and other
postretirement benefits obligations for NiSource’s various plans as of December 31.

Considering the turmoil in the financial markets during 2008, NiSource believes it is appropriate
to assume an 8.75% rate of return on pension plan assets for its calculation of 2009 pension
benefits cost.

B. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan.

NiSource offers a Dividend Reinvestment and
Stock Purchase Plan which allows participants to reinvest dividends and make voluntary cash
payments to purchase additional shares of common stock on the open market.

15. Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, NiSource adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition
method. SFAS No. 123R requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair
value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards
expected to vest.

NiSource currently issues long-term incentive grants to key management employees under a long-term
incentive plan approved by stockholders on April 13, 1994 (1994 Plan). The 1994 Plan, as amended
and restated, permits the following types of grants, separately or in combination: nonqualified
stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights,
performance units, contingent stock awards and dividend equivalents payable on grants of options,
performance units and contingent stock awards.

At December 31, 2008, there were 28,093,287 shares reserved for future awards under the amended and
restated 1994 Plan.

NiSource recognized stock-based employee compensation expense of $9.5 million, $4.4 million and
$6.9 million during the years of 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, as well as related tax benefits
of $3.2 million, $1.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested
awards amounted to $12.0 million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining
requisite service period of 1.7 years.

Stock Options.

Option grants are granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high
and low market price on the day of the grant. The weighted average remaining contractual life of
the options outstanding and exercisable is 4 years. Stock option transactions for the year ended
December 31, 2008 are as follows:

No options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006.

Restricted Stock Awards

. In 2008, NiSource granted restricted stock units of 244,907, subject to
service conditions. The total grant date fair value of the restricted units was $4.1 million,
based on the average market price of
NiSource’s common stock at the date of each grant, which will be expensed net of forfeitures over
the vesting period of approximately three years. The service conditions for 208,609 awards lapse
on January 31, 2011. If before January 31, 2011, the employee terminates employment (1) due to
retirement, having attained age 55 and completed ten years of service, or (2) due to death or
disability, the employment conditions will lapse with respect to a pro rata portion of the
restricted units on the date of termination. Termination due to any other reason will result in
all restricted units awarded being forfeited effective the employee’s date of termination.
Employees will be entitled to receive dividends upon vesting. The remaining 36,298 awards vest
evenly over a three year period ending December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2008, 232,808
nonvested restricted stock units were granted and outstanding for the 2008 award.

Time-accelerated Awards.

NiSource awarded restricted shares and restricted stock units that contain
provisions for time-accelerated vesting to key executives under the 1994 Plan. Most of these
awards were issued in January 2003 and January 2004. These awards of restricted stock or
restricted stock units generally vest over a period of six years or, in the case of restricted
stock units at age 62 if an employee would become age 62 within six years, but not less than three
years. If certain predetermined criteria involving measures of total shareholder return are met,
as measured at the end of the third year after the grant date, the awards vest at the end of the
third year. At December 31, 2008, NiSource had 504,633 nonvested awards which contain the
time-accelerated provisions. The total shareholder return measures established for the 2003 and
2004 awards were not met; therefore these grants did not have an accelerated vesting period.

that contain provisions for time-accelerated vesting for the year ended December 31, 2008:

Contingent Share Awards.

In 2008, NiSource granted contingent stock units of 417,196 subject to
performance conditions. The total grant date fair value of the award was $7.1 million, based on
the average market price of NiSource’s common stock at the date of each grant, which will be
expensed net of forfeitures over the vesting period of approximately three years. The performance
conditions are based on achievement of a non-GAAP financial measure, cumulative net operating
earnings, that NiSource defines as income from continuing operations adjusted for certain items and
cumulative funds from operations that NiSource defines as net operating cash flows provided by
continuing operations. Per the agreement, to the extent base performance conditions are exceeded
during the three year performance period, the award will be increased in increments of 10% up to
50%. If prior to the lapse of the performance conditions, the employee terminates employment (1)
due to retirement, having attained age 55 and completed ten years of service, (2) due to
disability, or (3) due to death with less than or equal to 12 months remaining in the performance
period, the employee will receive a pro rata portion of the contingent shares if the performance
conditions have been met. If prior to the lapse of the performance conditions, the employee
terminates employment due to death with more than 12 months remaining in the performance period,
the employee will receive a pro rata portion of the contingent shares as if the performance
conditions had been met. Termination due to any other reason will result in all contingent shares
awarded being forfeited effective the employee’s date of termination. Employees will be entitled
to receive dividends upon vesting. As of December 31, 2008, 417,196 nonvested contingent stock
units were granted and outstanding for the 2008 award.

In March 2007, 320,330 contingent stock units were granted. The grant date fair value of the award
was $7.5 million, based on the average market price of NiSource’s common stock at the date of grant
of $23.46, which will be expensed net of forfeitures over the vesting period of approximately three
years. The shares are subject to both performance and service conditions. The performance
conditions were based on achievement of a non-GAAP financial measure (net operating earnings) as
described above. Per the agreement, to the extent base performance conditions were exceeded, the
award would be increased in increments of 10% up to 50%. If the performance conditions were not
met, the grants would be cancelled and the shares would be forfeited. Subsequent to meeting

the performance conditions, an additional two year service period will then be required before the
shares vest on December 31, 2009. If after completing the performance conditions but prior to
completing the service conditions the employee terminates employment (1) due to retirement, having
attained age 55 and completed ten years of service, or (2) due to death or disability, the
employment conditions will lapse with respect to a pro rata portion of the contingent shares on the
date of termination. Termination due to any other reason will result in all contingent shares
awarded being forfeited effective the employee’s date of termination. During 2007, base
performance conditions were exceeded, resulting in an increase of the number of shares to be issued
upon vesting by 20%. Accordingly, 62,319 additional shares were granted in January 2008. As of
December 31, 2008, 357,799 nonvested contingent shares were outstanding. Employees will be
entitled to receive dividends upon vesting.

Non-employee Director Awards.

The Amended and Restated Non-employee Director Stock Incentive Plan
provides for awards of restricted stock, stock options and restricted stock units, which vest in
20% increments per year, with full vesting after five years. Effective March 25, 2008, the Board
approved an amendment to the vesting provisions of the plan such that all outstanding grants and
future grants of restricted stock units will vest immediately. The plan requires that restricted
stock units be distributed to the directors after their separation from the Board. As of December
31, 2008, 89,860 restricted shares and 226,186 restricted stock units had been issued under the
Plan.

16. Long-Term Debt

NiSource Finance is a wholly-owned, consolidated finance subsidiary of NiSource that engages in
financing activities to raise funds for the business operations of NiSource and its subsidiaries.
NiSource Finance was incorporated in February 2000 under the laws of the state of Indiana.
NiSource Finance’s obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NiSource. Consequently
no separate financial statements for NiSource Finance are required to be reported.

During July 2008, Northern Indiana redeemed $24.0 million of its medium-term notes, with an average
interest rate of 6.80%.

On May 15, 2008, NiSource Finance issued $500.0 million of 6.80% unsecured notes that mature
January 15, 2019 and $200.0 million of 6.15% unsecured notes that mature on March 1, 2013. The
notes due in 2013 constitute a further issuance of the $345.0 million 6.15% notes issued February
19, 2003, and will form a single series having an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $545.0
million.

On December 31, 2007, Whiting Clean Energy redeemed $292.1 of its notes due June 20, 2011, having
an average interest rate of 8.30%. The associated redemption premium of $40.6 million was charged
to loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt. The redemption was financed with NiSource
borrowings.

On December 21, 2007, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for an unspecified
principal amount of debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. NiSource is
classified as a well-known seasoned issuer and the registration statement will be effective for
three years.

On December 3, 2007, Capital Markets redeemed $72.0 million of its $75.0 million of 6.78% senior
notes due December 1, 2027. The notes contained a provision entitling holders to require Capital
Markets to purchase the notes at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest on December 1,
2007.

On October 31, 2007, Northern Indiana redeemed $24.0 million of its Variable Rate Demand Pollution
Control Refunding Bonds, Series 1988D, issued by Jasper County, Indiana on behalf of Northern
Indiana with a floating interest rate of 3.645% at time of redemption.

On August 31, 2007, NiSource Finance issued $800.0 million of 6.40%, 10.5-year senior unsecured
notes that mature March 15, 2018.

During August 2007, Northern Indiana redeemed $20.0 million of its medium-term notes with an
average interest rate of 6.77%.

rate of 7.25%.

During April 2007, NiSource redeemed $27.0 million of Capital Markets medium-term notes, with an
average interest rate of 7.49%.

Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds

.

Northern Indiana has seven series of Jasper County
Pollution Control Bonds with a total principal value of $254 million currently outstanding. Prior
to March 25, 2008, each of the series bore interest at rates established through auctions that took
place at either 7, 28, or 35 day intervals. Between February 13, 2008 and March 5, 2008, Northern
Indiana received notice that six separate market auctions of four series of the Jasper County
Pollution Control Bonds had failed. As a result, those series representing an aggregate principal
amount of $112 million of the Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds bore interest at default rates
equal to 15% or 18% per annum. Subsequent auctions were successful, but resulted in interest rates
between 5.13% and 11.0%, which were in excess of historical market rates. These auction failures
were attributable to the lack of liquidity in the auction rate securities market, largely driven by
the turmoil in the bond insurance market. The Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds are insured by
either Ambac Assurance Corporation or MBIA Insurance Corporation.

Northern Indiana converted all seven series of Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds from the
auction rate mode to a variable rate demand bond mode between March 25, 2008 and April 11, 2008 and
repurchased the bonds as part of the conversion process. Between April 11, 2008 and August 24,
2008, all of the Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds were held in Northern Indiana’s treasury.
On August 25, 2008, Northern Indiana converted all of the Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds
from a variable rate demand mode to a fixed rate mode, and reoffered the bonds to external
investors. As a result of the fixed rate conversion and reoffering process, the weighted average
interest rate is now fixed at 5.58%.

Northern Indiana reflected the Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds as an offset to long-term debt
within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet (unaudited) as of March 31 and June 30, 2008 upon
repurchase and the debt was considered extinguished per SFAS No. 140. As such, unamortized debt
expense of $4.6 million previously recorded under deferred charges and other was reclassified to a
regulatory asset. The Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008 reflects the reissuance
of the long term debt. The repurchase and the subsequent re-issuance of these bonds are included
under, “Financing Activities,” in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flow.

Following are the outstanding long-term debt sinking fund requirements and maturities at December
31, 2008. The long-term debt maturities shown below include capital lease obligations but exclude
unamortized premium and discount on long-term debt, and exclude the debt of certain low-income
housing real estate investments, as NiSource does not guarantee the long-term debt payment of these
entities. Under the provisions of FIN No. 46R, the low-income housing real estate investments were
required to be consolidated beginning in the first quarter of 2004.

Unamortized debt expense, premium and discount on long-term debt applicable to outstanding bonds
are being amortized over the lives of such bonds. Reacquisition premiums have been deferred and
are being amortized. These premiums are not earning a regulatory return during the recovery
period.

Of NiSource’s long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2008, $109.0 million was issued by
NiSource’s affiliate, Capital Markets. The financial obligations of Capital Markets are subject to
a Support Agreement between NiSource and Capital Markets, under which NiSource has committed to
make payments of interest and principal on Capital Market’s obligations in the event of a failure
to pay by Capital Markets. Under the terms of the Support Agreement, in addition to the cash flow
from cash dividends paid to NiSource by any of its consolidated subsidiaries, the assets of
NiSource, other than the stock and assets of Northern Indiana, are available as recourse for the
benefit of Capital Market’s creditors. The carrying value of the NiSource assets, excluding the
assets of Northern Indiana, was $14.7 billion at December 31, 2008.

NiSource Finance has entered into interest rate swap agreements for $1,050 million of its
outstanding long-term debt. The effect of these agreements is to modify the interest rate
characteristics of a portion of their respective long-term debt from fixed to variable. Refer to
Note 9, “Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information regarding interest rate swaps.

NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five-year revolving credit facility and the
two-year term loan facility that was entered into in February 2009,
and is discussed in Note 27, “Subsequent Events.” This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization
ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in the 2005 private placement requires NiSource
to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2008, the
ratio was 61.6%.

NiSource is also subject to certain other covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such
covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSource’s assets,
generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting
security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to
$150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and/or transfer of
NiSource’s assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit
facilities also include a cross-default provision, which triggers an event of default under the
credit facility in the event of any uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of
NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more.

NiSource’s bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However,
NiSource’s bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured
payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on
NiSource’s assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests,
preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSource’s
consolidated net tangible assets.

17. Short-Term Borrowings

On September 23, 2008, NiSource supplemented its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility (which
extends into 2011) with a new $500 million credit agreement. This agreement was designed to
provide ample liquidity to fund ongoing operations and accommodate the company’s seasonal cash flow
requirements, such as the purchase of natural gas supplies to meet customer needs, as well as to
provide for short-term payment requirements related to the Tawney

settlement.
On February 13, 2009, this six-month credit facility was terminated in conjunction with
the closing of a new two-year bank term loan facility.

As of December 31, 2008, NiSource had $83.5 million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding under
its five-year revolving credit facility. NiSource Finance maintains a five-year revolving line of
credit with a syndicate of financial institutions which can be used either for borrowings or the
issuance of letters of credit.

Short-term borrowings were as follows:

Price risk management assets and liabilities include commodity exchange-traded and
non-exchange-based derivative contracts. Exchange-traded derivative contracts are generally based
on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial
assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance
risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non-exchange-traded derivatives are
valued using broker or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges. In such cases, these
non-exchange-traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non-exchange-based derivative
instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may
utilize models to measure fair value. The company uses a similar model to value similar
instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets
or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and
market-corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable
market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially
the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain
derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and
models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the
measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in
the fair value

calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange-traded. Credit exposures are adjusted
to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures.

Price risk management assets also include fixed-to-floating interest-rate swaps, which are
designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable-rate debt as
a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future
outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current
fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well
as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are
based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest-rate swaps are
categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value
calculation of the interest rate swap.

Available-for-sale securities are investments pledged as collateral for trust accounts related to
NiSource’s wholly-owned insurance company. Available-for-sale securities are included within
“Other investments” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Securities classified within Level 1
include U.S. Treasury debt securities which are highly liquid and are actively traded in
over-the-counter markets. NiSource values corporate and mortgage-backed debt securities using a
matrix pricing model that incorporates market-based information. These securities trade less
frequently and are classified within Level 2. Unrealized gains and losses from available-for-sale
securities are included in other comprehensive income

As part of the MISO Day 2 initiative, Northern Indiana was allocated and has purchased FTRs. These
rights help Northern Indiana offset congestion costs due to the MISO Day 2 activity. These
instruments are considered derivatives and are valued utilizing forecasted congestion source and
sink prices in the Day Ahead market. They are classified as Level 3 and reflected in the table
above. The FTRs do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, but since congestion costs are
recoverable through the fuel cost recovery mechanism, the related gains and losses associated with
marking these derivatives to market are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability, in accordance
with SFAS No. 71. Northern Indiana also writes options for regulatory incentive purposes which are
also considered Level 3 valuations and accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 71. Realized
gains and losses for these Level 3 recurring items are included in income within, Cost of Sales, on
the Statements of Consolidated Income. Unrealized gains and losses from Level 3 recurring items
are included within, Regulatory assets or Regulatory liabilities, on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

B. Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value.

NiSource has certain financial instruments
that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but nevertheless are recorded at amounts
that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature, including cash and cash
equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable,
accounts payable, customer deposits and short-term borrowings. The company’s long-term borrowings
are recorded at historical amounts unless designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge under
SFAS No. 133.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of
financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.

Investments.

NiSource has corporate owned life insurance which is accounted for in accordance with
FTB 85-4 and recorded at cash surrender value. NiSource’s investments in corporate owned life
insurance at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $17.7 million and $19.7 million.

Long-term Debt.

The fair values of these securities are estimated based on the quoted market
prices for the same or similar issues or on the rates offered for securities of the same remaining
maturities. Certain premium costs associated with the early settlement of long-term debt are not
taken into consideration in determining fair value.

Sale of Trade Accounts Receivable.

On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to
sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CORC, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement with Dresdner
Bank AG, also dated May 14, 2004, under the terms of which it sells an undivided percentage
ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. On July 1, 2006, the
agreement was amended to increase the program limit from $300 million to $350 million. The
agreement currently expires on June 26, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, $236.5 million of accounts
receivable had been sold by CORC compared to $202.4 million as of December 31, 2007.

Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping
and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives
a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services.

On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of
its trade receivables, as they originate, to NRC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana.
NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement with Citibank, N.A. under the terms of which it sells an
undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit.
The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. NRC’s
agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled expiration date of December 18, 2009,
and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2008, NRC had sold
$119.0 million of accounts receivable compared to $200.0 million as of December 31, 2007. Under
the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indiana’s debt
rating falls below BBB- or Baa3 by Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s, respectively.

Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and
cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which
provides adequate compensation, for such services.

NiSource’s accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting based upon the conditions met
in SFAS No. 140. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor
and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or
other receivership. The transferors do not retain any interest in the receivables under both
agreements.

19. Other Commitments and Contingencies

A. Guarantees and Indemnities.

As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries
enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on
behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit.
These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise
attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient
credit to accomplish the subsidiaries’ intended commercial purposes. The total guarantees and
indemnities in existence at December 31, 2008 and the years in which they expire were:

Guarantees of Subsidiaries Debt.

NiSource has guaranteed the payment of $5.8 billion of debt for
various wholly-owned subsidiaries including NiSource Finance, and through a support agreement,
Capital Markets, which is reflected on NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The subsidiaries
are required to comply with certain financial covenants under the debt indenture and in the event
of default, NiSource would be obligated to pay the debt’s principal and related interest. NiSource
does not anticipate its subsidiaries will have any difficulty maintaining compliance.

Guarantees Supporting Energy Commodity Contracts of Subsidiaries.

NiSource has issued guarantees,
which support up to approximately $497.4 million of commodity-related payments for its current
subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and trading and those satisfying requirements under
forward gas sales agreements of current and former subsidiaries. These guarantees were provided to
counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and
electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity-related contracts subject to
these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Lines and Letters of Credit.

NiSource Finance maintains a five-year revolving line of credit with
a syndicate of financial institutions which can be used either for borrowings or the issuance of
letters of credit. On July 7, 2006, NiSource Finance amended the $1.25 billion five-year revolving
credit facility, increasing the aggregate commitment level to $1.5 billion and extending the
termination date by one year to July 2011. During September 2008, NiSource Finance entered into a
new $500 million six-month revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays
Capital that expires March 23, 2009. At December 31, 2008, NiSource had $1,163.5 million in
short-term borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities. Through the five-year revolver and
through other letter of credit facilities, NiSource has issued stand-by letters of credit of
approximately $87.3 million for the benefit of third parties. On February 13, 2009, the six-month
credit facility was terminated in conjunction with the closing of a new two-year term loan
facility.

Other Guarantees or Obligations.

On June 30, 2008, NiSource sold Whiting Clean Energy to BPAE for
$216.7 million which included $16.1 million in working capital. The agreement with BPAE contains
representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions. NiSource has executed purchase and
sales agreement guarantees totaling $220 million which guarantee performance of PEI’s covenants,
agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreement with BPAE.
No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008.

NiSource has additional purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $77.5 million, which
guarantee performance of the seller’s covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities,
representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales
agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that
the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses
associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote.

On August 29, 2007, Millennium entered into a bank credit agreement to finance the construction of
the Millennium pipeline project. As a condition precedent to the credit agreement, NiSource issued
a guarantee securing payment for 47.5%, its indirect ownership interest percentage, of amounts
borrowed under the credit agreement up until such time as the amounts payable under the agreement
are paid in full. As of December 31, 2008, Millennium borrowed $798.9 million under the financing
agreements, of which NiSource guaranteed $379.5 million. NiSource recorded an accrued liability of
approximately $7.6 million related to the fair value of this guarantee. The permanent financing
for Millennium is expected to be completed when debt capital market conditions improve. In the
interim, Millennium will continue to be funded by the $800 million credit agreement, which extends
through August 2010.

On June 29, 2006, Columbia Transmission, Piedmont, and Hardy Storage entered into multiple
agreements to finance the construction of the Hardy Storage project, which is accounted for by
NiSource as an equity investment. Under the financing agreement, Columbia Transmission issued
guarantees securing payment for 50% of any amounts issued in connection with Hardy Storage up until
such time as the project is placed in service and operated within certain specified parameters. As
of December 31, 2008, Hardy Storage borrowed $123.4 million under the financing agreement, for
which Columbia Transmission recorded an accrued liability of approximately $1.2 million related to
the fair value of its guarantee securing payment for $61.7 million which is 50% of the amount
borrowed.

NiSource has issued other guarantees supporting derivative related payments associated with
interest rate swap agreements issued by NiSource Finance, operating leases for many of its
subsidiaries and for other agreements entered into by its current and former subsidiaries.

B. Other Legal Proceedings.

In the normal course of its business, NiSource and its subsidiaries
have been named as defendants in various legal proceedings. In the opinion of management, the
ultimate disposition of these currently asserted claims will not have a material adverse impact on
NiSource’s consolidated financial position.

In the case of Tawney, et al. v. Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., the Plaintiffs, who are West
Virginia landowners, filed a lawsuit in early 2003 against CNR alleging that CNR underpaid
royalties on gas produced on their land by improperly deducting post-production costs and not
paying a fair value for the gas. In December 2004, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion to
add NiSource and Columbia as defendants. Plaintiffs also claimed that the defendants
fraudulently concealed the deduction of post-production charges. The court certified the case
as a class action that includes any person who, after July 31, 1990, received or is due
royalties from CNR (and its predecessors or successors) on lands lying within the boundary of
the state of West Virginia. All claims by the government of the United States are excluded
from the class. Although NiSource sold CNR in 2003, NiSource remains obligated to manage this
litigation and for the majority of any damages ultimately awarded to the plaintiffs. On
January 27, 2007, the jury hearing the case returned a verdict against all defendants in the
amount of $404.3 million; this is comprised of $134.3 million in compensatory damages and $270
million in punitive damages. In January 2008, the Defendants filed their petition for appeal,
and on March 24, 2008, the Defendants filed their amended petition for appeal with the West
Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. On May 22, 2008, the West Virginia Supreme Court of
Appeals refused the Defendants petition for appeal. On August 22, 2008, Defendants filed
their petitions to the United States Supreme Court for writ of certiorari. The Plaintiffs
filed their response on September 22, 2008. On September 19, 2008, the West Virginia Supreme
Court issued an order extending the stay of the judgment until proceedings before the United
States Supreme Court are fully concluded. Given the West Virginia Court’s refusal of the
appeal, NiSource adjusted its reserve in the second quarter of 2008 to reflect the portion of
the trial court judgment for which NiSource would be responsible, inclusive of interest. This
amount was included in “Legal and environmental reserves,” on the  Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008. On October 24, 2008, the West Virginia Circuit Court
for Roane County, West Virginia, preliminarily approved a settlement agreement with a total
settlement amount of $380 million. The settlement received final approval by the Court on
November 22, 2008. NiSource’s share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million.
NiSource has complied with its obligations under the settlement agreement to fund $85.5
million to the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. NiSource has also complied with
its obligation to provide a letter of credit on January 15, 2009, securing the unpaid portion
of the settlement and has submitted an agreed order discharging the judgment to the trial
court.

C. Tax Matters.

NiSource records liabilities for potential income tax assessments. The accruals
relate to tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on management’s estimate
of the ultimate resolution of these positions. These liabilities may be affected by changing
interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, or the expiration of the statute of
limitations. NiSource is a part of the IRS’s Large and Mid-Size Business program.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

As a result, each year’s federal income tax return is typically audited by the IRS. The audits of
all tax years through 2004 have been completed and are closed to further assessment. The IRS audit
of years 2005, 2006 and 2007 is scheduled to begin on March 31, 2009. The state of Texas completed
its audit of tax periods 2005 through 2007 in January 2009. The state of Mississippi began its
audit of tax years 2004 through 2007 in January 2009 and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has
notified the company it will begin its audit of tax year 2006 in June 2009. In addition, the state
of Indiana has notified NiSource it will begin an audit of tax years 2005, 2006 and 2007 in March
2009.

On January 12, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Columbia Transmission’s request for review in
Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. v. Levin, Ohio S. Ct., 117 Ohio St 3d 122. As a result, the Ohio
Supreme Court decision permitting the taxation of Columbia Transmission’s equipment at a higher
rate than that of a natural gas company stands. The Ohio Supreme Court had ruled that Columbia
Transmission was primarily engaged in the business of interstate transportation of natural gas and
was a pipeline company for purposes of taxing the company’s personal property, even though the
company also fell within the definition of a natural gas company by supplying natural gas for
lighting, power, or heating purposes to consumers within Ohio. All taxes subject to the appeal had
been paid under protest, so there is no adverse impact to NiSource’s financial statements from the
decision.

D. Environmental Matters.

General.

The operations of NiSource are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations intended to protect the public health and the environment. Such
environmental laws and regulations affect operations as they relate to impacts on air, water and
land.

Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United
States and worldwide to reduce so-called “greenhouse gases” such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of
burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage
in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently
a participant in the EPA’s Climate Leaders program. On April 2, 2007, in Massachusetts v. EPA, the
Supreme Court ruled that the EPA does have authority under the CAA to regulate emissions of
greenhouse gases if it is determined that greenhouse gases have a negative impact on human health
or the environment. On July 11, 2008, in response to the April 2, 2007, U.S. Supreme Court
decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, the EPA released an ANPR soliciting public input on the effects
of climate change and the potential ramifications of the CAA in relation to greenhouse gas
emissions. In the ANPR, the EPA presents and requests comment on the best-available science,
requests relevant data, and poses questions about the advantages and disadvantages of using the CAA
to potentially regulate stationary and mobile sources of greenhouse gases. The ANPR also reviews
various petitions, lawsuits and court deadlines before the agency, and the profound effect
regulating under the CAA could have on the economy. NiSource will continue to monitor and
participate in developments related to efforts to potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

The EPA is developing a mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule that would require reporting of
greenhouse gas emissions from large sources. The emission information collected would be used by
the EPA to develop comprehensive and accurate data relevant to future climate policy decisions,
including potential future regulation of greenhouse gases. The final reporting rule is scheduled
to be finalized by June 2009. NiSource will continue to monitor development of this rule.

Implementation of the ozone and fine particulate matter NAAQS may require imposition of additional
controls on boilers, engines and turbines. On April 15, 2004, the EPA finalized the eight-hour
ozone nonattainment area designations under the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS. After designation,
the CAA provides for a process for promulgation of rules specifying compliance level, compliance
deadline, and necessary controls to be implemented within designated areas over the next few years.
In addition, on March 12, 2008, the EPA announced the tightening of the eight-hour ozone NAAQS.
The number of areas that do not meet the new standard could significantly increase across the
country, thus requiring additional federal and state attainment planning and rulemaking. Resulting
federal and state rules could require additional reductions in NOx emissions from facilities owned
by electric generation and gas transmission and storage operations. On March 29, 2007, the EPA
signed a rule to govern implementation of the NAAQS for particulate matter (PM-2.5) that the EPA
promulgated in 1997. The rule addresses a wide range of issues, including state rulemaking
requirements as well as attainment demonstration requirements and deadlines. States must evaluate
potential reduction measures for the emission of particulate matter



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

and its precursors such as SO2 and NOx. The rule includes a conditional presumption that, for power
plants subject to the CAIR, compliance with CAIR would satisfy Reasonably Available Control
Measures and Reasonably Available Control Technology requirements for SO2 and NOx. States were
required to submit attainment SIPs in April 2008. Also, on September 21, 2006, the EPA issued
revisions to the NAAQS for particulate matter. The final rule increased the stringency of the
current fine particulate (PM2.5) standard, added a new standard for inhalable coarse particulate
(particulate matter between 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter), and revoked the annual PM10 standards
while retaining the 24-hour PM10 standards. The EPA rule designating areas not meeting the new
fine particulate matter standards was signed December 22, 2008 and expected to be effective in
April 2009. The SIPs detailing how states will reduce emissions to meet the NAAQS will be due
three years later in order to meet attainment by April 2014 with a possible five year extension to
April 2019. These actions could require further reductions in NOx emissions from various emission
sources in and near nonattainment areas, including reductions from Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in these matters and cannot
accurately estimate the timing or cost of emission controls at this time.

Gas Distribution Operations.

Several Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are potentially
responsible parties at waste disposal sites under the CERCLA (commonly known as Superfund) and
similar state laws, as well as at MGP sites, which such subsidiaries, or their corporate
predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries may be
required to share in the cost of cleanup of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution
Operations subsidiaries have responsibility for corrective action under the RCRA for closure and
cleanup costs associated with underground storage tanks and under the Toxic Substances Control Act
for cleanup of PCBs. The final costs of cleanup have not yet been determined. As site
investigations and cleanup proceed and as additional information becomes available reserves are
adjusted.

A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution
Operations subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has
identified up to 84 such sites and initial investigations have been conducted at 52 sites.
Additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 50 sites and remedial
measures have been implemented or completed at 30 sites. This effort includes the sites contained
in the January 2004 Indiana Voluntary Remediation Program agreements between the IDEM and Northern
Indiana, Kokomo Gas, and other Indiana utilities. Only those site investigation, characterization
and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered “probable and reasonably
estimable” under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be
adjusted. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental
expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to
accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects
that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts
become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the
entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the SEC’s SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5 and SOP
96-1. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, reserves of approximately $62.2 million and $61.3 million,
respectively, have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions for Gas
Distribution Operations.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations.

Columbia Transmission continues to conduct
characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA AOC. The 1995 AOC
covered 245 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury
measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization has been
performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be
submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion.
Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites,
storage well locations and all but 48 of the 245 facilities. The AOC was amended in 2007 to
facilitate payment of EPA oversight costs and to remove all but the remaining 48 facilities from
the AOC. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets for Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was approximately $3.2
million and $5.4 million, respectively.

Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are potentially responsible parties at several waste
disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws. The potential liability is believed to be de
minimis. However, the final allocation of cleanup costs has yet to be determined. As site
investigations and cleanups proceed and as additional information becomes available reserves will
be adjusted.

On February 21, 2007, PADEP provided representatives of Columbia Transmission with a proposed
Consent Order



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

and Agreement covering an unmanned equipment storage site located in rural southwest Pennsylvania.
PADEP’s proposed order alleges that Columbia Transmission has violated the state’s Clean Streams
Act and Solid Waste Management Act by discharging petroleum products onto the property and into the
waters of the state. In addition to requiring remediation and monitoring activities at the site,
the state has proposed penalties for these violations. The site was remediated via an EPA approved
Remedial Action Work Plan in the summer of 2008. The PADEP had provided written notification that
it would not attempt to stop the EPA approved work and would seek the aforementioned Order after
the remedy is completed. On January 6, 2009, PADEP provided Columbia Transmission with a Consent
Assessment of Civil Penalty seeking a civil penalty of $700 thousand for alleged violations of the
Clean Streams Law. Columbia Transmission is seeking clarification from the agency regarding the
proposed penalty.

During installation of the Millennium pipeline, petroleum hydrocarbon impacted soils and ground
water were encountered above State of New York standards at two locations on and adjacent to the
Columbia Transmission line A-5. These impacts were reported to the NYDEC. The State of New York
required that Columbia Transmission enter into stipulation Agreements with the NYDEC to address
remediation of the impacted media. Reserves have been established for initial response and cleanup
activities. Additional cleanup obligations may be identified after more information is available,
but costs to address the contamination are not expected to be material.

Electric Operations.

Air.

In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply
with the EPA’s NOx SIP call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to
reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional
transport of ozone. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules was required by May
31, 2004. To comply with the rule, Northern Indiana developed a NOx compliance plan, which
included the installation of Selective Catalytic Reduction and combustion control NOx reduction
technology at its active generating stations and is currently in compliance with the NOx
requirements. In implementing the NOx compliance plan, Northern Indiana has expended approximately
$315.7 million as of December 31, 2008.

Implementation of the fine particulate matter and ozone NAAQS has the potential to require
imposition of additional controls on coal-fired boilers. On April 15, 2004, the EPA finalized the
eight-hour ozone nonattainment area designations for the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS and designated
Lake, Porter, and LaPorte counties as nonattainment of the standard. This triggered a multi-year
process for development of rules specifying compliance level, compliance deadline, and necessary
controls to be implemented within nonattainment areas. Local ozone air quality improved in these
three counties, and LaPorte County was redesignated to attainment of the eight-hour ozone NAAQS
effective January 28, 2008. IDEM is also recommending Lake and Porter counties be redesignated to
attainment with the 1997 standard because of improved air quality during the most recent averaging
period. However, the March 12, 2008 EPA tightening of the eight-hour ozone NAAQS may result in
Lake, Porter and LaPorte counties again being designated as nonattainment of the new 2008 ozone
NAAQS. As discussed above under “General,” the EPA ozone NAAQS revision could lead to additional
emission reductions of NOx, an ozone precursor, from facilities owned by Northern Indiana.
Northern Indiana will closely monitor developments in these matters and cannot at this time
accurately estimate the timing or cost of emission controls that may eventually be required.

Also, in 2005 Lake and Porter counties were designated nonattainment for fine particulate matter.
Similar to ozone, local particulate matter air quality improved and IDEM submitted an attainment
SIP that is awaiting EPA approval. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor developments
in these matters and cannot predict the outcome or impact of the EPA action at this time.

On September 21, 2006, the EPA issued revisions to the NAAQS for particulate matter as described
above under, “General.” The EPA rule designating areas not meeting the new (2006) fine particulate
matter standards was signed December 22, 2008 and expected to be effective in April 2009. The SIPs
detailing how states will reduce emissions to meet the NAAQS in these areas will be due three years
later with attainment due by April 2014 and a possible five year extension to April 2019. The SIPs
developed to meet this standard could impact the emission control requirements for coal-fired
boilers including Northern Indiana’s electric generating stations. Northern Indiana will continue
to closely monitor developments in these matters and cannot accurately estimate the impact, timing
or cost of emission controls at this time.

On October 15, 2008, the EPA announced it is first strengthening of the NAAQS for lead in 30 years
by tightening the standards from the current 1.5 micrograms per cubic meter to 0.15 micrograms per
cubic meter and changing both the calculation method and averaging time. Also included are
provisions for the EPA to improve the existing lead monitoring network by requiring placement of
monitors in areas with industrial facilities that emit one or more tons per year of lead.
Designations of whether or not areas meet the standards are to be finalized by January 2012 with
the state plans for reducing emissions to meet the standards due in June 2013 and compliance by
January 2017. Northern Indiana is unable to predict the outcome of this EPA action at this time.

On March 10, 2005, the EPA issued the CAIR final regulations. The rule establishes phased
reductions of NOx and SO2 from 28 Eastern states, including electric utilities in Indiana, by
establishing an annual emissions cap for NOx and SO2 and an additional cap on NOx emissions during
the ozone control season. On March 15, 2006, the EPA signed three related rulemakings providing
final regulatory decisions on implementing the CAIR. The EPA, in one of the rulings, denied
several petitions for reconsideration of various aspects of the CAIR, including requests by
Northern Indiana to reconsider SO2 and NOx allocations. As an affected state, Indiana structured,
and preliminarily adopted in June 2006, a draft rule to meet the EPA abbreviated CAIR SIP
requirements and adopted the final rules on November 1, 2006. The CAIR rules became effective in
Indiana on February 25, 2007. In a petition filed with the IURC in December 2006, Northern Indiana
provided plans for the first phase of the emission control construction required to address the
Phase I CAIR requirements and a request for appropriate cost treatment and recovery. Northern
Indiana’s plan includes the upgrade of existing emission controls on three generating units for an
estimated cost of $45.4 million and anticipates that these expenses are recoverable. Northern
Indiana will continue to closely monitor developments in these matters and expects to install
additional emission controls for the second phase of CAIR, but cannot accurately estimate the
timing or cost of the emission controls at this time. On March 25, 2008, the U. S. Court of
Appeals for the D. C. Circuit held oral arguments in litigation challenging the CAIR.

On July 11, 2008, the court vacated the CAIR in its entirety, and remanded the rule back to the EPA
to develop a rule consistent with the court’s opinion. On September 24, 2008, four petitions were
submitted seeking rehearing by the original panel and the full panel (en banc). Among the
petitioners were the EPA as well as industry and environmental groups. On December 23, 2008, the
court decided to remand the CAIR without vacatur to EPA in order to remedy the CAIR’s flaws in
accordance with the court’s July 11, 2008 opinion in this case. Consequently, the federal CAIR
remains in effect. Northern Indiana will continue to monitor this matter and can not predict the
outcome or impact of EPA action at this time.

In anticipation of the issuance of the Court’s mandate to vacate CAIR upon the conclusion of legal
proceedings, on October 23, 2008, the IDEM took the initial step to develop a new state rule to
replace CAIR and obtain the emission reductions it would have achieved. As a result of the court’s
December 23, 2008 action, the Indiana CAIR remains in effect and the IDEM suspended its replacement
rulemaking activity. Northern Indiana will continue to monitor IDEM activity in this matter.

On October 3, 2007, the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board adopted, with minor changes from the
EPA CAMR, the state rule to implement EPA’s CAMR. The rule became effective on February 3, 2008,
with compliance required in 2010. On February 8, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit vacated two EPA rules addressing utility mercury emissions that are
the stimulus for the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board’s CAMR. The first is the EPA’s rule
delisting coal and oil-fired electric generating units from the list of sources whose emissions are
regulated under section 112 of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. § 7412.

Revision of December 2000 Regulatory
Finding

(“Delisting Rule”), 70 Fed. Reg. 15,994 (March 29, 2005). The second is the EPA’s rule
that set performance standards for new coal-fired electric generating units and established total
mercury emission limits for states along with a cap-and-trade program for new and existing
coal-fired electric generating units.

Standards of Performance for New and Existing Stationary
Sources: Electric Utility Steam Generating Units

(“CAMR”), 70 Fed. Reg. 28,606 (May 18, 2005). On
March 24, 2008, the EPA and industry filed petitions with the court for rehearing of these
decisions and on May 20, 2008, the D.C. Circuit denied the rehearing requests. Industry has filed
a petition for

certiorari

with the U. S. Supreme Court appealing the decision. The EPA sought and
received extensions of the appeal submittal deadline and filed their appeal on October 17, 2008.
On February 6, 2009, the Acting Solicitor General of the United States, on behalf of the EPA, filed
a motion to dismiss their challenge. The resolution of this legal action and the EPA’s response
will affect the implementation and timing of the installation of controls to address potential
mercury reduction obligations. Northern Indiana will closely

monitor developments regarding any further action by the EPA and subsequent regulatory developments
from the EPA and/or the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board in this matter.

The U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit, in late 2006, ruled a requirement to impose CAA
§185 fees on emissions sources located in counties that failed to timely attain the previous
(one-hour) ozone standard, (which had been rescinded by the EPA in May 2005) applicable retroactive
to November 2005. The court remanded the issue to the EPA for reconsideration. In January 2008,
the U. S. Supreme Court denied a petition to hear an appeal on this matter. Subsequently, the EPA
announced its intent to propose regulations in late 2008 to specify how CAA §185 fees will be
imposed and calculated. One of Northern Indiana’s operating generating assets is located in Porter
County where this fee could potentially be applied. On July 7, 2008, the EPA proposed a finding of
attainment of the one-hour ozone NAAQS for the Illinois and Indiana one-hour ozone nonattainment
area which includes Porter County. The Final Rule was published in the Federal Register on December
30, 2008. Included in the rule’s preamble is a statement confirming that Indiana is relieved from
the requirement to impose §185 penalty fees. Based on this rule and the IDEM’s renewed efforts to
redesignate Lake and Porter counties to attainment of the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard, Northern
Indiana believes that the CAA §185 penalty fees will not be applied to its facility and that this
matter is resolved.

On October 3, 2007, the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board adopted, with some minor modifications,
a rule to implement the EPA BART requirements for reduction of regional haze. The rule became
effective February 22, 2008, with compliance with any required BART controls within five years
(2013). The language of the final rule relies upon the provisions of the Indiana CAIR to meet
requirements for NOx and SO2 and does not impose any additional control requirements on coal-fired
generation emissions, including those of Northern Indiana. As part of the BART analysis process,
the IDEM evaluated the potential impact of particulate matter from electric generating units and
found no significant impacts on Class I areas.

In late 1999, the EPA initiated a New Source Review enforcement action against several industries,
including the electric utility industry, concerning rule interpretations that have been the subject
of recent (prospective) reform regulations. Northern Indiana has received and responded to the EPA
information requests on this subject, most recently in June 2002. The EPA issued an NOV to
Northern Indiana on September 29, 2004, for alleged violations of the CAA and the SIP.
Specifically, the NOV alleges that modifications were made to certain boiler units at the Michigan
City, Schahfer, and Bailly Generating Stations between the years of 1985 and 1995 without obtaining
appropriate air permits for the modifications. An adverse outcome in this matter could require
capital expenditures beyond the EPA requirements that cannot be determined at this time and could
require payment of substantial penalties.

Water.

The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative program added new water quality standards for
facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indiana’s three
electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its
regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. The NPDES
water discharge permit for Michigan City Generating Station has been issued and became effective on
April 1, 2006. Engineering studies have begun to determine specific compliance costs for this
facility. The permit for the Bailly Generating Station was issued on June 26, 2006, and became
effective on August 1, 2006. Northern Indiana appealed the Bailly Generating Station NPDES permit,
due to an unacceptable internal outfall monitoring permit condition. On February 18, 2008, the
Bailly Generating Station NPDES permit was modified to resolve the monitoring issue and to address
the 316(b) rule status due to the remand mentioned below.

On February 16, 2004, the EPA Administrator signed the Phase II Rule of the Clean Water Act Section
316(b) which requires all large existing steam electric generating stations meet certain
performance standards to reduce the effects on aquatic organisms at their cooling water intake
structures. The rule became effective on September 7, 2004. Under this rule, stations will either
have to demonstrate that the performance of their existing fish protection systems meet the new
standards or develop new systems, such as a closed-cycle cooling tower. On January 25, 2007, the
Second Circuit in a court decision on the Phase II 316(b) rule, remanded for EPA reconsideration
the options providing flexibility for meeting the requirements of the rule. On March 20, 2007, the
EPA issued a guidance memo advising its Regional Administrators that the Agency considers the
316(b), Phase II Rule governing cooling water withdrawals suspended. On July 5, 2007, the Second
Circuit Court of appeals denied the petitions for rehearing that had asked the court to reconsider
its remand of the Phase II 316(b) ruling. On July 9, 2007, the EPA



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

published a notice in the Federal Register suspending the Phase II rule. The notice explained that
the EPA is not accepting comments on the suspension and notes that “best professional judgment” is
to be used in making 316(b) decisions.

Various parties submitted petitions for a

writ of certiorari

to the U. S. Supreme Court in early
November 2007 seeking to reverse the Second Circuit Court’s decision. Several parties on both
sides of the issue filed

amicus curiae

briefs on the matter. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear
the appeal which is based on the role of cost-benefit analysis in establishing standards for
compliance with the rule. Oral arguments were conducted on December 2, 2008. The EPA may
eventually need to propose a revised 316(b) rule or provide guidance to address the impact of the
court decision. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor this activity and cannot
estimate the costs associated with the ultimate outcome at this time.

The IDEM issued a renewed NPDES Permit for Northern Indiana’s Michigan City Generating Station in
2006. The permit requires that the facility meet the Great Lakes Initiative discharge limits for
copper. The Michigan City Generating Station originally had a four year compliance schedule to
meet these limits, but on December 20, 2008, was granted a one year extension due to challenges
with meeting the new limit. The new date of compliance with the new copper limits ends on April
2011 with the expiration of the current NPDES permit. Northern Indiana currently is evaluating and
implementing various alternatives for treating copper in wastewater at the Michigan City Generating
Station.

Great Lakes Initiative-based discharge limits for mercury have also been set for both the Bailly
and the Michigan City Generating Stations. Northern Indiana will collect data, develop and
implement pollution reduction program plans, to demonstrate progress in reducing mercury discharge.
Streamlined Mercury Variance applications will be submitted for both stations in 2009.

Remediation.

Northern Indiana is a potentially responsible party under the CERCLA and similar
state laws at two waste disposal sites and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other
potentially responsible parties. At one site, the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study was
submitted to the EPA in 2007. The EPA issued a Record of Decision in 2008 to conduct additional
remedial activities at the site. At the second site, Northern Indiana has agreed to conduct a
Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study in the vicinity of the third party, state-permitted
landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. In addition, Northern Indiana has
corrective action liability under the RCRA for three facilities that historically stored hazardous
waste.

On March 31, 2005, the EPA and Northern Indiana entered into an AOC under the authority of Section
3008(h) of the RCRA for the Bailly Station. The order requires Northern Indiana to identify the
nature and extent of releases of hazardous waste and hazardous constituents from the facility.
Northern Indiana must also remediate any release of hazardous constituents that present an
unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. The process to complete investigation and
select appropriate remediation activities is ongoing. A reserve has been established to fund the
remedial measures proposed to EPA. The final costs of cleanup could change based on EPA review.

On September 13, 2006, IDEM advised Northern Indiana that further investigation of historic
releases from two previously removed underground storage tanks at the Schahfer Generating Station
would need to be investigated. Northern Indiana completed an investigation of potentially impacted
soils and groundwater and submitted results to the IDEM Leaking Underground Storage Tank section.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, reserves of approximately $3.8 million and $3.1 million,
respectively, have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions for Electric
Operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites cannot be estimated at this time
but could be significant.

Coal Combustion Products.

The Federal government continues to show interest in developing
regulations covering coal combustion waste products. Subsequent to the December 22, 2008 dike
collapse at a Tennessee Valley Authority ash pond, congressional hearings were held on the issue.
Legislation regulating coal ash pursuant to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act was
introduced and the EPA is reviewing its previous determination that federal regulation of coal ash
is not appropriate. Northern Indiana will monitor future regulatory actions and cannot predict the
potential financial impact at this time.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Other Operations.

NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liabilities, including cleanup
liabilities associated with some of its former propane operations, petroleum operations, and CER.
Four MGP sites are associated with former propane operations. Investigations have been completed
at three of the sites and remediation has been conducted at two of the sites. There are also ten
sites associated with former petroleum operations. At one of those sites, an AOC has been signed
with EPA to address petroleum residue in soil and groundwater. NiSource is one of multiple PRPs
responsible for liabilities being addressed by that AOC.

The ultimate liability in connection with these contamination sites will depend upon many factors
including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible
parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only
those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered “probable and
reasonably estimable” under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96-1. As costs become probable and
reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any
environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable,
will not have a material adverse effect on NiSource’s financial position.

Environmental Reserves.

It is management’s continued intent to address environmental issues in
cooperation with regulatory authorities in such a manner as to achieve mutually acceptable
compliance plans. However, there can be no assurance that fines and penalties will not be
incurred. Management expects a significant portion of environmental assessment and remediation
costs to be recoverable through rates for certain NiSource companies.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, reserves of approximately $73.1 million and $75.0 million,
respectively, have been recorded to cover probable corrective actions at sites where NiSource has
environmental remediation liability. Regulatory assets have been recorded to the extent
environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered in rates. NiSource accrues for costs
associated with environmental remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs is probable
and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, regardless of when the expenditures are actually made.
The undiscounted estimated future expenditures are based on many factors including currently
enacted laws and regulations, existing technology and estimated site-specific costs whereby
assumptions may be made about the nature and extent of site contamination, the extent of cleanup
efforts, costs of alternative cleanup methods and other variables. NiSource’s estimated
environmental remediation liability will be refined as events in the remediation process occur.
Actual remediation costs may differ materially from NiSource’s estimates due to the dependence on
the factors listed above.

E. Operating and Capital Lease Commitments.

NiSource leases assets in several areas of its
operations. Payments made in connection with operating leases were $56.2 million in 2008, $53.4
million in 2007 and $58.4 million in 2006, and are primarily charged to operation and maintenance
expense as incurred. Capital leases and related accumulated depreciation included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1.4 million and $0.3 million at December 31, 2008, and $2.6
million and $1.1 million at December 31, 2007, respectively.

NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline
business software requiring equal annual payments of $5.8 million over 10 years beginning in
January 2008. This agreement is recorded as a capital lease. Final acceptance of the software
installation was made on January 2, 2008 and the software was placed in service in September 2008.

Future minimum rental payments required under operating and capital leases that have initial or
remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year are:

F. Purchase and Service Obligations.

NiSource has entered into various purchase and service
agreements whereby NiSource is contractually obligated to make certain minimum payments in future
periods. NiSource’s purchase obligations are for the purchase of physical quantities of natural
gas, electricity and coal. NiSource’s service agreements encompass a broad range of business
support and maintenance functions which are generally described below.

NiSource’s subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical
quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent minimum quantities of
these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices.

In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indiana’s proposed purchase power
agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC.
These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw
of wind power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw
of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the
variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are
included in the table below. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any
reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern
Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events
giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination.

NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and
storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2009 to 2045, require
NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges.

On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide
business process and support functions to NiSource. During 2008, NiSource reassumed responsibility
for certain support functions including human resource administration, payroll, supply chain
(procurement), sales centers, and the majority of meter to cash operations (billing and
collections) while customer contact center operations and accounts payable functions were
transitioned to different service providers. IBM has retained responsibility for information
technology operations. NiSource Corporate Services will continue to pay IBM for the amended
services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating
based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services,
NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $618 million to IBM in service fees and
project costs over the remaining 6.5 year term, of which $3.7 million is reflected as capital lease
payment. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material
breach by IBM), NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a
breakage fee, repayment of IBM’s un-recovered capital investments, and IBM wind-down expense. This
termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and
the timing of the termination.

NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business
process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries
through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate
Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable
charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage
of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $76.0 million to Vertex
Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining 6.5 year term. Upon termination of the
agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC),
NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $15.0 million.

Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation
services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various
periods through 2013.

Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products
and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under
this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a
combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides

that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be
due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty-year contract
period.

23. Segments of Business

Under provisions of SFAS No. 131, operating segments are components of an enterprise for which
separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating
decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource
Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker.

NiSource’s operations are divided into four primary business segments. The Gas Distribution
Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and
industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and
Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and
storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in
northeastern, mid-Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The
Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of
Indiana. The Other Operations segment primarily includes gas marketing, and ventures focused on
distributed power generation technologies, including fuel cells and storage systems.

The following table provides information about business segments. NiSource uses operating income
as its primary measurement for each of the reported segments and makes decisions on finance,
dividends and taxes at the corporate level on a consolidated basis. Segment revenues include
intersegment sales to affiliated subsidiaries, which are eliminated in consolidation. Affiliated
sales are recognized on the basis of prevailing market, regulated prices or at levels provided for
under contractual agreements. Operating income is derived from revenues and expenses directly
associated with each segment. Gas Distribution, Gas Transmission and Storage, Electric, Other
Operations, and Corporate operating income was positively impacted by $6.7 million, $3.3 million,
$8.4 million, $0.1 million, and $0.6 million, respectively, for adjustments to medical expenses
during the third quarter 2008 due to a misclassification of certain claims in prior periods. This
adjustment had no impact on actual medical claims paid and was not material to the results of
operations and consolidated financial statements. Electric Operations operating income was
negatively impacted by an $8.3 million depreciation expense adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana
during the second quarter of 2008. The non-cash adjustment to depreciation expense was not
material to the results of operations and consolidated financial statements and will not materially
impact depreciation charges in future periods.

24. Hurricanes and Other Items

NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $46.7 million, $17.4 million, and $10.6
million related to hurricanes and other items in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, which are
separately included in the investing activities section on the Statement of Consolidated Cash
Flows.

Hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, and Rita

In September 2004, hurricane Ivan damaged certain Columbia Gulf property and in the third quarter
of 2005, Columbia Gulf incurred additional damages to its pipeline assets and facilities as a
result of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Total costs recorded to repair damages in 2008, 2007, and
2006 were $7.4 million, $12.1 million and $42.3 million, respectively.

Columbia Gulf is covered by insurance for these damages, subject to a $1.0 million deductible per
incident. Insurance covers capital repairs, operating and maintenance expenses, and business
interruption. Insurance claims were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million that included $1.0
million in business interruption. For the year ended December 31, 2008, Columbia Gulf received
$16.8 million of insurance proceeds. Amounts received of $13.4 million were for capital repairs
and $3.4 million for operating and maintenance expenses.

In 2007 and 2006, Columbia Gulf had received $8.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in
insurance recoveries, net of deductibles, related to these damages under its insurance policies.
Amounts received for capital repairs totaled $3.8 million and $1.8 million and for operating and
maintenance expenses totaled $4.7 million and $2.2

million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Columbia Transmission received insurance proceeds in 2006
for hurricane Ivan of $0.5 million for capital repairs and $0.7 million for operating and
maintenance expenses. Costs to repair damages are recognized when costs are incurred or as
information becomes available to estimate the damages incurred.

As of December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, Columbia Gulf had a receivable of $14.1 million, $43.4
million, and $39.8 million related to the hurricanes. Amounts recoverable through insurance are
recorded within Accounts Receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Line 100 Rupture

On December 14, 2007, Columbia Gulf’s Line 100 ruptured approximately two miles north of its Delhi
Compressor Station in Louisiana. The damage to the pipeline forced Columbia Gulf to declare force
majeure because no gas was flowing through this portion of the pipeline system on Lines 100, 200
and 300 while a facility assessment was performed. One day later, Lines 200 and 300 were returned
to service and gas flow was restored on December 16, 2007. On December 19, 2007, the DOT issued a
Corrective Action Order. The Order required Columbia Gulf to develop a remedial work plan to
restore Line 100 pipeline’s pressure and capacity. Between December 22, 2007 and June 30, 2008,
the Line 100 pipeline operated at less than full pressure and full capacity. On July 1, 2008,
Columbia Gulf received permission from the DOT to restore full pressure and full capacity on the
Line 100 pipeline. Columbia Gulf continues to operate under this Order.

Costs of $2.9 million to repair damages on Line 100 were recognized when they were incurred
predominantly in 2008. After a $1.0 million deductible, insurance settlements totaled $1.8
million, of which $1.5 million was received in 2008. Amounts received for capital repairs totaled
$1.3 million and $0.2 million for operating and maintenance expenses. As of December 31, 2008,
Columbia Gulf had an insurance receivable of $0.3 million related to the damages. The business
interruption insurance claim is expected to be resolved in the first quarter 2009.

Engine Failure

On May 26, 2005, Columbia Gulf experienced a catastrophic engine failure at the company’s Delhi,
Louisiana, Compressor Station. Delhi is the third compressor station on Columbia Gulf’s 845-mile
long mainline that stretches from near Lafayette, La., to the Kentucky/West Virginia state line,
bringing natural gas from offshore and onshore Louisiana to markets throughout the eastern United
States. The station was repaired and placed back into full service on January 15, 2007. Costs
incurred to repair the compressor station totaled $3.1 million in 2005, $24.7 million in 2006, and
$1.7 million in 2007. Insurance settlements, after a $1.0 million deductible, totaled $13.8
million in 2007, which included $4.0 million for business interruption and $10.2 million in 2006,
which included $1.9 million for business interruption.

Tornado

On February 5, 2008, a tornado struck Columbia Gulf’s Hartsville Compressor Station in Macon
County, Tennessee. The damage to the facility forced Columbia Gulf to declare force majeure
because no gas was flowing through this portion of the pipeline system while a facility assessment
was being performed and the current contractual transportation agreements of 2.156 Bcf per day
could not be met. Since that time, Columbia Gulf has constructed both temporary and permanent
facilities at Hartsville. On July 19, 2008, the station completed the installation of temporary hp
and restored capacity to flow up to 2.156 Bcf per day. During the next 12 to 14 months, the
temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities will be replaced with a
permanent solution.

NiSource expects to incur an additional $30.2 million in reconstruction costs for the compressor
station and ancillary facilities in addition to the $47.0 million in costs incurred in 2008. Damage
claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008 for a total of $77.5 million, of which $30.1
million was received in the current year after a $1.0 million deductible. Amounts received were all
attributable to capital repairs. As of December 31, 2008, Columbia Gulf had an insurance receivable
of $47.4 million related to the damages, which includes $1.7 million for business interruption and
gas lost.

27. Subsequent Events

During January 2009, NiSource repurchased $32.4 million of the $450.0 million floating rate notes
scheduled to mature in November 2009 and $67.6 million of the $1.0 billion 7.88% unsecured notes
scheduled to mature in November 2010.

During February 2009, NiSource negotiated a two-year term loan facility with a syndicate of banks
maturing in February 2011. Borrowings under the facility will have an effective cost of LIBOR plus
538 basis points. The initial closing of the facility occurred on February 13, 2009, with a
subsequent closing expected to take place in early April under an “accordion” feature under which
the facility can be expanded to $500 million prior to the final closing. NiSource has received
bank commitments totaling $265 million, with the ultimate level of the facility expected to be up
to $350 million. In addition, NiSource is working toward issuing up to an aggregate of $350
million of secured and unsecured debt at several of its subsidiary companies during 2009.

On
February 27, 2009, NiSource announced an organizational restructuring
of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. NiSource will
be eliminating approximately 370 to 380 positions across the 16 state
operating territory of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. The
reductions will occur through normal attrition as well as through
voluntary programs and involuntary separations. In addition to the
employee reductions, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations will
take steps to achieve additional cost savings by efficiently managing
its various business locations, reducing its fleet operations,
creating alliances with third party service providers, and
implementing other changes in line with its strategic plan for growth
and in response to current economic conditions. The new structure
will allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations to operate safely
and reliably while serving customers in a more effective and cost
efficient manner. NiSource expects to incur pre-tax restructuring
charges of approximately $25 million to $30 million, which primarily
includes costs related to severance and other employee related costs.
The majority of these charges will be incurred during the first
quarter of 2009.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

NiSource’s chief executive officer and its principal financial officer, after evaluating the
effectiveness of NiSource’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)), have concluded based on the evaluation required by paragraph (b) of
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 that, as of the end of the period covered by this report,
NiSource’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that
financial information was processed, recorded and reported accurately.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

NiSource management, including NiSource’s principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, are responsible for establishing and maintaining NiSource’s internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. However, management would note that a control system can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
NiSource’s management has adopted the framework set forth in the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission report, Internal Control — Integrated Framework, the most
commonly used and understood framework for evaluating internal control over financial reporting, as
its framework for evaluating the reliability and effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. During 2008, NiSource conducted an evaluation of its internal control over financial
reporting. Based on this evaluation, NiSource management concluded that NiSource’s internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual
report.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, NiSource’s independent registered public accounting firm, issued an
attestation report on NiSource’s internal controls over financial reporting which is contained in
Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Changes in Internal Controls

During the first quarter of 2008, management designed and implemented internal controls to ensure
the adequate calculation and recording of Northern Indiana’s unbilled revenues. Management tested
the operating effectiveness of these controls during the second, third and fourth quarters, and
found them to be effective in preventing a material error.

Other than the internal control changes referenced above, there have been no other changes in
NiSource’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year covered by this report
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, NiSource’s internal control over
financial reporting.
