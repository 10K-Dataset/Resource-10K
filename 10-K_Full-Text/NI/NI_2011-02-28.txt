ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

NiSource Inc.

NiSource is an energy holding company whose subsidiaries provide natural gas, electricity and other
products and services to approximately 3.8 million customers located within a corridor that runs
from the Gulf Coast through the Midwest to New England. NiSource is the successor to an Indiana
corporation organized in 1987 under the name of NIPSCO Industries, Inc., which changed its name to
NiSource on April 14, 1999.

NiSource is one of the nation’s largest natural gas distribution companies, as measured by number
of customers. NiSource’s principal subsidiaries include Columbia, a vertically-integrated natural
gas distribution, transmission and storage holding company whose subsidiaries provide service to
customers in the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast; Northern Indiana, a
vertically-integrated gas and electric company providing service to customers in northern Indiana;
and Columbia of Massachusetts, a natural gas distribution company serving customers in
Massachusetts. NiSource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating
results of its fifteen direct subsidiaries.

NiSource’s business segments are: Gas Distribution Operations; Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations; and Electric Operations. Following is a summary of the business for each reporting
segment. Refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations”, for additional information for each segment.

Gas Distribution Operations

NiSource’s natural gas distribution operations serve more than 3.3 million customers in seven
states and operate approximately 59 thousand miles of pipeline. Through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Columbia, NiSource owns five distribution subsidiaries that provide natural gas to
approximately 2.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Virginia, Kentucky, and Maryland. NiSource also distributes natural gas to approximately 795
thousand customers in northern Indiana through three subsidiaries: Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas
and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Additionally, NiSource’s subsidiary, Columbia Gas of
Massachusetts, distributes natural gas to approximately 296 thousand customers in Massachusetts.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations

NiSource’s Gas Transmission and Storage Operations subsidiaries own and operate nearly 15,000 miles
of jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional pipelines and operate one of the nation’s largest
underground natural gas storage systems capable of storing approximately 639 Bcf of natural gas.
Through its subsidiaries, Columbia Transmission, Columbia Gulf and Crossroads Pipeline, NiSource
owns and operates an interstate pipeline network extending from the Gulf of Mexico to New York and
the eastern seaboard. Together, these companies serve customers in 16 northeastern, mid-Atlantic,
midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia.

NiSource’s Gas Transmission and Storage Operations continue to capture growth opportunities
leveraging NiSource’s strategically positioned pipeline and storage assets. A number of Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations’ new growth projects are designed to support increasing
Marcellus Shale production, while the Company also has continued to grow and adapt its system to
provide critical transportation and storage services to markets across its high-demand service
territory.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations subsidiaries are also involved in two joint ventures,
Millennium and Hardy Storage, which effectively expand their facilities and throughput. Millennium
pipeline, which includes 247 miles of 30-inch-diameter pipe across New York’s Southern Tier and
lower Hudson Valley, has the capability to transport up to 525,400 Dth per day of natural gas to
markets along its route, as well as to the New York City markets through its pipeline
interconnections. Millennium is jointly owned by affiliates of NiSource, DTE Energy and National
Grid. Hardy Storage, which consists of underground natural gas storage facilities in West Virginia,
has a working storage capacity of 12 Bcf and the ability to deliver 176,000 Dth of natural gas per
day. Hardy Storage is a joint venture of subsidiaries of Columbia Transmission and Piedmont.

Electric Operations

NiSource generates, transmits and distributes electricity through its subsidiary Northern Indiana
to approximately 458 thousand customers in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana and engages
in wholesale and transmission transactions. Northern Indiana operates three coal-fired electric
generating stations. The three operating facilities have a net capability of 2,574 mw. Northern
Indiana also owns and operates Sugar Creek, a CCGT plant with a 535


ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

NiSource Inc.

mw capacity rating, four gas-fired generating units located at Northern Indiana’s coal-fired
electric generating stations with a net capability of 203 mw and two hydroelectric generating
plants with a net capability of 10 mw. These facilities provide for a total system operating net
capability of 3,322 mw. Sugar Creek was purchased in May 2008 and dispatched into MISO on December
1, 2008. Northern Indiana’s transmission system, with voltages from 69,000 to 345,000 volts,
consists of 2,795 circuit miles. Northern Indiana is interconnected with five neighboring electric
utilities.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, Northern Indiana generated 86.7% and purchased 13.3% of
its electric requirements. Northern Indiana’s Mitchell Station, indefinitely shut down in 2002, is
not included in the net capacity of the three coal-fired generation stations. In the order
received on May 25, 2010 related to the 2008 rate case, the IURC approved a rate base that excludes
the Mitchell Station. All utility plant assets of the Mitchell Station in service were retired and
CWIP, materials and supplies, and base coal totaling $4.3 million were expensed during the third
quarter of 2010 as there were no future economic benefits associated with these assets.

Northern Indiana participates in the MISO transmission service and wholesale energy market. The
MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC regulations, to improve the flow
of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Additionally, MISO
is responsible for managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, managing the
day-ahead, real-time and FTR markets and managing the ancillary market. Northern Indiana
transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO and transmission service
for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff.

Corporate and Other Operations

During the first quarter of 2010, NiSource made the decision to wind down the unregulated natural
gas marketing activities as a part of the Company’s long-term strategy of focusing on its core
regulated business.

Divestiture of Non-Core Assets

In recent years, NiSource sold certain businesses judged to be non-core to NiSource’s strategy.
NiSource sold Whiting Clean Energy to BPAE in April 2008 for $216.7 million which included $16.1
million in working capital. In December 2008, NiSource sold Northern Utilities and Granite State
Gas for $209.1 million which included $49.1 million in working capital. Columbia Gulf sold a
portion of Columbia Gulf’s offshore assets to Tennessee Gas Pipeline in June 2008. Lake Erie Land,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of NiSource, sold its Sand Creek Golf Club assets in June 2006, to a
private real estate developer. Lake Erie Land is pursuing the sale of certain other real estate
assets it owns. NiSource Corporate Services is continuing to work with potential buyers to sell
its Marble Cliff facility. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource Corporate Services executed a
purchase and sale agreement of the Marble Cliff facility with the closing date planned in the first
quarter 2011. NDC Douglas Properties, a subsidiary of NiSource Development Company, is in the
process of exiting some of its low income housing investments.

Business Strategy

NiSource focuses its business strategy on its core, rate-regulated asset-based businesses with
virtually 100% of its operating income generated from the rate-regulated businesses. With the
nation’s fourth largest natural gas pipeline, the largest natural gas distribution network east of
the Rocky Mountains and one of the nation’s largest natural gas storage networks, NiSource operates
throughout the energy-intensive corridor that extends from the supply areas in the Gulf Coast
through the consumption centers in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, New England and Northeast. This
corridor includes over 40% of the nation’s population and close to 50% of its natural gas
consumption. NiSource continues to position its assets to meet the corridor’s growing energy
needs.

Competition and Changes in the Regulatory Environment

The regulatory frameworks applicable to NiSource’s operations, at both the state and federal
levels, continue to evolve. These changes have had and will continue to have an impact on
NiSource’s operations, structure and profitability. Management continually seeks new ways to be
more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including providing gas customers
with increased choices for products and services.

Natural Gas Competition

. Open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the
deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets. LDC

BUSINESS

NiSource Inc.

purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open, competitive market for gas supplies
has emerged. This separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and other services offered by
pipelines and LDCs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by
the pipelines and LDCs. The LDCs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from
their customers. NiSource’s Gas Distribution Operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs
that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third
parties and use the NiSource Gas Distribution Operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services.

Electric Competition

. Northern Indiana currently dispatches all power from its plants into the
MISO. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission
Tariff.

Financing Subsidiary

NiSource Finance is a wholly-owned, consolidated finance subsidiary of NiSource that engages in
financing activities to raise funds for the business operations of NiSource and its subsidiaries.
NiSource Finance was incorporated in February 2000 under the laws of the state of Indiana.
NiSource Finance’s obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NiSource.

Other Relevant Business Information

NiSource’s customer base is broadly diversified, with no single customer accounting for a
significant portion of revenues.

As of
December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective
bargaining agreements.

For a listing of certain subsidiaries of NiSource refer to Exhibit 21.

NiSource files various reports with the SEC. The reports include the annual report on Form 10-K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and amendments to
those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. NiSource makes all SEC filings available without charge to the public on its web site at

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

NiSource Inc.

There are many factors that could have a material adverse effect on NiSource’s operating results,
financial condition and cash flows. New risks may emerge at any time, and NiSource cannot predict
those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance. Each of the
risks described below could adversely impact the value of NiSource’s securities.

NiSource has substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial condition.

NiSource had total consolidated indebtedness of $7,352.8 million outstanding as of December 31,
2010. The substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors. For example,
it could:

Some of NiSource’s debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debt-to-capital ratios
and cross-default provisions. NiSource’s failure to comply with any of these covenants could
result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of
outstanding debt obligations. Additionally, a drop in NiSource’s credit rating could adversely
impact the cost for NiSource to issue new debt securities.

A drop in NiSource’s credit rating could adversely impact NiSource’s liquidity.

On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB-, and the
existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitch’s outlook for NiSource and all of its
subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moody’s Investors Service affirmed the senior
unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries.
Moody’s outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is
stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard
& Poor’s affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB-. Standard
& Poor’s outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue
to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s or Fitch would result in a rating
that is below investment grade.

Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased
collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB- by
Standard & Poor’s or Baa3 by Moody’s. The additional collateral that would be required in the
event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $18.1 million.
In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain “adequate
assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support
such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. In addition, under Northern
Indiana’s trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indiana’s
debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s, or falls below BB or Ba2 at either
Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohio’s and Columbia of
Pennsylvania’s trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSource’s debt
rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s, or falls below BB- or Ba3 at either
Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s, respectively.

Additionally, as a result of NiSource’s participation in certain derivative activities, a credit
downgrade could cause NiSource to be required to post substantial collateral in support of past and
current transactions. These collateral requirements, combined with other potential negative effects
on NiSource’s liquidity in the event of a credit downgrade below an investment grade rating, could
have a material adverse effect on earnings potential and cash


ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

NiSource Inc.

flows. Lastly, a credit downgrade could adversely affect the availability and cost of capital
needed to fund the growth investments which are a central element of the company’s long-term
business strategy.

NiSource may not be able to execute its growth strategy as planned.

Because of changes in the business or regulatory environment, NiSource may not be able to execute
its four-part business plan as intended. NiSource’s commercial and regulatory initiatives may not
achieve planned results; levels of commercial growth and expansion of the gas transmission and
storage business may be less than its plan has anticipated; and the actual results of NiSource’s
financial management of the balance sheet, and process and expense management could deviate
materially from planned outcomes.

Adverse economic and market conditions or increases in interest rates could reduce net revenue
growth, increase costs, decrease future net income and cash flows and impact capital resources and
liquidity needs.

While the national economy is experiencing some recovery from the recent downturn, NiSource cannot
predict how robust the recovery will be or whether or not it will be sustained.

Continued sluggishness in the economy impacting NiSource’s operating jurisdictions could adversely
impact NiSource’s ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers, which
could reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs. An increase in the interest rates
NiSource pays would adversely affect future net income and cash flows. In addition, NiSource
depends on debt to finance its operations, including both working capital and capital expenditures,
and would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates. The slow rate of the current
economic recovery and tightened credit markets, coupled with NiSource’s credit ratings, could
impact NiSource’s ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt at a reasonable cost.
Refer to Note 16, “Long-Term Debt,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
information related to outstanding long-term debt and maturities of that debt.

Capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which
then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings.

The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to
satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
NiSource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts.
These assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns, which fall below
NiSource’s projected rates of return. A decline in the market value of assets may increase the
funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement
benefit plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit
plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, which could potentially increase
funding requirements. Further, the funding requirements of the obligations related to these
benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant
demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions.
Ultimately, significant funding requirements and increased pension expense could negatively impact
NiSource’s results of operations and financial position.

The majority of NiSource’s net revenues is subject to economic regulation and is exposed to the
impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings.

Virtually all of NiSource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal
or state level. As such, the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to
regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority. These rate reviews determine the
energy rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues. NiSource’s financial results are
dependent on more frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs. For
example, the outcome of the currently pending 2010 electric rate case could have a material effect
on NiSource’s financial results. Additionally, the costs of complying with future changes in
environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant, and their recovery through rates
will be contingent on regulatory approval.

As a result of efforts to introduce market-based competition in certain of the markets where the
regulated businesses conduct operations, NiSource may compete with independent marketers for
customers. This competition exposes NiSource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be
recoverable and may affect results of NiSource’s growth strategy and cash flows.

NiSource’s costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant. The costs of compliance
with future environmental laws and the recognition of environmental liabilities could impact cash
flow and profitability.

NiSource’s subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental
requirements that, among other things, regulate air emissions, water usage and discharges,
remediation and the management of chemicals, hazardous waste, solid waste, and coal combustion
residuals. Compliance with these legal obligations requires NiSource to make expenditures for
installation of pollution control equipment, remediation, environmental monitoring, emissions fees
and permits at many of NiSource’s facilities. These expenditures are significant, and NiSource
expects that they will continue to be significant in the future. Furthermore, if NiSource’s
subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to the
environment or persons, even if caused by factors beyond NiSource’s control, that failure or harm
may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against NiSource and its
subsidiaries.


ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

NiSource Inc.

Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to
protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to NiSource’s subsidiaries. Revised or
additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating
restrictions on NiSource’s facilities or increased compliance costs, which may not be fully
recoverable from customers and would, therefore, reduce net income. Moreover, such costs could
materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of NiSource’s facilities.

Because NiSource operations deal with natural gas and coal fossil fuels, emissions of GHGs are an
expected aspect of the business. While NiSource attempts to reduce GHG emissions through
efficiency programs, leak detection, and other programs, GHG emissions cannot be entirely
eliminated. The current administration has made it clear that they are focused on
reducing GHG emissions, through legislation and/or regulation. Imposing statutory or regulatory
restrictions and/or costs on GHG emissions could increase NiSource’s cost of producing energy,
which could impact customer demand or NiSource’s profitability. Compliance costs associated with
these requirements could also affect NiSource’s cash flow. The cost impact of any new or amended
GHG legislation or regulations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be
determined at this time.

Even in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known, the original estimates
for cleanup and environmental capital projects can differ materially from the amount ultimately
expended. The actual future expenditures depend on many factors, including the nature and extent of
contamination, the method of cleanup, the cost of raw materials, contractor costs, and the
availability of cost recovery from customers. Changes in costs could affect NiSource’s financial
position and cash flows.

A significant portion of the gas and electricity NiSource sells is used by residential and
commercial customers for heating and air conditioning. Accordingly, the operating results
fluctuate depending on the weather and, to a certain extent, usage of gas or electricity.

Energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather. Forecasts of energy sales are based on normal
weather, which represents a long-term historical average. Significant variations from normal
weather could have, and have had, a material impact on energy sales. Additionally, residential
usage, and to some degree commercial usage, have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity
costs for gas and electricity, whereby usage declines with increased costs, thus affecting
NiSource’s financial results. Lastly, residential and commercial customers’ usage has shown to be
sensitive to economic conditions and the impact of macro-economic drivers such as unemployment,
consumption and consumer confidence, which could also affect NiSource’s financial results.

NiSource’s business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries.

Business operations throughout NiSource’s service territories have been and may continue to be
adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where it operates. In
particular, sales to large industrial customers may be impacted by economic downturns. The U.S.
manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international
competition, increasing costs, and fluctuating demand for their products.


ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

NiSource Inc.

Fluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs may have a
negative impact on NiSource’s financial results.

NiSource’s electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel, and its gas
distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas they deliver. These energy
commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation
costs. Hedging activities have been deployed in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply
prices and NiSource relies on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order
to fully recover the costs incurred in operations. However, while NiSource has historically been
successful in recovery of costs related to such commodity prices, there can be no assurance that
such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner. Additionally, increased gas
and electricity costs could result in reduced demand from customers as a result of increased
conservation activities.

NiSource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services,
and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating
agreements.

NiSource’s extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy, involves considerable
judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition, credit
history and other factors. Credit risk exposure is monitored by obtaining credit reports and
updated financial information for customers and suppliers, and by evaluating the financial status
of its banking partners and other counterparties through the use of market-based metrics such as
credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the
major credit rating agencies. Continued adverse economic conditions could increase credit risk and
could result in a material adverse effect on NiSource.

NiSource has significant goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets. An impairment of goodwill
or definite-lived intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earnings.

In accordance with GAAP, NiSource tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and reviews its
definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill would also be tested for impairment when
factors, examples of which include, reduced cash flow estimates, a sustained decline in stock price
or market capitalization below book value, indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
NiSource would be required to record a charge in the financial statements during the period in
which any impairment of the goodwill or definite-lived intangible assets is determined, negatively
impacting the results of operations. A significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio
covenant under the five-year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to
maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in the 2005
private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization
ratio that does not exceed 75%.

Changes in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes could adversely affect NiSource’s
financial results.

NiSource is subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal, state and local
levels where it does business. Legislation or regulation which could affect NiSource’s tax burden
could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities. NiSource cannot predict the timing or
extent of such tax-related developments which could have a negative impact on the financial
results. Additionally, NiSource uses its best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for
these tax obligations. However, a challenge by a taxing authority, NiSource’s ability to utilize
tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits, or a deviation from other tax-related
assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates.


ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

NiSource Inc.

Changes in accounting principles may adversely affect NiSource’s financial results.

Future changes in accounting rules, such as IFRS, and associated changes in regulatory accounting
may negatively impact the way NiSource records revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These
changes in accounting standards may adversely affect its financial results.

Transporting and storing natural gas involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.

Our gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks,
such as leaks,  accidents, including third party damages, and mechanical problems, which could cause substantial
financial losses. In addition, these risks could result in serious injury to employees and non-employees, loss of
human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and impairment of our operations, which in turn
could lead to substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against
some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas,
including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages
resulting from these risks. The occurrence of  any of these events not fully covered by insurance could adversely
affect our financial position and results of operations.

Aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively
impact NiSource’s financial results.

NiSource has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets. The age of these assets may result
in a higher level of maintenance costs and may be susceptible to unscheduled outages despite
diligent efforts by NiSource to properly maintain these assets through inspection, scheduled
maintenance and capital investment. The failure to operate these assets as desired could result in
NiSource’s inability to meet firm service obligations, adversely impact revenues, and could result
in increased expenses, which may not be fully recoverable from customers.

Climate change, natural disasters, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events may disrupt
operations and reduce the ability to service customers.

A disruption or failure of natural gas transmission, storage or distribution systems or within
electric generation, transmission or distribution systems in the event of a major hurricane,
tornado, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales,
providing services, or performing other critical functions. NiSource has experienced disruptions
in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature. The cost, availability
and sufficiency of insurance for these risks could adversely affect NiSource’s results of
operations, financial position and cash flows.

There is also a concern that climate change may exacerbate the risks to physical infrastructure
associated with heat and extreme weather conditions. Climate change and the costs that may be
associated with its impacts have the potential to affect NiSource’s business in many ways,
including increasing the cost NiSource incurs in providing its products and services, impacting the
demand for and consumption of its products and services (due to change in both costs and weather
patterns), and affecting the economic health of the regions in which NiSource operates.

Growing NiSource’s business by constructing new pipelines and other facilities subjects NiSource to
construction risks and natural gas supply risks.

NiSource Gas Transmission & Storage Operations continues to complete and advance customer-driven
growth projects across its system, primarily surrounding the Marcellus Shale production area in the
states of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. These growth projects may include constructing or
purchasing pipelines and treatment and processing facilities, which subjects NiSource to
construction risks and risks that gas supplies will not be available. If NiSource undertakes these
projects, it may not be able to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs. NiSource
may construct or purchase these projects to capture anticipated future growth in production in the
region, which may not materialize, and the construction may occur over an extended period of time,
and NiSource will not receive material increases in revenue and cash flows until after the
completion of the project. NiSource competes for these projects with companies of varying size and
financial capabilities, including some that may have advantages competing for natural gas and liquid gas
supplies, as well as acquisitions and other business opportunities.

Sustained extreme weather conditions may negatively impact NiSource’s operations.

NiSource conducts its operations across a wide geographic area subject to varied and potentially
extreme weather conditions, which may from time to time persist for sustained periods of time.
Despite preventative maintenance efforts, persistent weather related stress on NiSource’s
infrastructure may reveal weaknesses in its systems not previously known to the company or
otherwise present various operational challenges across all business segments. Although NiSource
makes every effort to plan for weather related contingencies, adverse weather may affect its
ability to conduct operations in a manner that satisfies customer expectations or contractual
obligations. The company endeavors to minimize such service disruptions, but may not be able to
avoid them altogether.


ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

NiSource Inc.

Growing competition in the gas transportation industry could result in the failure by customers to
renew existing contracts.

As a consequence of the increase in competition in the industry and the shift in natural gas
production areas, end users and LDCs may be reluctant to enter into long-term service contracts.
The renewal or replacement of existing contracts with NiSource’s customers at rates sufficient to
maintain current or projected revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond its
control, including competition from other pipelines, gatherers, the proximity of supplies to the
markets, and the price of, and demand for, natural gas. The inability of NiSource to renew, or
replace its current contracts as they expire and respond appropriately to changing market
conditions could materially impact its financial results.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.


ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

NiSource Inc.

Discussed below are the principal properties held by NiSource and its subsidiaries as of December
31, 2010.

Gas Distribution Operations.

its Kokomo Gas system, 1,051 miles of pipelines and an LNG facility with a capacity of 4.9 million
gallons. The physical properties of the NiSource gas utilities are located throughout Ohio,
Indiana, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, and Massachusetts.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations.

NiSource Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries own and
operate 14,772 miles of jurisdictional interstate natural gas transmission pipeline. Columbia
Transmission owns and leases approximately 775 thousand acres of underground storage, 3,518 storage
wells, 11,193 miles of interstate pipeline and 91 compressor stations with 624,179 hp of installed
capacity. Columbia Transmission’s operations are located in Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, New
Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. Columbia Gulf
has 3,377 miles of transmission pipeline and 11 compressor stations with 470,238 hp of installed
capacity. Columbia Gulf’s operations are located in Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee,
Texas and Wyoming. Crossroads Pipeline has 202 miles of transmission pipeline and one compressor
station with 3,000 hp of installed capacity. Crossroads Pipeline’s operations are located in
Indiana and Ohio. NiSource Gas Transmission and Storage Operations’ offices are headquartered in
Houston, Texas.

Electric Operations.

NiSource generates, transmits and distributes electricity through its
subsidiary Northern Indiana to approximately 458 thousand customers in 20 counties in the northern
part of Indiana and engages in wholesale and transmission transactions. Northern Indiana operates
three coal-fired electric generating stations. The three operating facilities have a net
capability of 2,574 mw. Northern Indiana also owns and operates Sugar Creek, a CCGT plant with a
535 mw capacity rating, four gas-fired generating units located at Northern Indiana’s coal-fired
electric generating stations with a net capability of 203 mw and two hydroelectric generating
plants with a net capability of 10 mw. These facilities provide for a total system operating net
capability of 3,322 mw. Sugar Creek was purchased in May 2008 and dispatched into MISO on December
1, 2008. Northern Indiana’s transmission system, with voltages from 69,000 to 345,000 volts,
consists of 2,795 circuit miles. Northern Indiana is interconnected with five neighboring electric
utilities.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, Northern Indiana generated 86.7% and purchased 13.3% of
its electric requirements. Northern Indiana’s Mitchell Station, indefinitely shut down in 2002, is
not included in the net capacity of the three coal-fired generation stations. In the order
received on May 25, 2010 related to the 2008 rate case, the IURC approved a rate base that excludes
the Mitchell Station. All utility plant assets of the Mitchell Station in service were retired and
construction work-in-process (CWIP), materials and supplies, and base coal totaling $4.3 million
were expensed during the third quarter of 2010 as there were no future economic benefits associated
with these assets.

Corporate and Other Operations.

NiSource owns the Southlake Complex, its 325,000 square foot
headquarters building located in Merrillville, Indiana, and other residential and development
property.

Character of Ownership.

The principal offices and properties of NiSource and its subsidiaries are
held in fee and are free from encumbrances, subject to minor exceptions, none of which are of such
a nature as to impair substantially the usefulness of such properties. Many of the offices in
various communities served are occupied by subsidiaries of NiSource under leases. All properties
are subject to liens for taxes, assessments and undetermined charges (if any) incidental to
construction. It is NiSource’s practice regularly to pay such amounts, as and when due, unless
contested in good faith. In general, the electric lines, gas pipelines and related facilities are
located on land not owned in fee but are covered by necessary consents of various governmental
authorities or by appropriate rights obtained from owners of private property. NiSource does not,
however, generally have specific easements from the


ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

NiSource Inc.

owners of the property adjacent to public highways over, upon or under which its electric lines and
gas distribution pipelines are located. At the time each of the principal properties was purchased
a title search was made. In general, no examination of titles as to rights-of-way for electric
lines, gas pipelines or related facilities was made, other than examination, in certain cases, to
verify the grantors’ ownership and the lien status thereof.


ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

NiSource Inc.

1.

Tawney, et al. v. Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., Roane County, WV Circuit Court

The Plaintiffs, who are West Virginia landowners, filed a lawsuit in early 2003 in the West
Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County, West Virginia (the “Trial Court”) against CNR alleging
that CNR underpaid royalties on gas produced on their land by improperly deducting post-production
costs and not paying a fair value for the gas. Plaintiffs also claimed that Defendants
fraudulently concealed the deduction of post-production charges. In December 2004, the Trial Court
granted Plaintiffs’ motion to add NiSource and Columbia as Defendants. The Trial Court later
certified the case as a class action that includes any person who, after July 31, 1990, received or
is due royalties from CNR (and its predecessors or successors) on lands lying within the boundary
of the state of West Virginia. Although NiSource sold CNR in 2003, NiSource remained obligated to
manage this litigation and was responsible for the majority of any damages awarded to Plaintiffs.
On January 27, 2007, the jury hearing the case returned a verdict against all Defendants in the
amount of $404.3 million inclusive of both compensatory and punitive damages; Defendants
subsequently filed their Petition for Appeal, which was later amended, with the West Virginia
Supreme Court of Appeals (the “Appeals Court”), which refused the petition on May 22, 2008. On
August 22, 2008, Defendants filed Petitions to the United States Supreme Court for writ of
certiorari. Given the Appeals Court’s earlier refusal of the appeal, NiSource adjusted its reserve
in the second quarter of 2008 to reflect the portion of the Trial Court judgment for which NiSource
would be responsible, inclusive of interest. This amount was included in “Legal and environmental
reserves,” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008. On October 24, 2008, the
Trial Court preliminarily approved a Settlement Agreement with a total settlement amount of $380
million. The settlement received final approval by the Trial Court on November 22, 2008.
NiSource’s share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its
obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund
by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the
amount of $254 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the
settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. The Trial Court entered its Order
discharging the judgment on January 20, 2009 and is supervising the administration of the
settlement proceeds. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource has contributed a total of $330.5 million
into the qualified settlement fund, $277.3 million of which was contributed prior to December 31,
2009. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability has not been paid.
NiSource contributed an additional $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource will be
required to make additional payments, pursuant to the settlement, upon notice from the Class
Administrator.

Environmental Protection Agency Notice of Violation

On September 29, 2004, the EPA issued an NOV to Northern Indiana for alleged violations of the CAA
and the Indiana SIP. The NOV alleges that modifications were made to certain boiler units at three
of Northern Indiana’s generating stations between the years 1985 and 1995 without obtaining
appropriate air permits for the modifications.
Northern Indiana, EPA, Department of Justice, and IDEM have agreed to settle the NOV.

The
parties reached a  settlement  in a consent decree that was filed in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Indiana on January 13, 2011. The consent decree covers
Northern Indiana’s four coal generating stations: Bailly, Michigan City, R.M. Schahfer, and D.H.
Mitchell. Northern Indiana must surrender environmental permits for D.H. Mitchell’s coal-fired
boilers, which have not been used to generate power since 2002. At the other generating stations,
Northern Indiana must install additional control equipment, including three new SO2 control devices
and one new NOx control device. The consent decree also imposes emissions limits for NOx, SO2, and
particulate, and annual tonnage limits for NOx and SO2. In addition, Northern Indiana must
surrender certain NOx and SO2 allowances, pay fines of $3.5 million, and invest $9.5 million in
environmental mitigation projects. Northern Indiana is estimating the cost of NSR related capital
improvements at $550.0 to $650.0 million, which will be expended between 2010 and 2018. Northern
Indiana believes the capital costs will likely be recoverable from ratepayers.

Majorsville Operations Center – PADEP Notice of Violation

In 1995, Columbia Transmission entered into an AOC with the EPA that requires Columbia Transmission
to characterize and remediate environmental contamination at thousands of locations along Columbia
Transmission’s


ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

NiSource Inc.

pipeline system. One of the facilities subject to the AOC is the Majorsville Operations Center,
which was remediated under an EPA approved Remedial Action Work Plan in summer 2008. Pursuant to
the Remedial Action Work Plan, Columbia Transmission completed a project that stabilized residual
oil contained in soils at the site and in sediments in an adjacent stream. Columbia Transmission
continues to monitor this site subject to EPA oversight.

On April 23, 2009, however, the PADEP issued Columbia Transmission an NOV, alleging that the
remediation did not fully address the contamination. The NOV asserts violations of the Pennsylvania
Clean Streams Law and the Pennsylvania Solid Waste Management Act and includes a settlement demand
in the amount of $1 million. Columbia Transmission is unable to estimate the likelihood or cost of
potential penalties or additional remediation at this time.

outstanding.

Holders of shares of NiSource’s common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, and if
declared by NiSource’s Board out of funds legally available. The policy of the Board has been to
declare cash dividends on a quarterly basis payable on or about the 20th day of February, May,
August and November. NiSource paid quarterly common dividends totaling $0.92 per share for the
years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. At its January 19, 2011 meeting, the Board declared
a quarterly common dividend of $0.23 per share, payable on February 18, 2011 to holders of record

Note regarding forward-looking statements

The Management’s Discussion and Analysis, including statements regarding market risk sensitive
instruments, contains “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Investors and prospective investors should understand that many factors govern whether
any forward-looking statement contained herein will be or can be realized. Any one of those
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning NiSource’s plans,
objectives, expected performance, expenditures and recovery of expenditures through rates, stated
on either a consolidated or segment basis, and any and all underlying assumptions and other
statements that are other than statements of historical fact. From time to time, NiSource may
publish or otherwise make available forward-looking statements of this nature. All such subsequent
forward-looking statements, whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of NiSource,
are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. All forward-looking statements are
based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance
that actual results will not differ materially.

Realization of NiSource’s objectives and expected performance is subject to a wide range of risks
and can be adversely affected by, among other things, weather, fluctuations in supply and demand
for energy commodities, growth opportunities for NiSource’s businesses, increased competition in

CONSOLIDATED REVIEW

Executive Summary

NiSource is an energy holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 whose
subsidiaries are engaged in the transmission, storage and distribution of natural gas in the
high-demand energy corridor stretching from the Gulf Coast through the Midwest to New England and
the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in Indiana. NiSource generates
virtually 100% of its operating income through these rate-regulated businesses. A significant
portion of NiSource’s operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales. During the heating
season, which is primarily from November through March, net revenues from gas sales are more
significant, and during the cooling season, which is primarily from June through September, net
revenues from electric sales and transportation services are more significant than in other months.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

NiSource Inc.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, NiSource reported income from continuing operations
of $294.6 million, or $1.06 per basic share, compared to $230.5 million, or $0.84 per basic share
for the same period in 2009.

Increases in income from continuing operations were due primarily to the following items:

•

Electric Operations’ net revenues increased $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was
primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved
economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase
in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally,
there was an increase of $14.6 million in off-system sales, including a reduction of $8.2
million in off-system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement.

•

NiSource’s Gas Transmission and Storage Operations’ net revenues increased $18.5 million
primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues from growth projects of $22.9
million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously
deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission
following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. These increases in revenue were
partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1
million.

•

The effective tax rate decreased to 32.4% compared to 41.8% for the comparable period last
year. The decrease is due to NiSource recording a $15.2 million reduction in income tax
expense in the third quarter of 2010 as a result of a rate case settlement by Columbia of
Pennsylvania that requires the company to flow through certain tax benefits to customers in
current rates. Additionally, the company experienced increases in income tax expense in 2009
for additional deferred income tax expense related to state apportionment changes.

Increases in income from continuing operations were partially offset due to the following item:

•

On December 30, 2010, NiSource Finance finalized a cash tender offer for $273.1 million
aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due in 2016. As a result of this
tender offer, NiSource incurred $96.7 million in early redemption fees, primarily attributable
to early redemption premiums and unamortized discounts and fees, which is recorded as a loss
on the early extinguishment of long-term debt.

These factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the
following discussions of “Results of Operations” and “Results and Discussion of Segment
Operations.”

Four-Point Platform for Growth

NiSource’s four key initiatives to build a platform for long-term, sustainable growth continue to
comprise commercial and regulatory initiatives; commercial growth and expansion of the gas
transmission and storage business; financial management of the balance sheet; and process and
expense management.

Commercial and Regulatory Initiatives

Rate Development and Other Regulatory Matters

. NiSource is moving forward with regulatory
initiatives across several gas distribution company markets, at Northern Indiana, and at Columbia
Gulf. Whether through full rate case filings or other approaches, NiSource’s goal is to develop
strategies that benefit all stakeholders as it addresses changing customer conservation patterns,
develops more contemporary pricing structures, and embarks on long-term investment programs to
enhance its infrastructure.

On November 19, 2010, Northern Indiana filed a petition for new electric base rates and charges.
The filing requests an increase in base rates calculated to produce additional gross revenue of
$75.7 million when compared to a normalized test year ended June 30, 2010. This is calculated to
provide the opportunity to earn a return of 7.70% on net original cost rate base of $2,706 million.
If approved, the rates from this new petition would replace any other existing rates, including
those that may be approved by effect of the August 25, 2010 rate order for the 2008 rate case. The
proposed rates would ease bill impacts on residential customers, while still allowing Northern

to continue investing in service, reliability and infrastructure improvements. Northern Indiana
filed the proceeding under the IURC’s minimum standard filing requirements prescribing timeframes
for issuance of an order if required information is supplied as part of the rate case filing. The
IURC held its prehearing conference on December 17, 2010 and issued a prehearing conference order
on January 5, 2011. The parties agreed to and the IURC ordered a procedural schedule that includes
a bifurcated hearing. The evidentiary hearing on Northern Indiana’s case-in-chief is scheduled for
the week of February 28, 2011, and the evidentiary hearing for the remainder of the case is
scheduled for the weeks of July 11, 2011 and July 25, 2011. The case is scheduled to be fully
briefed by September 30, 2011 and an Order is anticipated by the end of 2011 with the
implementation of new rates anticipated in the first quarter of 2012.

On January 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC,
seeking a revenue increase of approximately $37.8 million annually, and seeking to implement a
levelized distribution charge for its residential class that would mitigate revenue volatility
associated with volumetric rates and provide residential customers with clear price signals.
Columbia of Pennsylvania expects that the Pennsylvania PUC will issue an order in the third or
fourth quarter of 2011 with rates going into effect in the fourth quarter.

On May 3, 2010, Northern Indiana filed a natural gas rate case with the IURC. Northern Indiana
entered into a comprehensive settlement with all parties on August 24, 2010. The Settlement
Agreement was approved in entirety by Order issued on November 4, 2010 and new rates were placed
into effect November 5, 2010. The order resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately $14.9
million when compared to a normalized test year ended December 31, 2009. The IURC authorized
Northern Indiana to increase the monthly fixed charge for residential customers from $6.36 to
$11.00. The IURC also approved revised depreciation accrual rates for gas plant and authorized
Northern Indiana to reduce current period gas plant depreciation expense by up to $25.7 million
annually for the next four years or until further order of the IURC, whichever occurs first.

On May 3, 2010, Columbia of Virginia filed a base rate case with the VSCC seeking an annual revenue
increase of $13.0 million to recover an updated level of costs upon the expiration of its
Performance Based Regulation Plan on December 31, 2010. Columbia of Virginia also sought a Weather
Normalization Adjustment (“WNA”), cost recovery of certain gas related items through its Purchased
Gas Adjustment (“PGA”) mechanism rather than base rates, and forward looking adjustments predicted
to occur during the rate year ending December 31, 2011. On November 16, 2010, Columbia of
Virginia, the VSCC Staff and the other parties filed a Proposed Stipulation and Recommendation
(“Stipulation”) that would result in an annual revenue increase of $4.9 million, including
authorization of the WNA and recovery of certain gas related items through the PGA mechanism. The
Chief Hearing Examiner issued a Report on December 2, 2010 recommending approval of the
Stipulation. The VSCC issued a Final Order on December 17, 2010 adopting the Stipulation. New
rates became effective January 1, 2011.

On January 28, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC. On
June 25, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania and the other active parties filed a Joint Petition for
Settlement that would result in an annual revenue increase of $12.0 million. On August 18, 2010,
the Pennsylvania PUC entered a final order approving the Joint Petition for Settlement and new
rates went into effect on October 1, 2010.

On January 28, 2010, Columbia of Maryland filed a base rate case with the Maryland PSC, seeking a
revenue increase of $2.2 million annually in order for Columbia of Maryland to earn the rate of
return authorized by the PSC in its 2008 rate case. On May 10, 2010, the parties filed a Joint
Motion for Approval of Stipulation and Settlement Agreement that would result in an annual revenue
increase of approximately $1.7 million. The Maryland PSC issued a final order approving the
Settlement, and new rates went into effect on May 28, 2010.

On October 28, 2010, Columbia Gulf filed a rate case with the FERC, proposing a rate increase and
tariff changes. Among other things, the filing proposes a revenue increase of approximately $50.0
million to cover increases in the cost of services, which includes adjustments for operation and
maintenance expenses, capital investments, adjustments to depreciation rates and expense, rate of
return, and increased federal, state and local taxes. New rates are expected to be effective by
May 2011, subject to refund.

On September 1, 2010 Northern Indiana, NIFL and Kokomo filed to merge into one company (Northern
Indiana). NIFL and Kokomo also filed rate proceedings on September 1, 2010. On February 23, 2011,
a stipulation and  settlement agreement was filed that provides for the merger and settlement of the
rate proceedings. The settlement stipulates that all of Northern Indiana’s existing services,
rates and charges will be applicable in the former NIFL and Kokomo territories, including one
unified Gas Cost Adjustment mechanism. The application of Northern Indiana’s rates in the former
NIFL and Kokomo territories will result in a decrease in revenue of approximately $0.8 million,
when compared to a normalized test year ended March 31, 2010. This is primarily offset by
reductions in depreciation expense. A settlement hearing is scheduled for March 23, 2011 and an
order is anticipated in the second quarter of 2011.

Refer to Note 8, “Regulatory Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a
complete discussion of regulatory matters.

Bear Garden Station

. In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion
Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in
Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3
miles of 24-inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the
VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Company’s planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginia’s
facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010.

Commercial Growth and Expansion of the Gas Transmission and Storage Business

During 2010, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations advanced or completed more than $150 million
in strategic growth projects serving the Marcellus Shale production area and capable of providing
market access to more than 500,000 Dth per day of natural gas.

East Lateral Project.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million
project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral,
allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm
transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five-year terms. Gas
Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into
service on April 1, 2011.

Line WB Expansion Project.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB
system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide
transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion
will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin.
Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity
have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
segment requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all of the
facilities in the third quarter of 2011.

Southern Appalachian Project.

As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services
to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is
expanding Line SM-116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This
additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional
facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service
expected to commence in April 2011.

Cobb Compressor Station Project.

This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations segment strategy to meet producers’ near-term, incremental transportation demand in the
Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately
25,500 Dth per day of long-term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at
Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Compressor Station expansion
totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17,
2010.

OF OPERATIONS

NiSource Inc.

Majorsville, PA Project.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three
separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate
Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and
compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations to gather and deliver more than
325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing
plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C.

In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain
transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed
affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non-FERC
jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three
projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering
and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West
Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009,
which were superseded by the execution of long-term service agreements in August and September
2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver
residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge
compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to
eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter of 2011.

Clendenin Project.

Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area
in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project
allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of
up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been
executed, some which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second
quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million.

Financial Management of the Balance Sheet

NiSource remains committed to maintaining its liquidity position through management of capital
spending, working capital and operational requirements, and its financing needs. NiSource has
executed on its plan by taking the following actions:

sponsored by BTMU. The maximum seasonal program limit under the terms of the agreement is $75
million. CPRC’s agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled termination date of
March 14, 2011 and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31,
2010, $46.6 million of accounts receivable had been transferred by CPRC.

Credit Ratings

. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at
BBB-, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitch’s outlook for NiSource and all of
its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moody’s Investors Service affirmed the senior
unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries.
Moody’s outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is
stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard
& Poor’s affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB-. Standard
& Poor’s outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue
to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s or Fitch would result in a rating
that is below investment grade.

Process and Expense Management

Refer to Note 3, “Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for information on process and expense management.

Ethics and Controls

NiSource has had a long term commitment to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as
well as high standards for ethical behavior by its employees. NiSource’s senior management takes
an active role in the development of this Form 10-K and the monitoring of the company’s internal
control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue its mandatory ethics
training program in which employees at every level throughout the organization participate.

Refer to “Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting” included in Item 9A.

Results of Operations

The following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies
applied by NiSource as discussed in “Other Information” of this Item 7.

Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, NiSource reported income from continuing operations
of $294.6 million, or $1.06 per basic share, compared to $230.5 million, or $0.84 per basic share
in 2009. Income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was
$370.6 million, or $1.35 per basic share.

Including results from discontinued operations, NiSource reported 2010 net income of $292.0
million, or $1.05 per basic share, 2009 net income of $217.7 million, or $0.79 per basic share, and
2008 net income of $79.0 million, or $0.29 per basic share.

Comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow
for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. Therefore, increases in
these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no
impact on income from continuing operations. A decrease in operating expenses of $7.6 million for
the 2010 year was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting these tracked
costs. In the 2009 period, an increase in operating expenses of $16.3 million for trackers was
offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs. These
fluctuations in 2010 and in 2009 were largely attributable to the changes in the recovery of
uncollectible accounts.

Net Revenues

NiSource analyzes the operating results using net revenues. Net revenues are calculated as revenues
less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net
revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the
majority of the cost of sales are tracked

costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount
reflected in gross operating revenues.

Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, were $3,447.9
million, a $115.3 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to
increased Electric Operations’ net revenues of $121.5 million and increased Gas Transmission and
Storage Operations’ net revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution
Operations’ net revenues of $6.9 million.

•

Electric Operations’ net revenues increased as a result of higher industrial usage and
margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of
approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which
are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6
million in off-system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off-system sales in
2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6
million.

•

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations’ net revenues increased primarily due to
increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of growth projects of $22.9
million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously
deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia
Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was
a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense and $5.4
million of fees received from a contract buy-out during the period. These increases in
revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage
services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing
revenues.

•

Gas Distribution Operations’ net revenues decreased due to lower regulatory and tax
trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense and decreased residential and commercial
margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period
contract of $5.7 million established at Columbia of Massachusetts, customer credits of $5.6
million issued as a result of a rate case, and a decrease in forfeited discounts and late
payments of $5.0 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in
regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at
various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohio’s approved
infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of
Virginia.

Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 were $3,332.6
million, an $85.7 million increase compared with 2008. Net revenues increased primarily due to
increased Gas Distribution Operations’ net revenues of $66.7 million and increased Gas Transmission
and Storage Operations’ net revenues of $65.4 million, partially offset by lower Electric
Operations’ net revenues of $41.0 million.

•

Gas Distribution Operations’ net revenues were higher due to increased revenues of $97.2
million from regulatory initiatives including impacts from rate proceedings, partially
offset by decreased residential and industrial customer usage of $22.0 million, a $13.0
million decrease in off-system sales and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8
million.

•

Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, net revenues increased due to increases
in firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million, shorter-term transportation and storage
services of $18.6 million and mineral rights leasing of $12.2 million. The increase in firm
capacity reservation fees was the result of growth projects such as the Eastern Market
Expansion, the Ohio Storage Expansion and new Appalachian supply contracts.

•

Electric Operations’ net revenues decreased due to the impact of cooler weather of
approximately $18 million, lower industrial usage of $17.4 million, which was significantly
impacted by economic conditions, lower capacity and energy sales into the PJM
Interconnection of $13.5 million, $9.1 million of lower off-system sales and $9.5 million
lower emission allowance sales, partially offset by increased residential and commercial
usage of $12.4 million and lower non-recoverable purchased power of $10.1 million. The

major steel company customers operated at full capacity for the first half of 2008.
Production decreased sharply in October 2008, bottoming near 50% in May 2009. Since then,
NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers.

Expenses

Operating expenses were $2,541.6 million in 2010, a decrease of $6.0 million from the comparable
2009 period. This decrease was primarily due to decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million,
lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million, decreased
legal reserves of $12.0 million, and decreased trackers of $7.5 million, offset in net revenues.
The decreases above were partially offset by an increase of $36.1 million in payroll and benefits
expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline
costs, and an increase of $7.0 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital
expenditures.

Operating expenses were $2,547.6 million in 2009, an increase of $207.4 million from the comparable
2008 period. This increase was mainly due to higher employee and administrative expenses of $102.3
million, which primarily resulted from higher pension expense of $84.8 million, net of deferring
$10.7 million of pension costs under the regulatory order that was granted to Columbia of Ohio in
July 2009, and higher payroll and benefits expense of $29.6 million. Operating expenses also
increased as a result of restructuring charges of $27.2 million, impairment charges of $22.8
million in 2009, higher depreciation of $22.0 million, $21.6 million in increased legal reserves,
and increased trackers of $16.3 million offset in net revenues. The increase in benefits expense
is due in part to a $12.7 million adjustment that decreased expense in the third quarter of 2008,
which resulted from the misclassification of certain claims in 2007.

Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates

Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010, a decrease of $1.0 million
compared with 2009. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in
Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia
Transmission’s investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss
amortization related to Millennium’s August 2010 debt refinancing.

Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $16.0 million in 2009 compared to $12.3 million
in 2008. Equity earnings from Millennium, which was placed into service on December 22, 2008,
totaled $12.1 million for 2009, net of an $8.1 million reduction resulting from interest rate
hedges relating to Millennium’s decision to delay permanent financing until 2010.

Other Income (Deductions)

Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2
million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the
early extinguishment of long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0
million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long-term
debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the company’s
$417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short-term interest rates. The interest
expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance
of $250.0 million of long-term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December
2009 long-term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the
company’s accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of
$1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest
expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above.

Other Income (Deductions) in 2009 reduced income $405.2 million compared to a reduction of $362.4
million in 2008. Interest expense increased primarily due to incremental interest expense
associated with the issuance of $700 million of long-term debt in May 2008, the issuance of $600
million of long-term debt in March 2009 and a $385 million two-year term loan entered into in April
2009, partially offset by the open market repurchase of $100 million of long-term debt in January
2009, the $250.6 million tender offer repurchase of long-term debt in April 2009 and lower
short-term interest rates. Other, net was a loss of $1.4 million compared to income of $17.6
million for 2008

NiSource Inc.

primarily due to the sale of an investment in 2008 at a gain and lower interest income in 2009. On
August 27, 2008, NiSource Development Company sold its interest in JOF Transportation Company to
Lehigh Service Corporation for a pre-tax gain of $16.7 million. JOF Transportation Company held a
40% interest in Chicago South Shore & South Bend Railroad Co. and a 40% interest in Indiana
Illinois Development Company, LLC.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates were 32.4%, 41.8%, and 33.4% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
The 9.4% decrease in the overall effective tax rate in 2010 versus 2009 was primarily due to the
2010 rate settlements resulting in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. In 2009, the
company recorded in its tax provision the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased
tax expense $5.3 million, additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily
to state income tax apportionment changes, and a reduction in AFUDC-Equity that increased tax
expense by $3.2 million. In 2008, the effective tax rate was reduced by $14.9 million for the
change in Massachusetts state taxes discussed below.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the Internal Revenue Service to
change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal
Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The company recorded a net long-term
receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to
reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this
method change.

In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in
connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case
settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense results from the settlement
agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method
change for certain capitalized costs approved by the Internal Revenue Service.

The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax
deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the
Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax
asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At
the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSource’s obligation
to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 – Income Taxes requires the impact
of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income
statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource
reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug
Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the
reversal of the related regulatory liability.

During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax
method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and
state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method,
NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009,
$263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009
and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal
income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state
restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax
expense of $5.5 million.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Governor of Massachusetts signed into law a bill that
significantly changed the Massachusetts corporate income tax regime. Under the law, which became
effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, NiSource calculates its
Massachusetts income tax liability on a unitary basis, meaning that the income tax obligation to
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is determined based on an apportioned share of all of NiSource’s
income, rather than just the income of NiSource’s subsidiaries doing business in Massachusetts.
Because of NiSource’s substantial operations outside of Massachusetts, the new law had the impact
of reducing the deferred income tax liability to Massachusetts. NiSource recognized the impact of
this tax law change as a $14.9

million reduction in income tax expense in 2008. Income tax expense for 2009 and 2010 reflects the
impact of the law on a prospective basis.

Discontinued Operations

Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, a
loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009, and a loss of $291.6 million, or
$1.06 loss per basic share, in 2008.

The losses in 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries
where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009
associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties.

The loss in 2008 is primarily attributable to an adjustment to the reserve for the Tawney
litigation and losses from businesses disposed during the year. During 2008 NiSource recorded an
after-tax loss of $108.2 million for the dispositions of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and
Whiting Clean Energy. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations
of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy as discontinued operations. As
such, net income of $4.4 million was classified as discontinued operations for the year ended 2008.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

A significant portion of NiSource’s operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas
transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During
the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales
and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on
hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the
summer cooling season and external short-term and long-term financing, is used to purchase gas to
place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities.
NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under
its short-term revolver, long-term debt agreements and NiSource’s ability to access the capital
markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital
expenditures in 2011.

Operating Activities

Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4
million, a decrease of $940.8 million from a year ago. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009
over-recovered gas costs resulted in a $250.4 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas
price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under-recovered gas cost resulted in a $324.4
million source of working capital. Although there have been no changes in the operation of the
accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860,
attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with
accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher
than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working
capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than
normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.5 million use of working capital
when paid in 2009.

Tawney Settlement

. NiSource’s share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. The
Trial Court entered its Order discharging the judgment on January 20, 2009 and is supervising the
administration of the settlement proceeds. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, NiSource contributed $53.2
million, $252.3 million and $25.0 million, respectively, into the qualified settlement fund which
is recorded as net operating activities used for discontinued operations in the Statements of
Consolidated Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability
had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately an additional $2.7 million subsequent to
December 31, 2010. NiSource will be required to make additional payments, pursuant to the
settlement, upon notice from the Class Administrator. Refer to Part I, Item 3, “Legal
Proceedings,” for additional information.

Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding

. In 2010, NiSource contributed $161.8 million to its
pension plans and $50.0 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2011, NiSource
expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 million to its pension plans and
approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2010,
NiSource’s pension and other post-retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $578.4 million and
$429.2 million, respectively.

For 2011, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be
$1,100.0 million, which is $188.4 million higher than the 2010 capital program. This increased
spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the
Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations
segment. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations,
equity, and short-term debt.

For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an
increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to
increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher
expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations
segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase
within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and
transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is primarily due
to higher expenditures on maintenance projects.

For 2009, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $798.6 million, a
decrease of $508.0 million versus 2008. A significant amount of the decrease was due to lower
capital expenditures within Electric Operations of $389.8 million, due to increased 2008 capital
expenditures for the purchase of Sugar Creek. Capital expenditures decreased within Gas
Distribution Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $26.5 million and $96.4
million, respectively. The decrease within Gas Distribution Operations segment was primarily due to
lower expenditures on maintenance activities. The decrease within the Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects relative to 2008.

In 2008, NiSource received proceeds from the sale of Whiting Clean Energy, Northern Utilities, and
Granite State of $216.7 million, $187.3 million, and $14.3 million, respectively. Since these
businesses were reported as discontinued operations, these amounts are included within, “Net
Investing Activities from Discontinued Operations,” on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.
On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for approximately $330 million to address
the need for additional capacity.

Restricted cash was $202.9 million and $174.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. The increase in restricted cash was due primarily to the change in forward gas
prices which resulted in increased margin deposits on open derivative contracts used within
NiSource’s risk management and energy marketing activities.

NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million, $62.7 million, and $46.7
million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Contributions to equity investees were $87.9 million, $26.4 million, and $39.2 million for 2010,

long-term debt refinancing.

Financing Activities

Long-term Debt.

Refer to Note 16, “Long-term Debt,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for information on long-term debt.

Credit Facilities.

NiSource Finance maintains a $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility
with a syndicate of banks which has a termination date of July 7, 2011. This facility provides a
reasonable cushion of short-term liquidity for general corporate purposes including meeting cash
requirements driven by volatility in natural gas prices, and provides for the issuance of letters
of credit. NiSource currently intends to negotiate a new revolving credit facility during the
first quarter of 2011. During September 2008, NiSource Finance entered into an additional $500
million six-month revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital that
was originally due to expire on March 23, 2009. However, on February 13, 2009, the six-month
credit facility was terminated in conjunction with the closing of a new two-year bank term loan.
The two year term loan was subsequently repaid in December 2009 with proceeds from the December 4,
2009, $500.0 million debt offering.

NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31,
2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%, and borrowings of $103.0 million at December
31, 2009, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.59%. The increase in borrowings compared to
2009 is mainly the result of the maturity of $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes in
November of 2010 and the cash tender offer of $273.1 million of its 10.75% notes due 2016 and the
related early redemption premiums.

As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, NiSource Finance had $32.5 million and $87.8
million, respectively, of stand-by letters of credit outstanding of which $14.2 million and $85.0
million were under the five-year revolving credit facility. A letter of credit of $254 million was
issued on January 13, 2009 to cover payments related to the Tawney settlement, which was terminated
on December 29, 2010.

As of December 31, 2010, an aggregate of $378.3 million of credit was available under the credit
facility.

Debt Covenants

.

NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five-year revolving credit
facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not
exceed 70%. A similar covenant in the 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires
NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31,
2010, the ratio was 59.9%.

NiSource is also subject to certain other non-financial covenants under the revolving credit
facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on
NiSource’s assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests,
preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset
sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and/or transfer of NiSource’s assets to no more
than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the
fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource
Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all
other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility
also include a cross-default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit
facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any
of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more.

NiSource’s indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However,
NiSource’s indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured
payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on
NiSource’s assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests,
preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSource’s
consolidated net tangible assets.

.

Refer to Note 19, “Transfers of Financial Assets,” in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable.

Credit Ratings

.

On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at
BBB-, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitch’s outlook for NiSource and all of
its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moody’s Investors Service affirmed the senior
unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries.
Moody’s outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is
stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard
& Poor’s affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB-. Standard
& Poor’s outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue
to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s or Fitch would result in a rating
that is below investment grade.

Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased
collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB- by
Standard & Poor’s or Baa3 by Moody’s. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and
for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the
ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $18.1 million. In addition to agreements with
ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse
change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and
cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indiana’s trade receivables sales program, an
event of termination occurs if Northern Indiana’s debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard &
Poor’s or Moody’s or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s, respectively.
Likewise, under Columbia of Ohio’s trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs
if NiSource’s debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s, or falls below BB-
or Ba3 at either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s, respectively.

Contractual Obligations

.

NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at
specified periods. The obligations include long-term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity
contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM
outsourcing. The table below excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on the

NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for the
fixed-rate debt, interest is calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for
variable-rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2010. For 2011,
NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $399.6
million, which includes $369.4 million of interest payments related to its long-term debt
outstanding as of December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, NiSource also had $1,382.5 million in
short-term borrowings outstanding.

NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline
business software requiring semi-annual payments of $2.9 million, which is recorded as a capital
lease.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

NiSource Inc.

NiSource’s subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical
quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of
these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices.

In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indiana’s purchase power agreements with
subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These
agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind
power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind
power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of
electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the
table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than
material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required
to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to
termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in
April 2009.

NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and
storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2045, require
NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges.

On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide
business process and support functions to NiSource. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay
IBM for the amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable
charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended Agreement, at
December 31, 2010, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $400 million to IBM in
service fees over the remaining four and a  half year term. In February 2011, NiSource elected to
reduce certain services which will effectively lower the service obligation by approximately $30
million over the remaining service agreement. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for
any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination
charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBM’s unrecovered capital investments, and
IBM wind-down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events
giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination.

NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business
process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries
through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate
Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable
charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage
of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $53.7 million to Vertex
Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. Upon termination of
the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC),
NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $12.4 million.

Northern Indiana has contracts with three major rail operators providing for coal transportation
services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various
periods through 2013 and are included within, “Other service obligations,” in the table of
contractual commitments.

Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products
and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under
this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a
combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various
performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana
terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty-year contract period. Estimated minimum
payments for this agreement are included within, “Other service obligations,” in the table of
contractual commitments.

NiSource’s expected payments included within, “Other liabilities,” in the table of contractual
commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits
plans expected to be made in 2011. Plan contributions beyond 2011 are dependent upon a number of
factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2011,
NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7

million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life
plans. Refer to Note 12, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for more information.

Not included in the table above are $6.0 million of estimated federal and state income tax
liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be
estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for more information.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court
for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSource’s
share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations
under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January
13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of
$254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the
settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had
contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2010,
$8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed
approximately $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010.

NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to
long-term obligations classified as, “Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits,” on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets, other than those described above.

NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll,
sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $313.4
million in 2011, which are not included in the table above.

Off Balance Sheet Items

As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements
providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries.
Such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit.

NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $195 million of commodity-related
payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These
guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial
transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the
commodity-related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee
performance of the seller’s covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and
warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees
are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource
would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the
aforementioned guarantees is remote.

NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20-A, “Guarantees and Indemnities,” in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSource’s off
balance sheet arrangements.

Market Risk Disclosures

Risk is an inherent part of NiSource’s energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly
and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk
involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess,
monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal
risks that are involved in NiSource’s energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk
and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi-faceted process with oversight by the Risk


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

NiSource Inc.

Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized
products and markets. NiSource’s senior management takes an active role in the risk management
process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business
functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition
of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSource’s risk management
policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification.

Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSource’s market and credit
risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from
changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level.

Commodity Price Risk

NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries’ operations involving
natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSource’s subsidiaries use derivatives,
including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative
energy trading activity.

Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSource’s rate-regulated subsidiaries
is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas
costs through the rate-making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments.
If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing
services without the benefit of the traditional rate-making process and may be more exposed to
commodity price risk. Some of NiSource’s rate-regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price
risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage
under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products
and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.

During 2010 and 2009, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative
instruments being accounted for as hedges. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for
hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or
classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2009, NiSource reclassified
$126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions
would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned
to sell. No amounts were reclassified in 2010 or 2008. It is anticipated that during the next
twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income
statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) of approximately $0.8 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, “Risk Management and
Energy Marketing Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information on NiSource’s various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk.

NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual
and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount
of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSource’s restricted cash balance, may fluctuate
significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets.

Interest Rate Risk

NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings
under revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that
are indexed to short-term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk
due to changes in interest rates on fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value
of long-term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in
short-term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short-term interest rates of 100
basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $14.7 million and $19.2
million for the years 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005,
NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six
counterparties. NiSource


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

NiSource Inc.

paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to
interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of
5.67% and 5.88% respectively.

NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics
of its outstanding long-term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance
entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million
with six counterparties having a 6 1/2-year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a
fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6-month BBA LIBOR plus
an average of 3.08% per annum. As discussed below, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance
terminated a fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional
amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of
interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated.

On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in
a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11-year term. NiSource Finance
receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based
on U.S. 6-month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at
the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July
15, 2013.

As of December 31, 2010, $500.0 million of NiSource Finance’s existing long-term debt is subject to
fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed-to-variable interest rate swap
transactions.

Credit Risk

Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSource’s business
activities. NiSource’s extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In
addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval
levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts.
Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent
of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or
counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before
the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are
obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future
date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in
terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted
collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support.

NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate
swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the
use of market-based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through
traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies.

The parent company of one of NiSource’s interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event
of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing
Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed-to-variable
interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The
mark-to-market close-out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was
determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008.

Fair Value Measurement

NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair
value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement. NiSource’s financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and
liabilities, available-for-sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation.

Exchange-traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with
cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into
these valuations. Certain non-exchange-traded derivatives are valued using broker or
over-the-counter, on-line exchanges. In such cases, these non-exchange-


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

NiSource Inc.

traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non-exchange-based derivative instruments
include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models
to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation
models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in
active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are
not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market-corroborated inputs,
i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or
other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or
liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active
markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the
valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the
instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of
derivative instruments that are not exchange-traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect
collateral agreements which reduce exposures.

Price risk management assets also include fixed-to-floating interest-rate swaps, which are
designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable-rate debt as
a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future
outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current
fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well
as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are
based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest-rate swaps are
categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value
calculation of the interest rate swap.

Refer to Note 18, “Fair Value Disclosures,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information on NiSource’s fair value measurements.

Market Risk Measurement

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates,
indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in
losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one-day VaR at a 95%
confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The
daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1
million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the
VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management
actions to reduce portfolio risk.

Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies” included in this Item 7 and Note 1-U, “Accounting for Risk
Management and Energy Marketing Activities,” and Note 9, “Risk Management and Energy Marketing
Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSource’s
risk management.

Other Information

Critical Accounting Policies

NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below
that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSource’s results of operations
and Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.

ASC Topic 980,

Regulated Operations

, provides
that rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the
economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are
designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment
makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits
subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in
service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets
and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7
million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009,
respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, “Regulatory Matters,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

NiSource Inc.

In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its
costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the
criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980,

Regulated Operations

. In such event, a write-down
of all or a portion of NiSource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If
transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the
requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory
assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be
reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic
980,

Regulated Operations

, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980-20,

Discontinuation of Rate-Regulated Accounting

. In management’s opinion, NiSource’s regulated
subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980,

Regulated Operations

for the foreseeable future.

Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets require
specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of
these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for
deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to
$335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as
regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the
extent of the unrecoverable amounts.

Accounting for Risk Management Activities.

Under ASC Topic 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, the
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the
derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each
period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory
assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize
derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the
disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in
earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of
the rate-making process, the rate-regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as
regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the
contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings
are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates.

In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the
hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness
test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout
the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded
currently in earnings.

Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate
certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is
such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the
underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange-traded natural gas futures and options
contracts and over-the-counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its
natural-gas-related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk
management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010
and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management
liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and
2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Pensions and Postretirement Benefits.

NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and
other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related
to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in
bringing the liabilities to present value, long-term returns on plan assets and employee longevity,
among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long-term nature of the associated
liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts
on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion
of NiSource’s pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, “Pension and Other
Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

NiSource Inc.

Goodwill.

NiSource’s goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which
resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes
$13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required,
NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or
circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSource’s annual goodwill test
takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010.
The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the
goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long-term growth rates,
discount rates and fair market values.

These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and
forward-looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third-party
valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis.
NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable;
however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to
NiSource’s discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the
discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia
Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia
Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations.

Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test
could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than
expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount
rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or
if NiSource’s market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of
time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010.

Refer to Notes 1-J and 6, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

Long-lived Asset Impairment Testing

. NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long-lived
assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic
980,

Regulated Operations

. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential
earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value could be impaired. When an asset’s carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future
cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the
asset’s fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 -K, “Long-lived Assets,” and
Note 3, “Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.

Contingencies.

A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental,
tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated.
Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated
probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and
associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and
regulations. Management’s assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of
future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates
and can have a material impact on NiSource’s results of operations and financial position. Refer
to Note 20, “Other Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.

Asset Retirement Obligations.

Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an
asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market
prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques,
using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows
associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit-adjusted risk free rates. When
the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the
carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the
capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate-regulated
subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and
the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to

Note 7, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.

Revenue.

Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed
to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include
estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of
commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income
upon delivery of the commodities.

Taxes.

Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates.

Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where
regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or
liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded
to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts
applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between
the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Refer to Note 2, “Recent Accounting Pronouncements,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource.

International Financial Reporting Standards

In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high
quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan
addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In
October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported,
among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging
their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time
(endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to
require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman
publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of
IFRS is mandated.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand
the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential
organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences
between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS
would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure
changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and
management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part
of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS.
This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSource’s strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS,
will be re-assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and
by what method.

Environmental Matters

NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of
air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other
environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those
environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSource’s business and operations. Refer to
Note 20-D, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding environmental matters.

Bargaining Unit Contract

As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times
beginning in September 2011 through June 2015.

2010 Health Care Act

The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax
deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the
Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax
asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At
the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSource’s obligation
to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740,

Income Taxes,

requires the
impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income
statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource
reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug
Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the
reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded
in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010.

A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of
lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource
Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the “Consolidated Flex Plan”), a component welfare benefit plan of
the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and
capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health
Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a
significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan
assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex
Plan and established the NiSource Post-65 Retiree Medical Plan (the “Post-65 Retiree Plan”) as a
separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the
establishment of the Post-65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post-age
65 retirees and their eligible post-age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post-65 Retiree
Plan, a retiree-only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post-65 Retiree Plan is
not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and
restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the
establishment of the Post-65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement
benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the
legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit
obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets
and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost
for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million.

Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Bill

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on
July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a
Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory
proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to
the SEC and any standard-setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle,
standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over-the-counter derivative
market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring
cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the
Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is
unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these
regulations have been issued.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued)

Competition

Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor-owned, municipal, and cooperative electric
utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas
utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong
competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas.
Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial
markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates
are primarily driven by low-cost, coal-fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas
provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts
market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane-based heating which, over time, has
comprised a declining percentage of the overall market.

Market Conditions

During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas
commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010-2011 have
primarily been in the $3.36 - $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in
the $3.00 - $6.50/Dth range
experienced during the winter of 2009-2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from
the 2009-2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high
levels kept gas prices in a narrow range.

Entering the 2010-2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior
year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged
between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of
2009.

All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state-approved recovery mechanisms that
provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as
pass-through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs
included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the
difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under-recovered or over-recovered gas
cost to be included in future customer billings.

The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non-traditional revenue sources within the
evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream
of the companies’ service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies’ service
territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The
upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution
Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity.
The on-system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the
transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The
incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the
savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its
ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution
Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase
gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions.

The Gas Distribution Operations segment’s capital expenditures and other investing activities were
$409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for
2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on
infrastructure replacement projects. The


ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued)

increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to
additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and
Massachusetts.

Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to
decreased spending on maintenance projects.

Bear Garden Station

In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to
install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA,
known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24-inch steel
pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion
Virginia Power Company’s planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginia’s facilities constructed
to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010.

Regulatory Matters

Refer to Note 8, “Regulatory Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas
Distribution Operations segment.

Customer Usage.

The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by
industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the
LDCs’ operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has
been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in
a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate
proceeding and has adopted a “de-coupled” rate design which more closely links the recovery of
fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and
Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an
approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the
NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such
changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas
distribution utilities.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of
December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions.
Refer to Note 20-D, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment.

Restructuring

Refer to Note 3, “Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives.

Sale of Northern Utilities

On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to
Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in
working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand
customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource
began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a
net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the
Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for
the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to
Note 4, “Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the company’s larger
acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of
Massachusetts as a core component of the company’s long-term, investment-driven growth strategy.

Weather

In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer
demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree-days. Normal is evaluated using
heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for
measuring heating degree-days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load
begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65
degrees. NiSource composite heating degree-days reported do not directly correlate to the weather
related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree-days
experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or
less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed
results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when
there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating
degree-day comparison.

Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than
normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009.

Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was
about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2009 compared to 2008.

Throughput

Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared
to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable
mainly to the improved economy and higher off-system sales.

Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared
to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial
customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economy’s slowdown and lower
off-system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented
fewer opportunities to sell gas to non-traditional customers.

Net Revenues

Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease
in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset
in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there
was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7
million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a
decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather
of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and
service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the
implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohio’s approved infrastructure replacement program,
and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia.

Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase
in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate
cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in
expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0
million, lower off-system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of
approximately $8 million.

At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under
and over-recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are
primarily reflected in the “Other” gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this
segment discussion. The adjustment to “Other” gross revenues for the twelve months ended December
31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1
million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two
years.

Operating Income

For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an
increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower
operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above.
Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of
$20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of
$8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating
expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and
environmental costs of $3.3 million.

For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a
decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher
operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above.
Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million,
increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million,
increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and
increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense
was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of
increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio.

Growth Projects Placed into Service

Cobb Compressor Station Project.

This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations segment strategy to meet producers’ near-term, incremental transportation demand in the
Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately
25,500 Dth per day of long-term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at
Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately
$15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010.

Majorsville, PA Project.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three
separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate
Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and
compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more
than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing
plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C.

In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain
transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed
affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non-FERC
jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three
projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering
and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern
West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009,
which were superseded by the execution of long-term service agreements in August and September
2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver
residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge
compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to
eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011.

Clendenin Project.

Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area
in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project
allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of
up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long-term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been
executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second
quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million.

Projects Placed into Service in 2009.

During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment
placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to
gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March
2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter
of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity
in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia
Transmission’s transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The
Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide
additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding
97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The
Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400
Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth
quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market-based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project
included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity
beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of
30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio
Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis.

Growth Projects in Progress

East Lateral Project.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million
project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral,
allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm
transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five-year terms. Gas
Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into
service on April 1, 2011.

Line WB Expansion Project.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB
system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide
transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion
will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin.
Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity
have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and
received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of
2011.

Southern Appalachian Project.

As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services
to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment
is expanding Line SM-116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This
additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional
facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received
FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011.

Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by
$14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects.
The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be
approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in
Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending
and planned pipeline replacements.

Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by
$96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects.

Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold

Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of
service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and
Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm
contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management
seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts.

Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between
certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a “capacity reservation” fee
based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an
incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from
firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues
are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high
percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue
fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near-term
supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were
derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation
revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts.
This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity
reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage
fees under firm contracts for 2009.

Interruptible transportation service is typically short-term in nature and is generally used by
customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service.
These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to
provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and
customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline
facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive
prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service
is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission
assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation
revenues were derived from interruptible contracts.

Hartsville Compressor Station

In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulf’s Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and
immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while
installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were
settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression
solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally
advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner-burning and

quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were
constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010.
Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, in reconstruction costs.

Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident
totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and
2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages.

Hurricanes

In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property,
including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in
capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair
damages to nearly $59 million over a multi-year period, which were principally capital expenditures
recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or
when information became available to estimate the damages incurred.

Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which
$11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively.
Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement,
operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At
December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental
response actions. Refer to Note 20-D, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations segment.

Sale of Granite State Gas

On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to
Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in
working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that
occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86-mile FERC regulated gas
transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008,
NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As
such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected
the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued
operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from
discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, “Discontinued Operations and Assets and
Liabilities Held for Sale,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.

Restructuring Plan

Refer to Note 3, “Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges,” in the Notes to Consolidated

Throughput

Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers
within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid-Atlantic, midwestern, and
southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists
of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed
throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its
mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipeline’s throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its
customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment
eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

NiSource Inc.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued)

Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010,
compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to
increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on
the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes
comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the
Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area
receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from
Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year.

Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009,
compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia
Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new
Columbia Transmission contracts.

Operating Revenues

Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The
increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues
as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the
recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage
from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally,
there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million
of fees received from a contract buy-out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral
rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter
term
transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral
rights leasing revenues.

Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The
increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5
million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage
Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter-term transportation
and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased
trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of
$9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract
buyouts in 2008.

Operating Income

Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to
increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly
offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result
of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity
management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million,
primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result
of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6
million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially
offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower
environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting
from lower earnings from Columbia Transmission’s investment in Millennium, driven by higher
interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millennium’s August 2010 debt refinancing.

Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to
increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by
an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of
restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues,
higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher
environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset
by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity
earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia
Transmission’s investment in

Electric Supply

On October 29, 2009, Northern Indiana filed its 2009 Integrated Resource Plan with the IURC. The
plan evaluates demand-side and supply-side resource alternatives to reliably and cost-effectively
meet Northern Indiana customers’ future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the
effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to
serve customers’ needs. Therefore, Northern Indiana’s two requests for proposals to secure
additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon.

With
numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near-term outlook, Northern Indiana continues
to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource
plan as appropriate.

On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indiana’s proposed purchase power
agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind-generated power from Iowa and South
Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind
power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal
renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power
purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard.

Market Conditions

Northern Indiana’s mwh sales to the steel-related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and
62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due
to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S.
steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global
and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking
capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel-related mwh volumes and demands
have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008-2009 period and the steel producers
in Northern Indiana Electric’s service territory continue to see
modest increases in production.

The Electric Operations’ capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were
higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to
increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are
projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This
increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects
in the generation fleet.

The Electric Operations’ capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were
lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily
attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008.

Regulatory Matters

Refer to Note 8, “Regulatory Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric
Operations segment.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December
31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to
Note 20-D, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment.

Restructuring

Refer to Note 3, “Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives.

Sales

Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared
to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement
in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in
sales.

Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared
to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a
result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes
sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies’
production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen
growth in its power sales to these customers.

Net Revenues

Electric Operations’ net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from
2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1
million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a
$17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses.
Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off-system sales, including a reduction of
$8.2 million in off-system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in
residential margins of $6.6 million.

Electric Operations’ net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from
2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower
industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues
from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission
allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off-system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net
revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and
lower non-recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million.

At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under
and over-recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are
primarily reflected in the “Other” gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this
segment discussion. The adjustment to “Other”
gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of
$54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively.

Operating Income

Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The
increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by
an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the
result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million
for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation
costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially
offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction
in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower
uncollectible costs.

Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease
in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues
described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative
costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and
maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in
operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower
environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in
employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The
decrease in

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of NiSource Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements of consolidated
long-term debt of NiSource Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
and the related consolidated statements of income, of common stockholders’ equity and comprehensive
income (loss), and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010.
Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in
the Index at   Item 15. These
financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial
statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain a
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also,
in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28,
2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of NiSource Inc.:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of NiSource Inc. and subsidiaries
(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting at Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control
— Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2011
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.

unrealized gain/loss on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, net of $7.6 million tax benefit, $78.3 million tax expense and $94.9 million tax benefit in 2010, 2009, and 2008 . During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its
cash hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.

Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

A.

Company Structure and Principles of Consolidation

.   NiSource, a Delaware corporation, is a
holding company whose subsidiaries provide natural gas, electricity and other products and services
to approximately 3.8 million customers located within a corridor that runs from the Gulf Coast
through the Midwest to New England. NiSource is a holding company under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 2005. NiSource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the
operating results of its fifteen direct subsidiaries.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NiSource and its majority-owned
subsidiaries after the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. Investments for
which at least a 20% interest is owned, certain joint ventures and limited partnership interests of
more than 3% are accounted for under the equity method. Except where noted above and in the event
where NiSource has significant influence, investments with less than a 20% interest are accounted
for under the cost method. NiSource also consolidates variable interest entities for which NiSource
is the primary beneficiary.

At December 31, 2009, certain assets totaling $61.5 million were recorded in “Other property at
cost less accumulated depreciation.” NiSource has corrected the classification of these assets as
“Utility Plant” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.

B.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United
States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

C.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash

.   NiSource considers all investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. NiSource reports amounts deposited in
brokerage accounts for margin requirements as restricted cash. In addition, NiSource has amounts
deposited in trust to satisfy requirements for the provision of various property, liability,
workers compensation, and long-term disability insurance, which is classified as restricted cash
and disclosed as an investing cash flow on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.

Restricted cash was $202.9 million and $174.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. The increase in restricted cash was due primarily to the decline in forward gas
prices which resulted in increased margin deposits on open derivative contracts.

D.

Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenue.

Accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets includes both billed and unbilled amounts as NiSource believes that total accounts
receivable is a more meaningful presentation, given the factors which impact both billed and
unbilled accounts receivable. Unbilled revenue is based on estimated amounts of electric energy or
natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its customers. Unbilled amounts of accounts receivable
relate to a portion of a customer’s consumption of gas or electricity from the date of the last
cycle billing date through the last day of the month (balance sheet date). Factors taken into
consideration when estimating unbilled revenue include historical usage, customer rates and
weather. Accounts receivable fluctuates from year to year depending in large part on weather
impacts and price volatility. NiSource’s accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
includes unbilled revenue, less reserves, in the amounts of $458.6 million and $258.7 million for
the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The reserve for uncollectible
receivables is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing
accounts receivable. The Company determined the reserve based on historical experience and in
consideration of current market conditions. Account balances are charged against the allowance when
it is anticipated the receivable will not be recovered.

E.

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.

NiSource’s investments in debt and equity securities
are carried at fair value and are designated as available-for-sale. These investments are included
within “Other investments” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, net of
deferred income taxes, are


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These investments are monitored for
other than temporary declines in market value. Realized gains and losses and permanent impairments
are reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Income. No material impairment charges were
recorded for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

F.

Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries

.   Rate-regulated subsidiaries account for
and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which
regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing
the regulated service and it is probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain
expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in
income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related
amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers.

In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its
costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the
criteria for regulatory accounting. In such an event, a write-down of all or a portion of
NiSource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery
was approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally
accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during
such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable
amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of regulatory accounting, NiSource would be
required to apply the provisions of Discontinuation of Rate-Regulated Accounting. In management’s
opinion, NiSource’s regulated subsidiaries will be subject to regulatory accounting for the
foreseeable future. Refer to Note 8, “Regulatory Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.

G.

Utility Plant and Other Property and Related Depreciation and Maintenance

.   Property, plant and
equipment (principally utility plant) is stated at cost. The rate-regulated subsidiaries record
depreciation using composite rates on a straight-line basis over the remaining service lives of the
electric, gas and common properties as approved by the appropriate regulators.

The depreciation provisions for utility plant, as a percentage of the original cost, for the
periods ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:




Electric Operations

3.5

%

3.4

%

3.7

%

Gas Distribution and Transmission Operations

2.8

%

2.9

%

2.8

%

For rate-regulated companies, AFUDC is capitalized on all classes of property except organization
costs, land, autos, office equipment, tools and other general property purchases. The allowance is
applied to construction costs for that period of time between the date of the expenditure and the
date on which such project is completed and placed in service. The pre-tax rate for AFUDC was 4.9%
in 2010, 3.8% in 2009 and 3.3% in 2008. Short-term borrowings were primarily used to fund
construction efforts for all three years presented; however, long-term borrowings and equity funds
were used more extensively in 2010 to fund construction than in the comparative periods. The
increase in the 2009 AFUDC rate, as compared with 2008, was due to an increased weighted effect and
use of long-term borrowings and equity funds that more than offset a decrease in short-term
interest rates associated with the amount of short-term borrowings used for construction.

Generally, NiSource’s subsidiaries follow the practice of charging maintenance and repairs,
including the cost of removal of minor items of property, to expense as incurred. When regulated
property that represents a retired unit is replaced or removed, the cost of such property is
credited to utility plant, and such cost, net of salvage, is charged to the accumulated provision
for depreciation in accordance with composite depreciation.

H.

Carrying Charges and Deferred Depreciation.

Upon completion of units 17 and 18 at the R. M.
Schahfer Generating Station, Northern Indiana capitalized the debt-based carrying charges and
deferred depreciation


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

in accordance with orders of the IURC, pending the inclusion of the cost of each unit in rates.
Such carrying charges and deferred depreciation are being amortized over the remaining service life
of each unit.

Northern Indiana has capitalized carrying charges and deferred depreciation and certain operating
expenses relating to its scrubber service agreement for its Bailly Generating Station in accordance
with an order of the IURC. The accumulated balance of the deferred costs and related carrying
charges is being amortized over the remaining life of the scrubber service agreement.

On May 28, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving the purchase of Sugar Creek, and on May 30,
2008 Northern Indiana purchased the 535mw CCGT for $330 million in order to help meet capacity
needs. On February 18, 2009, the IURC issued an order approving a settlement agreement filed in
this proceeding allowing Northern Indiana to begin deferring carrying costs and depreciation on
Sugar Creek, pending inclusion in rates, which occurred effective December 1, 2008, when Sugar
Creek was dispatched into MISO, at the agreed to carrying cost rate of 6.5%. The Sugar Creek
investment was included in rate base as part of the IURC’s August 25, 2010 rate order. Northern
Indiana will continue to defer depreciation expenses and carrying costs associated with the $330.0
million Sugar Creek investment until the IURC approves new customer rates. The annual deferral for
Sugar Creek is reduced by the annual depreciation on the Mitchell plant of $4.5 million, pursuant
to the FAC-71 settlement. The IURC also approved a five year amortization of balances that were
deferred as of December 31, 2009 and such amortization will commence with the IURC’s approval of
new customer rates.

In 2005, the PUCO authorized Columbia of Ohio to revise its depreciation accrual rates for the
period beginning January 1, 2005. The revised depreciation rates are now higher than those which
would have been utilized if Columbia of Ohio were not subject to regulation. The amount of
depreciation that would have been recorded for 2005 through 2010 had Columbia of Ohio not been
subject to rate regulation is a combined $232.4 million, a $35.0 million decrease over the $267.4
million reflected in rates. The regulatory asset was $96.6 million and $102.3 million as of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The amount of depreciation that would have been recorded
for 2010 had Columbia of Ohio not been subject to rate regulation is $48.9 million, a $5.6 million
decrease over the $54.5 million reflected in rates.

I.

Amortization of Software Costs.

External and internal costs associated with computer software
developed for internal use are capitalized. Capitalization of such costs commences upon the
completion of the preliminary stage of each project. Once the installed software is ready for its
intended use, such capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis generally over a period
of five years. NiSource amortized $25.9 million in 2010, $27.7 million in 2009 and $23.1 million
in 2008 related to software costs. NiSource’s unamortized software balance was $99.0 million and
$100.5 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

J.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

NiSource has approximately $4.0 billion in goodwill and
other intangible assets. Substantially all goodwill relates to the excess of cost over the fair
value of the net assets acquired in the Columbia acquisition. In addition, NiSource has other
intangible assets consisting primarily of franchise rights apart from goodwill that were identified
as part of the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisition of Columbia of
Massachusetts, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NiSource, which is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over forty years from the date of acquisition. Refer to Note 6, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

K.

Long-lived Assets.

NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets contain significant long-lived
assets other than goodwill and intangible assets discussed above which are not subject to recovery
under regulatory accounting. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential
earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value could be impaired. Refer to Note 3, “Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges,” in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

L.

Revenue Recognition.

Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility
revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual
basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in
advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and
recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. For
shorter

term transportation and storage service revenues, cash is received at inception of the service
period resulting in the recording of deferred revenues that are recognized in revenues over the
period the services are provided.

M.

Earnings Per Share.

Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders
by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The weighted
average shares outstanding for diluted EPS include the incremental effects of the various long-term
incentive compensation plans and the Forward Agreements (see Note 14). The calculation of diluted
earnings per share for 2010, 2009, and 2008 excludes out-of-the-money stock options that had an
anti-dilutive effect.

The numerator in calculating both basic and diluted EPS for each year is reported net income. The
computation of diluted average common shares follows:

N.

Estimated Rate Refunds

.   Certain rate-regulated subsidiaries collect revenues subject to
refund pending final determination in rate proceedings. In connection with such revenues,
estimated rate refund liabilities are recorded which reflect management’s current judgment of
the ultimate outcomes of the proceedings. No provisions are made when, in the opinion of
management, the facts and circumstances preclude a reasonable estimate of the outcome.

O.

Accounts Receivable Transfer Program.

Certain of NiSource’s subsidiaries entered into
agreements with third parties to sell certain accounts receivable without recourse. These sales
were reflected as reductions of accounts receivable in the December 31, 2009 Consolidated Balance
Sheet and as operating cash flows in the December 31, 2009 Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows.
The costs of these programs, which were based upon the purchasers’ level of investment and
borrowing costs, were charged to Other, net in the December 31, 2009 Statement of Consolidated
Income. Beginning January 1, 2010 transfers of accounts receivable that previously qualified for
sale accounting, no longer qualify and are accounted for as secured borrowings. The entire gross
receivables balance remains on the December 31, 2010 Consolidated Balance Sheet and short-term debt
is recorded in the amount of proceeds received from the commercial paper conduits involved in the
transactions. Fees associated with the securitization transactions are recorded as interest
expense in accordance with the new accounting guidance. Refer to Note 19, “Transfers of Financial
Assets,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

P.

Fuel Adjustment Clause.

All metered electric rates contain a provision for adjustment to
reflect increases and decreases in the cost of fuel and the fuel cost of purchased power through
operation of a FAC. As prescribed by order of the IURC applicable to metered retail rates, the
adjustment factor has been calculated based on the estimated cost of fuel and the fuel cost of
purchased power in a future three-month period. If two statutory requirements relating to expense
and return levels are satisfied, any under-recovery or over-recovery caused by variances between
estimated and actual costs in a given three-month period are recorded as adjustments to revenue and
will be included in a future filing, provided that the purchased power benchmark has not been
exceeded. Northern Indiana records any under-recovery or over-recovery as a current regulatory
asset or liability until such time as it is billed or refunded to its customers. The fuel
adjustment factor is subject to a quarterly review by the IURC and remains in effect for a
three-month period.


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Q.

Gas Cost Adjustment Clause.

All of NiSource’s Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries defer
most differences between gas purchase costs and the recovery of such costs in revenues, and adjust
future billings for such deferrals on a basis consistent with applicable state-approved tariff
provisions.

R.

Gas Inventory.

Both the LIFO inventory methodology and the weighted average cost methodology
are used to value natural gas in storage, as approved by state regulators for each of NiSource’s
regulated subsidiaries. Inventory valued using LIFO was $151.6 million and $313.8 million at
December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Based on the average cost of gas using the LIFO method,
the estimated replacement cost of gas in storage at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009,
exceeded the stated LIFO cost by $91.7 million and $295.4 million, respectively. Inventory valued
using the weighted average cost methodology was $146.6 million at December 31, 2010 and $71.0
million at December 31, 2009.

S.

Accounting for Exchange and Balancing Arrangements of Natural Gas.

NiSource’s Gas Transmission
and Storage and Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries enter into balancing and exchange
arrangements of natural gas as part of their operations and off-system sales programs. NiSource
records a receivable or payable for their respective cumulative gas imbalances and for any gas
inventory borrowed or lent under an exchange agreement for Gas Distribution Operations. These
receivables and payables are recorded as “Exchange gas receivable” or “Exchange gas payable” on
NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, as appropriate.

T.

Accounting for Emissions Allowances.

Northern Indiana has obtained SO2 and NOx emissions
allowances from the EPA based upon its electric generation operations that the utility may sell,
trade or hold for future use. Northern Indiana utilizes the inventory model in accounting for
these emissions allowances, whereby these allowances were recognized at zero cost upon receipt from
the EPA. Proceeds received from the annual EPA auction of allowances and through the utilization
of allowances in the generation of power for off-system sales are deferred as regulatory
liabilities. The sale of other allowances, not used due to investments made by NiSource in
pollution control assets and services, are reflected in earnings in the period in which they occur
and are included in net cash flows from operating activities in NiSource’s Statements of
Consolidated Cash Flows.

U.

Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities.

NiSource accounts for its
derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with ASC 815. NiSource recognizes all derivatives
as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, unless such
contracts are exempted as a normal purchase normal sale under the provisions of the standard. The
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the
derivative and resulting designation. Refer to Note 9, “Risk Management and Energy Marketing
Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

V.

Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits.

NiSource records income taxes to recognize full
interperiod tax allocations. Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are provided for
the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to
future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of
existing assets and liabilities. Previously recorded investment tax credits of the regulated
subsidiaries were deferred on the balance sheet and are being amortized to book income over the
regulatory life of the related properties to conform to regulatory policy.

To the extent certain deferred income taxes of the regulated companies are recoverable or payable
through future rates, regulatory assets and liabilities have been established. Regulatory assets
for income taxes are primarily attributable to property related tax timing differences for which
deferred taxes had not been provided in the past, when regulators did not recognize such taxes as
costs in the rate-making process. Regulatory liabilities for income taxes are primarily
attributable to the regulated companies’ obligation to refund to ratepayers deferred income taxes
provided at rates higher than the current federal income tax rate. Such amounts are credited to
ratepayers using either the average rate assumption method or the reverse South Georgia method.

Pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code and relevant state taxing authorities, NiSource and its
subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns for federal and certain state jurisdictions.
NiSource and its subsidiaries are parties


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

to an agreement (Tax Allocation Agreement) that provides for the allocation of consolidated tax
liabilities. The Tax Allocation Agreement generally provides that each party is allocated an
amount of tax similar to that which would be owed had the party been separately subject to tax.
Any net benefit attributable to the parent is reallocated to other members.

W.

Environmental Expenditures.

NiSource accrues for costs associated with environmental
remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs is probable and the amounts can be
reasonably estimated, regardless of when the expenditures are actually made. The undiscounted
estimated future expenditures are based on currently enacted laws and regulations, existing
technology and estimated site-specific costs where assumptions may be made about the nature and
extent of site contamination, the extent of cleanup efforts, costs of alternative cleanup methods
and other variables. The liability is adjusted as further information is discovered or
circumstances change. The reserves for estimated environmental expenditures are recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets in “Legal and environmental reserves” for short-term portions of these
liabilities and “Other noncurrent liabilities” for the respective long-term portions of these
liabilities. Rate-regulated subsidiaries applying regulatory accounting establish regulatory
assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the extent that future recovery of environmental
remediation costs is probable through the regulatory process.

In addition, Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC in 2003 to recover costs associated
with environmental compliance programs for NOx pollution-reduction equipment at Northern Indiana’s
generating stations. Refer to Note 20, “Other Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

X.

Excise Taxes.

NiSource accounts for excise taxes that are customer liabilities by separately
stating on its invoices the tax to its customers and recording amounts invoiced as liabilities
payable to the applicable taxing jurisdiction. These types of taxes, comprised largely of sales
taxes collected, are presented on a net basis affecting neither revenues nor cost of sales.
NiSource accounts for other taxes for which it is liable by recording a liability for the expected
tax with a corresponding charge to “Other taxes” expense.

2.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.

In April 2009, the FASB provided additional guidance for
estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have
significantly decreased. The additional guidance was effective for interim reporting periods
ending after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted. NiSource adopted the additional
guidance on April 1, 2009. As the guidance provides only disclosure requirements, the application
of this ASC topic did not impact the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 18, “Fair
Value Disclosures,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In August 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance clarifying the measurement of the fair value
of a liability in circumstances when a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability
is not available. The guidance emphasizes that entities should maximize the use of observable
inputs in the absence of quoted prices when measuring the fair value of liabilities. This guidance
became effective on October 1, 2009.

In September 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that provides further clarification for
measuring the fair value of investments in entities that meet the FASB’s definition of an
investment company. This guidance permits a company to estimate the fair value of an investment
using the net asset value per share of the investment if the net asset value is determined in
accordance with the FASB’s guidance for investment companies as of the company’s measurement date.
This creates a practical expedient to determining a fair value estimate and certain attributes of
the investment (such as redemption restrictions) will not be considered in measuring fair value.
Additionally, companies with investments within the scope of this guidance must disclose additional
information related to the nature and risks of the investments. This guidance is effective as of
December 31, 2009 and is required to be applied prospectively. NiSource has alternative
investments that are within the scope of this guidance. However, the
fair


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

value of the alternative investments is already determined based on the net asset values per fund.
The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amends the disclosures about transfers
into and out of Levels 1 and 2 and requires separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances,
and settlements relating to Level 3 measurements. This guidance also clarifies existing fair value
disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to
measure fair value. This guidance is effective for the first reporting period, including interim
periods, beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to provide Level 3 activity
of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, which will be effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. NiSource has adopted
the required guidance for all periods presented.

Refer to Note 18, “Fair Value Disclosures,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information including the impact of the adoption.

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance
to amend the manner in which entities evaluate whether consolidation is required for VIEs. The
model for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest and is the primary
beneficiary of a VIE has changed significantly under the new guidance. Previously, variable
interest holders were required to determine whether they retained a controlling financial interest
in a VIE based on a quantitative analysis of the expected gains and/or losses of the entity. In
contrast, the new guidance requires an enterprise with a variable interest in a VIE to
qualitatively assess whether it has a controlling financial interest in the entity, and if so,
whether it is the primary beneficiary. Furthermore, this guidance requires that companies
continually evaluate VIEs for consolidation, rather than assessing based upon the occurrence of
triggering events. This revised guidance also requires enhanced disclosures about how a company’s
involvement with a VIE affects its financial statements and exposure to risks. NiSource adopted the
guidance on January 1, 2010. Refer to Note 10, “Variable Interest Entities and Equity
Investments,” for additional information including the impact of adoption.

Transfer of Financial Assets.

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to amend
derecognition criteria guidance in ASC 860 to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness,
and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements
about a transfer of financial assets; the effects of a transfer on its financial position,
financial performance, and cash flows; and a transferor’s continuing involvement, if any, in
transferred financial assets. NiSource adopted the guidance on January 1, 2010. This guidance
requires transfers of accounts receivable that previously qualified for sales accounting to be
accounted for as secured borrowings resulting in the recognition of short-term debt on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 19, “Transfers of Financial Assets,” for additional
information including the impact of adoption.

3.

Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges

Impairments.

An impairment loss shall be recognized only if the carrying amount of a long lived
asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The test compares the carrying amount of the
long lived asset to the fair value of the assets sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to
result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.

Lake Erie Land, which is wholly-owned by NiSource and within the company’s Corporate and Other
Segment, was in the process of selling real estate over a 10-year period as a part of an agreement
reached in June 2006 with a private real estate development group. In the second quarter of 2009,
the developer was unable to meet certain contractual obligations under the sale agreement.
NiSource granted a limited extension for the developer to meet its contractual obligations and
began negotiations with another potential buyer to replace the original developer under the
existing agreement. In July 2009, NiSource signed a letter of intent with the new potential buyer
which was reaffirmed in October 2009. However, in the fourth quarter of 2009, an agreement was not
reached for the sale of the real estate as was previously expected, and a sale within the next
twelve months is no longer probable. As such,


ITEM 8.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

certain real estate assets previously classified as held for sale were reclassified and were no
longer reflected as held for sale as of December 31, 2009. Concurrent with the determination that
it was not probable that the original developer would execute the future sales under the existing
agreement and a new developer would not replace the original developer, NiSource tested the assets
for impairment. The company compared the carrying value of the assets to the fair value,
determined primarily through independent appraisals, and recorded an impairment loss of $16.6
million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The total impairment charge is comprised of $8.8 million
recognized due to the uncollectability of certain receivables (see below for more information) due
from the acquirer of the property and $7.8 million due to the current book value exceeding the fair
value of certain real estate property remaining to be sold under the installment sales agreement as
of December 31, 2009. The book value of the impaired assets at December 31, 2009, subsequent to
the impairment charge, was $27.0 million. No material additional impairment charges were recorded
during 2010.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the financing receivables noted above were recorded at fair value of
$6.5 million. No events occurred during 2010 that indicated the fair value of the receivables had
significantly changed during the year.

During 2009, NiSource recognized $4.4 million in expense for an impairment charge related to the
four properties NDC Douglas Properties owns which do not currently meet the assets held for sale
criteria as their estimated sale date is greater than one year. Based on previous impairments
recorded on other NDC Douglas Properties, the properties were tested for impairment during the
third quarter of 2009. NDC Douglas Properties property, plant, and equipment assets were valued
based on a discounted cash flow model utilizing estimated future cash flows. The book value of
these assets at December 31, 2009, subsequent to the impairment charge, was $7.0 million. NiSource
conducted similar impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2010, and recorded an impairment
charge of $0.3 million.

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, NiSource recognized $1.4 million, $0.2 million and $3.4 million,
respectively, in expense for the impairment of the Marble Cliff facility discussed in Note 4,
“Discontinued Operation and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale.”

Restructuring

.   During the first quarter of 2009, NiSource began an organizational restructuring
initiative, beginning with Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, in response to the decline in
overall economic conditions.

In February 2009, NiSource announced the restructuring of the Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations segment. NiSource has eliminated positions across the 16 state operating territory of
Gas Transmission and Storage. The reductions have occurred through voluntary programs and
involuntary separations. In addition to employee reductions, the Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations segment took steps to achieve additional cost savings by efficiently managing its
various business locations, reducing its fleet operations, creating alliances with third party
service providers, and implementing other changes in line with its strategic plan for growth and
maximizing value of existing assets. During 2009, NiSource recorded pre-tax restructuring charges
of $19.9 million to “Operation and maintenance” expense on the Statement of Consolidated Income,
which primarily includes costs related to severance and other employee related costs. No additional
material charges have been recorded since the initial restructuring charge in the first quarter of
2009. The restructuring program was substantially completed in 2009.

In September 2009, NiSource announced the restructuring of Northern Indiana, which aims to redefine
business and operations strategies and achieve cost reductions, and impacts both Electric
Operations and Gas Distribution Operations. During 2009, NiSource recorded a pre-tax restructuring
charge related to this initiative, net of adjustments, of $5.4 million, which primarily includes
costs related to severance and other employee related costs and outside service costs. The initial
restructuring charge consisted of a $3.7 million and $1.7 million expense to the Electric and Gas
Distributions Operations’ segments, respectively. During 2010, NiSource recorded a pre-tax
restructuring charge related to this initiative of $1.1 million to “Operation and maintenance”
expense on the Statements of Consolidated Income, which primarily includes costs related to outside
service costs. The restructuring program was completed in December 2010.

Assets classified as discontinued operations or held for sale are no longer depreciated.

NiSource Corporate Services continues its effort to sell its Marble Cliff facility. In March 2006,
the facility was recorded as an asset held for sale of $12.7 million. Impairment charges recorded
in 2007, 2008 and 2010 brought the value of the asset held for sale to $5.6 million at December 31,
2010. See Note 3, “Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges” for further discussion. In the
fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource Corporate Services executed a purchase and sale agreement of the
Marble Cliff facility with the closing date planned in the first quarter 2011.

NDC Douglas Properties, a subsidiary of NiSource Development Company, is in the process of exiting
some of its low income housing investments. In 2009, based on the expected proceeds from the sale
of the five properties being less than the net book value, an impairment charge of $2.7 million,
net of tax, was included in Loss on Disposition of Discontinued Operations in the Statement of
Consolidated Income for the year ended December 31, 2009. Three of these properties were sold
during the first quarter 2010 and two of these properties remained classified as assets and
liabilities held for sale. Results of operations and cash flows for these properties remained
classified as discontinued operations. Upon sale of three of the properties in the first quarter
of 2010, a gain on sale of $0.1 million, net of taxes, was recorded in Discontinued Operations.
During the second quarter of 2010, it was determined that the remaining properties no longer met
the criteria as “assets held for sale” as NiSource could no longer assert that a sale would take
place within the next twelve months. As such, the assets and liabilities were reclassified to
assets held and used. Additionally, the results of operations and cash flows were reclassified to
continuing operations for all periods presented. These reclassifications did not have a
significant impact on overall results of NiSource.

On June 18, 2009, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to abandon by sale to an
unaffiliated third party its Line R System in West Virginia, which includes certain natural gas
pipeline and compression facilities. Through subsequent negotiations with this third party,
certain compression facilities will not be sold and, therefore, have been moved to assets held for
use at their current net book value adjusted for depreciation. The assets were determined to have
little or no future use and were retired. Assets held for sale have a net book value of $2.1
million. The sale transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2011.

On December 1, 2008, NiSource sold its subsidiaries Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to
Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million which included $49.1 million in
working capital. Under the terms of the transaction, Unitil Corporation acquired Northern
Utilities, a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in
Maine and New Hampshire and Granite State Gas, an 86-mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline
primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, an
after tax loss of $0.2 million and $75.8 million, respectively, was included in Loss on Disposition
of Discontinued Operations in the Statements of Consolidated Income.

On June 30, 2008, NiSource sold Whiting Clean Energy to BPAE for $216.7 million, which included
$16.1 million in working capital. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the
operations of Whiting Clean Energy as discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31,
2008, an after tax loss of $32.3 million was included in Loss on Disposition of Discontinued
Operations in the Statements of Consolidated Income.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with the provisions for goodwill accounting as issued by the FASB, NiSource tests its
goodwill for impairment annually as of June 30 each year unless indicators, events, or
circumstances would require an immediate review. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a level of
reporting referred to as a reporting unit, which generally is an operating segment or a component
of an operating segment as defined by the FASB. In accordance with the provision, certain
components of an operating segment with similar economic characteristics are aggregated and deemed
a single reporting unit. Goodwill is generally allocated to the reporting units based upon the
amounts allocated at the time of their respective acquisition. The goodwill impairment test is a
two-step process which requires NiSource to make estimates regarding the fair value of the
reporting unit. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential
impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including
goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the
reporting unit is considered not impaired, thus the second step of the impairment test is not
required. However, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second
step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss (if
any), which compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of
that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an
impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

NiSource has four reporting units that carry or are allocated goodwill. NiSource’s goodwill assets
at December 31, 2010 were $3.7 billion pertaining primarily to the acquisition of Columbia on
November 1, 2000. Of this amount, approximately $2.0 billion is allocated to Columbia Transmission
Operations (which is comprised of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf) and $1.7 billion is
allocated to Columbia Distribution Operations (which is

comprised of Columbia of Kentucky, Columbia of Maryland, Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania
and Columbia of Virginia). In addition, the goodwill balances at December 31, 2010 for Northern
Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas were $13.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively.

In estimating the fair value of the Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution
Operations reporting units for the June 30, 2010 test, NiSource used a weighted average of the
income and market approaches. The income approach utilized a discounted cash flow model. This
model is based on management’s short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance for each
reporting unit. The two main assumptions used in the models are the growth rates, which are based
on the cash flow from operations for each of the reporting units, and the weighted average cost of
capital, or discount rate. The starting point for each reporting unit’s cash flow from operations
is the detailed five year plan, which takes into consideration a variety of factors such as the
current economic environment, industry trends, and specific operating goals set by management. The
discount rates are based on trends in overall market as well as industry specific variables and
include components such as the risk-free rate, cost of debt, and company volatility at June 30,
2010. Under the market approach, NiSource utilized three market-based models to estimate the fair
value of the reporting units: (i) the comparable company multiples method, which estimated fair
value of each reporting unit by analyzing EBITDA multiples of a peer group of publicly traded
companies and applying that multiple to the reporting unit’s EBITDA, (ii) the comparable
transactions method, which valued the reporting unit based on observed EBITDA multiples from
completed transactions of peer companies and applying that multiple to the reporting unit’s EBITDA,
and (iii) the market capitalization method, which used the NiSource share price and allocated
NiSource’s total market capitalization among both the goodwill and non-goodwill reporting units
based on the relative EBITDA, revenues, and operating income of each reporting unit. Each of the
three market approaches were calculated using multiples and assumptions inherent in today’s market.
The degree of judgment involved and reliability of inputs into each model were considered in
weighting the various approaches. The resulting estimate of fair value of the reporting units,
using the weighted average of the income and market approaches, exceeded their carrying values,
indicating that no impairment exists under Step 1 of the annual impairment test.

Certain key assumptions used in determining the fair values of the reporting units included planned
operating results, discount rates and the long-term outlook for growth. NiSource used discount
rates of 4.76% and 4.74% for Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations,
respectively. Management also performed a sensitivity analysis using discount rates of 5.78% and
5.76% for Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, respectively.
Using the discount rates of 4.76% and 4.74% for Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia
Distribution Operations, respectively, the excess fair values were approximately $2.6 billion and
$4.2 billion, respectively. If the discount rates were increased to 5.78% and 5.76% for Columbia
Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, respectively, the excess fair value
of the reporting units would be approximately $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. Under
either discount rate scenario, the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units
passed step one of the impairment test.

Goodwill related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $13.3
million and $5.5 million, respectively, was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2010 using an
income approach to determine the fair value of each of these reporting units. A discount rate
range of 4.74% to 5.76% and growth rates factoring in the regulatory environment and growth
initiatives for each reporting unit were the significant assumptions used in determining the fair
values using the income approach. The step one goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value
of each of these reporting units exceeding the carrying value. Using the discount rates of 4.74%
and 5.76% for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light, the excess fair value was $26.1 million and $7.3
million, respectively. Using the discount rates of 4.74% and 5.76% for Kokomo Gas, the excess fair
value was $18.6 million and $9.7 million, respectively.

NiSource considered whether there were any events or changes in circumstances during the second
half of 2010 that would reduce the fair value of any of the reporting units below their carrying
amounts and necessitate another goodwill impairment test. No such indicators were noted that would
require goodwill impairment testing during the second half of 2010.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NiSource’s intangible assets, apart from goodwill, consist of franchise rights, which were
identified as part of the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisition in February
1999 of Columbia of Massachusetts. These amounts were $308.6 million and $319.6 million, net of
accumulated amortization of $133.6 million and $122.6 million, at December 31, 2010, and 2009,
respectively and are being amortized over forty years from the date of acquisition. NiSource
recorded amortization expense of $11.0 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008 related to its intangible
assets.

NiSource has recognized asset retirement obligations associated with various obligations including
costs to remove and dispose of certain construction materials located within many of NiSource’s
facilities, certain costs to retire pipeline, removal costs for certain underground storage tanks,
removal of certain pipelines known to contain PCB contamination, closure costs for certain sites
including ash ponds, solid waste management units, a landfill, as well as some other nominal asset
retirement obligations. NiSource recognizes that there are obligations to incur significant costs
to retire wells associated with gas storage operations; however, the lives of these wells are
indeterminable. Additionally, NiSource has a significant obligation associated with the
decommissioning of its two hydro facilities located in Indiana. These hydro facilities have an
indeterminate life, and no asset retirement obligation has been recorded.

Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and
collected in the service rates of the rate-regulated subsidiaries are classified as regulatory
liabilities and other removal costs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Gas Distribution Operations annual cut and cap additions and settlements for its pipe system for
2010 were $1.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively. In 2010, Northern Indiana reevaluated the
estimated useful lives and costs for electric generating stations which resulted in a reduction in
the present value of estimated cash flows of $4.0 million. Northern Indiana performed activities
associated with asbestos removal resulting in settlements of $1.4 million in 2010 and also recorded
additions of $2.3 million related to underground gas storage wells whose lives became determinable.
Gas Transmission and Storage recorded settlements of $5.0 million, primarily attributable to the
retirement of certain pipeline assets.

Gas Distributions Operations annual cut and cap additions and settlements for its pipe system for
2009 were $6.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively. Northern Indiana performed retirement
activities associated with a landfill and asbestos removal resulting in settlements of $1.0 million
for 2009. Northern Indiana also recorded additions of $2.0 million for 2009 related to landfill
activities.

Regulatory Matters

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

NiSource follows the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 980, which provides that
regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic
effect of regulatory rate-making procedures if the rates established are designed to recover the
costs of providing the regulated service and it is probable that such rates can be charged and
collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination
normally reflected in income or expense are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in the
income statement as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or
refunded to customers.

In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its
costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the
criteria for regulatory accounting. In such event, a write-down of all or a portion of NiSource’s
existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery was approved
by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted
accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such
recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable
amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of regulatory accounting, NiSource would be
required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980-20,

Regulatory assets, including underrecovered gas and fuel cost, of approximately $1,870.8 million as
of December 31, 2010 are not earning a return on investment. Regulatory assets of approximately
$1,602.5 million include expenses that are recovered as components of the cost of service and are
covered by regulatory orders. These costs are recovered over a remaining life of up to 43 years.
Regulatory assets of approximately $335.4 million require specific rate action.

As noted below, regulatory assets for which costs have been incurred or accrued are included (or
expected to be included, for costs incurred subsequent to the most recently approved rate case) in
certain companies’ rate base, thereby providing a return on invested costs. Certain regulatory
assets do not result from cash expenditures and therefore do not represent investments included in
rate base or have offsetting liabilities that reduce rate base.

Assets:

Reacquisition premium on debt –

The unamortized premiums for debt redeemed by Northern Indiana are

Unrecognized pension benefit and other postretirement benefit costs –

In 2007, NiSource adopted
certain updates of ASC 715 which required, among other things, the recognition in other
comprehensive income or loss of the actuarial gains or losses and the prior service costs that
arise during the period but that are not immediately recognized as components of net periodic
benefit costs. Certain subsidiaries defer the costs as a regulatory asset in accordance with
regulatory orders or as a result of regulatory precedent, to be recovered through base rates.

Other postretirement costs –

Primarily comprised of the transition obligation recorded with the
adoption of ASC 715 and ASC 712, as well as other costs approved through rate orders to be
collected through future base rates, revenue riders or tracking mechanisms.

Environmental costs –

Includes certain recoverable costs of investigating, testing, remediating
and other costs related to gas plant sites, disposal sites or other sites onto which material may
have been migrated. Certain companies defer the costs as a regulatory asset in accordance with
regulatory orders, to be recovered in future base rates, revenue riders or tracking mechanisms.

Regulatory effects of accounting for income taxes –

Represents the deferral and under collection
of deferred taxes in the rate making process. In prior years, NiSource has lowered customer rates
in certain jurisdictions for the benefits of accelerated tax deductions. Amounts are expensed for
financial reporting purposes, as NiSource recovers deferred taxes in the rate making process.

Underrecovered gas and fuel costs –

Represents the difference between the costs of gas and fuel
and the recovery of such costs in revenue, and is used to adjust future billings for such deferrals
on a basis consistent with applicable state-approved tariff provisions. Recovery of these costs is
achieved through tracking mechanisms.

Depreciation –

Relates to the difference between the depreciation methodology required by Columbia
of Ohio due to a regulatory order and the deprecation methodology used in accordance with GAAP.
Also included is depreciation associated with the rider IRP program. Recovery of these costs is
achieved through base rates and rider mechanisms.

Uncollectible accounts receivable deferred for future recovery –

Represents the difference between
commodity gas costs of total uncollectible expense and the recovery of such costs to be collected
through cost tracking mechanisms per regulatory orders.

Percentage of Income Plan –

Represents the difference between costs incurred under a customer
assistance program by Columbia of Ohio for targeted low income customers and the recovery of such
costs through cost tracking mechanisms per regulatory orders.

Asset Retirement Obligations –

Represents the timing difference between expense recognition for
future obligations and current recovery in rates.

Derivatives –

Certain companies are permitted by regulatory orders to participate in commodity
price programs to protect customers against the volatility of commodity prices. Unrealized and
realized gains or losses related to NiSource’s commodity price risk programs may be deferred per
specific orders and the recovery of changes in fair value is dependent upon the individual specific
company’s cost recovery or sharing mechanisms in place. Amounts for derivative gains and losses
will continue to be deferred as long as the programs are in existence.

Post-in service carrying charges –

Columbia of Ohio has approval from the PUCO by regulatory order
to defer debt-based post-in service carrying charges as a regulatory asset for future recovery. As
such, Columbia of Ohio capitalizes a carrying charge on eligible property, plant and equipment from
the time it is placed into utility service until recovery of the property, plant and equipment is
included in customer rates in base rates or through a rider mechanism. Inclusion in customer rates
generally occurs when Columbia of Ohio files its next rate proceeding following the in-service date
of the property, plant and equipment.

EERM operation and maintenance and depreciation deferral –

Northern Indiana obtained approval from
the IURC to recover certain environmental related costs including operation and maintenance and
depreciation expense once the environmental facilities become operational. Recovery of these costs
will continue until such assets are included in rate base through an electric base rate case. The
EERM deferred charges represent expenses that will be recovered from customers through an annual
EERM Cost Tracker which authorizes the collection of deferred balances over a twelve month period.

MISO –

As part of Northern Indiana’s participation in the MISO transmission service, wholesale
energy and ancillary service markets, certain administrative fees and non-fuel costs have been
deferred. The IURC authorized the deferral of certain non-fuel related costs. Northern Indiana
will continue to defer such amounts until new

electric rates are implemented. Upon implementation of new electric rates, amortization of this
regulatory asset will commence.

Sugar Creek carrying charges and deferred depreciation –

The IURC approved the deferral of
debt-based carrying charges and depreciation expense for the Sugar Creek assets. Northern Indiana
will continue to defer such amounts until new electric rates are approved and implemented. Upon
implementation of new electric rates, amortization of this regulatory asset will commence.

Liabilities:

Overrecovered gas and fuel costs –

Represents the difference between the costs of gas and fuel and
the recovery of such costs in revenues, and is the basis to adjust future billings for such
recoveries on a basis consistent with applicable state-approved tariff provisions. Refunding of
these revenues is achieved through tracking mechanisms.

Asset retirement obligations –

Represents the timing difference between expense recognition for
current obligations and past recovery in rates.

Cost of Removal –

Represents anticipated costs of removal that have been, and continue to be,
included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of the rate-regulated
subsidiaries for future costs to be incurred.

Regulatory effects of accounting for income taxes –

Represents amounts owed to customers for
deferred taxes collected at a higher rate than the current statutory rates and liabilities
associated with accelerated tax deductions owed to customers that are established during the rate
making process.

Unrecognized pension benefit and other postretirement benefit revenues –

In 2007, NiSource adopted
certain updates of ASC 715 which required, among other things, the recognition in other
comprehensive income or loss of the actuarial gains or losses and the prior service costs that
arise during the period but that are not immediately recognized as components of net periodic
benefit costs. Certain subsidiaries defer the gains as a regulatory liability in accordance with
regulatory orders or as a result of regulatory precedent, to be refunded through base rates.

Percentage of Income Plan –

Represents the difference between costs incurred under a customer
assistance program by Columbia of Ohio for targeted low income customers and the recovery of such
costs through cost tracking mechanisms per regulatory orders. For 2010, Columbia of Ohio is in an
overcollected position for these programs, resulting in a regulatory liability to be refunded
through future billings.

Off-system sales margin sharing –

As a result of a negotiated agreement between NiSource utilities
and their regulators, revenue generated from off-system sales and capacity release programs are
subject to incentive sharing mechanism in which NiSource shares a defined percentage of its margins
with customers

.

Refunding of these revenues is achieved through rate refund mechanisms.

Emission allowances –

Represents proceeds from the banked emission allowances sold into the EPA
auction market and the fair value of emission allowances used in connection with power produced to
generate off-system sales.

Derivatives –

Certain companies are permitted by regulatory orders to participate in commodity
price programs to protect customers against the volatility of commodity prices. Unrealized and
realized gains or losses related to NiSource’s commodity price risk programs may be deferred per
specific orders and the recovery of changes in fair value is dependent upon the individual specific
company’s cost recovery or sharing mechanisms in place. Amounts for derivative gains and losses
will continue to be deferred as long as the programs are in existence.

Gas Distribution Operations Regulatory Matters

Significant Rate Developments

. On January 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate
case with the Pennsylvania PUC, seeking a revenue increase of approximately $37.8 million annually,
and seeking to implement a levelized distribution charge for its residential class that would
mitigate revenue volatility associated with

volumetric rates and provide residential customers with clear price signals. Columbia of
Pennsylvania expects that the Pennsylvania PUC will issue an order in the third or fourth quarter
of 2011 with rates going into effect in the fourth quarter.

On November 30, 2010, Columbia of Ohio filed a notice of intent to file an application to adjust
rates associated with Rider IRP and Rider DSM. Columbia of Ohio will file its application by
February 28, 2011. The application will seek to increase the annual revenue from the riders by
approximately $25.2 million.

On September 29, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed tariff modifications with the Pennsylvania
PUC, seeking permission to apply a BTU content billing adjustment to customers’ metered volumetric
consumption. The filing seeks to account for high BTU content gas that is produced from Marcellus
Shale, which burns hotter than gas from other sources, resulting in lower volumes than assumed in
the design of the company’s rates. The proposed billing adjustment is designed to produce revenues
reflective of the BTU content underlying the demand forecast in the design of Columbia of
Pennsylvania’s most recently approved base rates. If the billing adjustment had been in place for
the twelve months ended June 30, 2010, it would have produced revenues of approximately $3.7
million. By an Order entered on January 26, 2011, the Pennsylvania PUC consolidated this matter
with Columbia of Pennsylvania’s base rate case filed on January 14, 2011, as described above.

On September 7, 2010, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO requesting authority to
reduce its PIPP rider rate by $0.4215 per Mcf. The application was deemed approved on October 26,
2010, and Columbia of Ohio began billing the new rate effective with bills rendered on and after
October 27, 2010. This resulted in a reduction in revenue of approximately $70.7 million and a
corresponding reduction in expense of the same amount to better match current costs and revenues.
As a result, this filing does not impact Columbia of Ohio’s operating income, but does reduce
future cash inflows.

On May 3, 2010, Northern Indiana filed a natural gas rate case with the IURC. Northern Indiana
entered into a comprehensive settlement with all parties on August 24, 2010. The Settlement
Agreement was approved in entirety by Order issued on November 4, 2010 and new rates were placed
into effect November 5, 2010. The order resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately $14.9
million when compared to a normalized test year ended December 31, 2009. The IURC authorized
Northern Indiana to increase the monthly fixed charge for residential customers from $6.36 to
$11.00. The IURC also approved revised depreciation accrual rates for gas plant and authorized
Northern Indiana to reduce current period gas plant depreciation expense by up to $25.7 million
annually for the next four years or until further order of the IURC, whichever occurs first.

On September 1, 2010 Northern Indiana, NIFL and Kokomo filed to merge into one company (Northern
Indiana). NIFL and Kokomo also filed rate proceedings on September 1, 2010. On February 23, 2011,
a stipulation and settlement agreement was filed  that provides for the merger and settlement of the
rate proceedings. The settlement stipulates that all of Northern Indiana’s existing services,
rates and charges will be applicable in the former NIFL and Kokomo territories, including one
unified Gas Cost Adjustment mechanism. The application of Northern Indiana’s rates in the former
NIFL and Kokomo territories will result in a decrease in revenue of approximately $0.8 million,
when compared to a normalized test year ended March 31, 2010. This is primarily offset by
reductions in depreciation expense. A settlement hearing is scheduled for March 23, 2011 and an
order is anticipated in the second quarter of 2011.

On May 3, 2010, Columbia of Virginia filed a base rate case with the VSCC seeking an annual revenue
increase of $13.0 million to recover an updated level of costs upon the expiration of its
Performance Based Regulation Plan on December 31, 2010. Columbia of Virginia also sought a Weather
Normalization Adjustment (“WNA”), cost recovery of certain gas-related items through its Purchased
Gas Adjustment (“PGA”) mechanism rather than base rates, and forward looking adjustments predicted
to occur during the rate year ending December 31, 2011. On November 16, 2010, Columbia of
Virginia, the VSCC Staff and the other parties filed a Proposed Stipulation and Recommendation
(“Stipulation”) that would result in an annual revenue increase of $4.9 million, including
authorization of the WNA and recovery of certain gas-related items through the PGA mechanism. The
Chief Hearing Examiner issued a Report on December 2, 2010 recommending approval of the
Stipulation. The VSCC issued a Final Order on December 17, 2010 adopting the Stipulation. New
rates became effective January 1, 2011.

On February 26, 2010, Columbia of Ohio filed an application to adjust rates associated with IRP and
DSM Riders. The DSM Rider tracks and recovers costs associated with Columbia of Ohio’s energy
efficiency and conservation programs. On April 14, 2010, Columbia of Ohio filed a Joint
Stipulation and Recommendation that settled all issues. On April 28, 2010, the PUCO issued an
Order approving the Stipulation. Rates associated with IRP and DSM Riders were increased by
approximately $17.8 million annually, beginning April 29, 2010.

On January 28, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC,
seeking a revenue increase of approximately $32.0 million annually. On June 25, 2010, Columbia of
Pennsylvania and the other active parties filed a Joint Petition for Settlement that would result
in an annual revenue increase of $12.0 million. On August 18, 2010, the Pennsylvania PUC entered a
final order approving the Joint Petition for Settlement and new rates went into effect on October
1, 2010.

On January 28, 2010, Columbia of Maryland filed a base rate case with the Maryland PSC, seeking a
revenue increase of $2.2 million annually in order for Columbia of Maryland to earn the rate of
return authorized by the PSC in its 2008 rate case. On May 10, 2010, the parties filed a Joint
Motion for Approval of Stipulation and Settlement Agreement that would result in an annual revenue
increase of approximately $1.7 million. The Maryland PSC issued a final order approving the
Settlement, and new rates went into effect on May 28, 2010.

On December 9, 2009, Northern Indiana filed a Petition with the IURC to extend its alternative
regulatory programs which were scheduled to expire on May 1, 2010. On February 12, 2010, Northern
Indiana, the OUCC and gas marketers supplying gas to residential and small commercial customers
filed a Joint Stipulation and Agreement proposing an extension of the programs through March 31,
2012, which was approved by the IURC on March 31, 2010.

On October 21, 2009, the IURC issued an Order in the proceeding concerning Northern Indiana’s
annual gas recovery, rejecting the use of a four-year average to compute unaccounted for gas. This
Order required Northern Indiana to refund an estimated $5.8 million to customers based on a
calculation utilizing a one-year average of unaccounted for gas for the twelve month periods ended
July 31, 2008 and July 31, 2009. A reserve provided for the full amount of the refund, which
Northern Indiana began returning to customers in March, 2010.

On June 8, 2009, Columbia of Virginia filed an application with the VSCC for approval of a CARE
Plan for a three-year period beginning January 1, 2010. The CARE Plan included incentives for
residential and small general service customers to actively pursue conservation and energy
efficiency measures, a surcharge designed to recover the costs of such measures on a real-time
basis, and a performance-based incentive for the delivery of conservation and energy efficiency
benefits. The CARE Plan also included a rate decoupling mechanism designed to mitigate the impact
of declining customer usage. On October 28, 2009, Columbia of Virginia and other parties to the
proceeding presented a unanimous settlement to the Hearing Examiner, which provided for approval of
the CARE Plan application with modifications. The settlement was approved by the VSCC on December
4, 2009, with mechanisms becoming effective January 1, 2010.

On May 1, 2009, Columbia of Kentucky filed a base rate case with the Kentucky PSC, requesting an
annual increase of $11.6 million. In its initial filing, Columbia of Kentucky sought enhancements
to rate design, as well as an expedited mechanism for the recovery of costs associated with the
replacement of the company’s infrastructure. A settlement agreement with all parties was presented
in a hearing before the Kentucky PSC on September 18, 2009. The settlement agreement provided for
a base rate increase of approximately $6 million, the authorization of an increase to the monthly
customer charge, the implementation of an Accelerated Main Replacement Program rider and the
introduction of a residential energy efficiency program. On October 26, 2009, the Kentucky PSC
approved a mechanism for recovering the costs of Columbia of Kentucky’s AMRP. In the same Order,
the Kentucky PSC also approved a mechanism for the recovery of Columbia of Kentucky’s uncollectible
expenses associated with the cost of gas. New rates went into effect on October 27, 2009.

On March 31, 2010, Columbia of Kentucky made its annual filing related to the AMRP Rider and
requested an adjustment of those rates related to the Rider. On July 12, 2010, Kentucky PSC

On April 30, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO to defer pension and other
postretirement benefits expenses above those currently subject to collection in rates, effective
January 1, 2009. On July 8, 2009, the PUCO issued an Order approving Columbia of Ohio’s
application, although the deferred balances will not accrue carrying charges and Columbia of Ohio
may not seek recovery of pension and other postretirement benefits deferrals in a base rate
proceeding for a period of five years from the date of the order. Approximately $7.9 million and
$13.0 million was deferred for 2010 and 2009, respectively.

On April 16, 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts filed a base rate case with the Massachusetts DPU,
requesting an annual increase of $34.2 million. In its initial filing, Columbia of Massachusetts
sought revenue decoupling, as well as a mechanism for the recovery of costs associated with the
replacement of the company’s infrastructure. On October 30, 2009, the Massachusetts DPU issued a
decision granting the company a $19.1 million base rate increase and approving a mechanism for the
recovery of costs associated with the replacement of portions of Columbia of Massachusetts’
infrastructure. New rates went into effect November 1, 2009. Columbia of Massachusetts filed an
application to implement its Targeted Infrastructure Replacement Factor Rider on April 30, 2010.
On October 29, 2010, the DPU approved Columbia of Massachusetts’ proposed adjustment factor, to
take effect November 1, 2010, subject to further investigation and reconciliation.

In March 2009, Indiana Governor Daniels signed Senate Bill 423 into law giving the Indiana Finance
Authority the ability to contract, on behalf of gas customers in the state of Indiana, with
developers capable of building facilities that manufacture Substitute Natural Gas from coal. The
Indiana Finance Authority (“IFA”) received one bid, from Indiana Gasification, by the April 9, 2009
deadline to initiate a Substitute Natural Gas plant in Southern Indiana under a 30 year contract.
In March 2010, Governor Daniels signed into law House Enrolled Act 1086, which allows the IFA to
enter into contracts for the sale of Substitute Natural Gas with third parties, with proceeds from
and costs of those sales being reflected on customers’ bills. The IURC must approve the final
purchase contract between the IFA and Indiana Gasification as well as the management agreement
between IFA and the utilities for collection of funds or pass through of credits to customers
related to the purchase contracts. On December 16, 2010, the IFA filed a Petition seeking approval
of the purchase contract and the management agreement. The IURC held a Prehearing Conference on
January 27, 2011, in which a procedural schedule was established. Hearings in this proceeding will
occur in early May, 2011 and based upon the schedule it is anticipated that an order will be issued
later in 2011.

On February 27, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application to adjust rates associated with Rider
IRP. Rider IRP recovers costs associated with the replacement of natural gas risers that are prone
to failure; maintenance, repair and replacement of customers service lines; an Accelerated Mains
Replacement Program; and installation of Automatic Meter Reading Devices. On June 2, 2009, Columbia
of Ohio filed a Joint Stipulation and Recommendation that settled all issues. On June 24, 2009, the
PUCO issued an Order approving the Stipulation. Rates associated with Rider IRP were increased by
$13.8 million annually beginning in July 2009.

On January 30, 2009, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO to implement a gas supply
auction. The auction replaced Columbia of Ohio’s current GCR mechanism for providing commodity gas
supplies to its sales customers. By order dated December 2, 2009, the PUCO approved a stipulation
that resolved all issues in the case. Pursuant to the stipulation, Columbia of Ohio will conduct
two consecutive one-year long standard service offer auction periods starting April 1, 2010 and
April 1, 2011. On February 23, 2010, Columbia of Ohio held the first standard service offer
auction which resulted in a final retail price adjustment of $1.93 per Mcf. On February 24, 2010
the PUCO issued an entry that approved the results of the auction and directed Columbia of Ohio to
proceed with the implementation of the standard service offer process. On February 8, 2011,
Columbia of Ohio held its second standard service offer auction which resulted in a retail price
adjustment of $1.88 per Mcf. On February 9, 2011, the PUCO issued an entry that approved the
results of the auction with the new retail price adjustment to become effective April 1, 2011.

On October 1, 2008, Columbia of Maryland filed a base rate case with the Maryland PSC. On February
20, 2009, Columbia of Maryland and all interested parties filed a unanimous settlement in the case,
recommending an annual revenue increase of $1.2 million. On March 27, 2009, the settlement was
approved as filed.

Cost Recovery and Trackers

. A significant portion of the distribution companies’ revenue is
related to the recovery of gas costs, the review and recovery of which occurs via standard
regulatory proceedings. All states require periodic review of actual gas procurement activity to
determine prudence and to permit the recovery of prudently incurred costs related to the supply of
gas for customers. NiSource distribution companies have historically been found prudent in the
procurement of gas supplies to serve customers.

Certain operating costs of the NiSource distribution companies are significant, recurring in
nature, and generally outside the control of the distribution companies. Some states allow the
recovery of such costs via cost tracking mechanisms. Such tracking mechanisms allow for
abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the distribution companies to implement charges and
recover appropriate costs. Tracking mechanisms allow for more timely recovery of such costs as
compared with more traditional cost recovery mechanisms. Examples of such mechanisms include GCR
adjustment mechanisms, tax riders, and bad debt recovery mechanisms.

Comparability of Gas Distribution Operations line item operating results is impacted by regulatory
trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses.
Increases in the expenses that are the subject of trackers, result in a corresponding increase in
net revenues and therefore have essentially no impact on total operating income results.

Certain of the NiSource distribution companies have completed rate proceedings involving
infrastructure replacement or are embarking upon regulatory initiatives to replace significant
portions of their operating systems that are nearing the end of their useful lives. Each LDC’s
approach to cost recovery may be unique, given the different laws, regulations and precedent that
exist in each jurisdiction.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations Regulatory Matters

Majorsville, PA Project.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three
separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate
Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and
compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations to gather and deliver more than
325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants
developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C.

In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain
transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed
affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non-FERC
jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three
projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering
and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West
Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009,
which were superseded by the execution of long-term service agreements in August and September
2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver
residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge
compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to
eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011.

Columbia Gulf Rate Case.

On October 28, 2010, Columbia Gulf filed a rate case with the FERC,
proposing a rate increase and tariff changes. Among other things, the filing proposes a revenue
increase of approximately $50 million to cover increases in the cost of services, which includes
adjustments for operation and maintenance expenses, capital investments, adjustments to
depreciation rates and expense, rate of return, and increased federal, state and local taxes.

In response to changing natural gas markets, Columbia Gulf also proposes, on a prospective basis, a
new rate design to establish a single maximum recourse transportation rate for transportation
anywhere on its system under a single contract and a single nomination system. In addition to the
rate adjustment and revised rate design, a number of tariff changes are proposed within the filing.
These revisions will update the Columbia Gulf tariff to be consistent with industry practices and
allow greater flexibility of service. On November 30, 2010, the FERC issued an order allowing new
rates to become effective by May 2011, subject to refund.

Electric Operations Regulatory Matters

Significant Rate Developments

. On June 27, 2008, Northern Indiana filed a petition for new
electric base rates and charges. The filing requested an increase in base rates calculated to
produce additional gross margin of $85.7 million when compared to a normalized test year ended
December 31, 2007. On August 25, 2010, the IURC issued an order authorizing electric rates to
reflect investments in reliability, environmental technology and other infrastructure improvements.

Upon review of the order, NiSource has concluded that the overall impact is in line with the
company’s expected outcome for the case and its financial outlook. The IURC approved a rate base
of $2,639.0 million and an overall rate of return of 7.29%, which results in an allowed net
operating income of $192.4 million. In conjunction with approved expenses, the rate order approves
rates designed to produce a margin of $899.0 million based on 2007 test year volumes. The approved
rate base includes the Sugar Creek Generating Station. Among other findings, the IURC also
approved revised depreciation accrual rates for electric and common plant, amortization of
deferrals, and two new tracking mechanisms, a Resource Adequacy Tracker and Regional Transmission
Organization Tracker (RTO). The IURC also found that Northern Indiana, before declaring or paying
any dividends to NiSource must provide the IURC notice at least 20 business days prior.

Consistent with Northern Indiana’s proposal, the IURC also approved a rate base that excludes Dean
H. Mitchell Generating Station and Michigan City Generating Station Units 2 and 3. In accordance
with ASC 980 (FAS 90,

Regulated Enterprises—Accounting for Abandonments and Disallowance of Plant
Costs

), Northern Indiana retired the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station and Michigan City
Generating Station Units 2 and 3 during the third quarter of 2010 as the plant is no longer used
and useful. As a result of the order, construction work in progress, materials and supplies and
base coal of $0.6 million, $2.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively were expensed during the
third quarter as there were no remaining future economic benefits associated with these assets.

As part of the order, the IURC required Northern Indiana to file a compliance filing that includes
updated tariffs for approval within 30 days, and Northern Indiana made such filing on September 14,
2010. New rates cannot be implemented until the IURC approves the filed tariff, and the IURC
outlined a process that allows the parties an opportunity to contest the compliance filing, and
various parties have filed such contests. The IURC held a procedural attorney’s conference
regarding the compliance filing on October 8, 2010. Several parties have also filed an appeal of
the IURC order to the Indiana Court of Appeals. After receipt of the prehearing conference order
in Northern Indiana’s November 19, 2010 rate case filing (discussed below), Northern Indiana, along
with the OUCC, the City of Hammond, and LaPorte County, filed a motion to vacate the compliance
filing procedural schedule and hold it in abeyance to permit parties to focus on the 2010 electric
rate case filing. If granted, rates and tariffs filed in compliance with the order would not go
into effect. The motion is pending.

Northern Indiana filed a petition for reconsideration with the IURC on September 14, 2010 to
clarify that the effective date of certain aspects of the case including the new depreciation
rates, commencement of amortization of deferred balances and discontinuance of further regulatory
deferrals and the $55.0 million bill credit should coincide with the IURC’s approval of new
customer rates. On October 22, 2010, the IURC issued a docket entry clarifying that this
interpretation is correct.

On November 19, 2010, Northern Indiana filed a petition for new electric base rates and charges.
The filing requests an increase in base rates calculated to produce additional gross revenue of
$75.7 million when compared to a normalized test year ended June 30, 2010. This is calculated to
provide the opportunity to earn a return of 7.70% on net original cost rate base of $2,706 million.
If approved, the rates from this new petition would replace
any

other existing rates, including those that may be approved by effect of the August 25, 2010 rate
order. The proposed rates would ease bill impacts on residential customers, while still allowing
Northern Indiana to continue investing in service, reliability and infrastructure improvements.
Northern Indiana filed the proceeding under the IURC’s minimum standard filing requirements
prescribing timeframes for issuance of an order if required information is supplied as part of the
rate case filing. The IURC held its prehearing conference on December 17, 2010 and issued a
prehearing conference order on January 5, 2011. The parties agreed to and the IURC ordered a
procedural schedule that includes a bifurcated hearing. The evidentiary hearing on Northern
Indiana’s case-in-chief is scheduled for the week of February 28, 2011, and the evidentiary hearing
for the remainder of the case is scheduled for the weeks of July 11, 2011 and July 25, 2011. The
case is scheduled to be fully briefed by September 30, 2011 and an Order is anticipated by the end
of 2011 with the implementation of new rates anticipated in the first quarter of 2012.

Northern Indiana received a favorable regulatory order on February 18, 2009 related to its actions
to increase its electric generating capacity and advance its electric rate case. Acting on a
settlement reached among Northern Indiana and its regulatory stakeholders, the IURC ruled that
Northern Indiana’s Sugar Creek electric generating plant was in service for ratemaking purposes as
of December 1, 2008. The IURC also approved the deferral of depreciation expenses and carrying
costs associated with the $330 million Sugar Creek investment. Northern Indiana purchased Sugar
Creek on May 30, 2008 and effective December 1, 2008, Sugar Creek was accepted as an internal
designated network resource within the MISO. The Sugar Creek investment was included in the rate
base as part of the IURC’s August 25, 2010 rate order. Northern Indiana will continue to defer
depreciation expenses and carrying costs associated with the $330.0 million Sugar Creek investment
until the IURC approves new customer rates. The annual deferral for Sugar Creek is reduced by the
annual depreciation on the Mitchell plant of $4.5 million, pursuant to the FAC-71 settlement. The
IURC also approved a five year amortization of balances that were deferred as of December 31, 2009
and such amortization will commence with the IURC’s approval of new customer rates.

During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate
review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an Order adopting most aspects of the settlement.
The Order approving the settlement provides that certain electric customers of Northern Indiana
will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year. The credits will continue at
approximately the same annual level and per the same methodology, until the IURC approves new
customer rates. Credits amounting to $60.5 million, $56.1 million and $53.9 million were
recognized for electric customers for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

On December 9, 2009, the IURC issued an order in its generic DSM investigation proceeding
establishing an overall annual energy savings goal of 2% to be achieved by Indiana jurisdictional
electric utilities in 10 years, with interim savings goals established in years one through nine.
Under the order, Northern Indiana and other jurisdictional electric utilities must file DSM plans
on July 1, 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019, with annual updates in the interim periods. The IURC
requires that certain core programs be established and administered by an independent third party.
The IURC did not make any specific findings with respect to cost recovery issues. In compliance
with the December 9, 2009 Order, on March 16, 2010 Northern Indiana filed a proposal for a
mechanism to recover the costs associated with these energy efficiency programs, including lost
revenue. On June 17, 2010, Northern Indiana filed for approval of its energy efficiency programs,
recovery of program costs and lost revenue, and its proposed performance incentive level and
methodology.

MISO

.   As part of Northern Indiana’s participation in the MISO transmission service, wholesale
energy and ancillary service markets, certain administrative fees and non-fuel costs have been
incurred. IURC orders have been issued authorizing the deferral for consideration in a future rate
case proceeding of certain non-fuel related costs incurred after Northern Indiana’s rate
moratorium, which expired on July 31, 2006. Northern Indiana proposed recovery of the cumulative
amount of net non-fuel charges that were deferred as of December 31, 2008, and to recover, through
a tracker, charges deferred between December 31, 2008 and the IURC’s approval of new customer rates
in this case. During 2010, MISO costs of $10.2 million were deferred, while $3.5 million were
deferred in 2009. As of December 31, 2010, Northern Indiana had deferred a total of $36.6 million
of MISO costs. In the rate order issued on August 25, 2010, the IURC approved an RTO tracker for
recovery of MISO non-fuel costs and revenues and off-system sales sharing and ordered that
purchased power costs and fuel-related MISO charge types

be recovered in the FAC. The IURC also approved a purchase capacity tracker referred to as the
Resource Adequacy Tracker. Neither tracker will be implemented until the IURC approves new
customer rates.

On November 7, 2008, the FERC issued an Order clarifying the RSG First Pass calculation and
requiring the MISO to resettle the RSG market using the correct calculation and to pay refunds, or
assess surcharges, to market participants, as appropriate, to correct a misinterpretation of an
order issued by FERC in April 2006. Northern Indiana believes that the original order would have
entitled Northern Indiana to a refund, with the amount subject to calculation by MISO. On June 12,
2009, however, the FERC issued an order on rehearing in which it affirmed its prior order
clarifying the method to calculate the RSG First Pass rate, but reversed its ruling requiring the
MISO to pay refunds, and collect surcharges, on equitable grounds. Northern Indiana has asked the
FERC to reconsider its decision to deny refunds and that request remains pending. MISO’s
implementation of the FERC’s April 2006 Order on the RSG First Pass calculation resulted in several
million dollars of surcharges to Northern Indiana through market resettlements implemented during
the summer of 2007. As a result, Northern Indiana and Ameren jointly filed a complaint with the
FERC on August 10, 2007, contending that the RSG rates in effect were unjust and unreasonable. On
November 10, 2008, the FERC issued an Order granting these complaints and ordering the MISO to
calculate refunds and surcharges, as appropriate, back to the date of the complaint filed by
Northern Indiana and Ameren, as authorized by Section 206 of the Federal Power Act. On May 6,
2009, however, the FERC issued an Order that upheld its decision granting the complaint, but
largely reversed its directive requiring MISO to pay refunds, and collect surcharges, on equitable
grounds. The FERC affirmed the refund and surcharge requirement only for those transactions that
occurred after the date of the November 10, 2008 Order, instead of August 10, 2007, as it had
previously required. Northern Indiana and Ameren requested rehearing of the FERC’s May 6, 2009
Order, and the FERC issued three orders regarding the issue on August 30, 2010. Northern Indiana
has requested reconsideration of two of the orders.

MISO and PJM Interconnection undertook a joint effort in April and May 2009 to identify a source of
unaccounted flows on several coordinated flowgates. The analysis found that certain PJM
Interconnection generating units that were once associated with unit-specific capacity sales were
erroneously excluded from PJM Interconnection’s market flows, which significantly affected the
congestion price on reciprocally coordinated flowgates on Northern Indiana systems. Higher PJM
Interconnection market flows on congested flowgates would have resulted in higher payments to MISO
by PJM Interconnection during market to market coordination since April 1, 2005. The model was
fixed on June 18, 2009. On January 4, 2011, the Midwest ISO and PJM Interconnection jointly filed a
settlement agreement, which is pending FERC approval, to resolve the disputed market-to market
transactions that occurred prior to June, 2009. The settlement agreement provides for a review of
existing procedures for implementing the joint operating agreement, a process for reviewing future
changes to implementation procedures, and enhanced access to each party’s data. In addition, there
was a release and discharge of all claims by any market participant related to the joint operating
agreement for all events that occurred prior to the filing of the January 4, 2011 settlement
agreement.

Cost Recovery and Trackers

.   A significant portion of Northern Indiana’s revenue is related to the
recovery of fuel costs to generate power and the fuel costs related to purchased power. These
costs are recovered through a FAC, a standard, quarterly, “summary” regulatory proceeding in
Indiana. Various intervenors, including the OUCC, had taken issue with the allocation of costs
included in Northern Indiana’s FAC-80, FAC-81 and FAC-82, which cover the reconciliation of April
– December 2008. The IURC granted a sub-docket to consider such issues in those filings. The
intervening parties and Northern Indiana discussed procedures to eliminate these concerns and to
resolve them for the historical periods. On November 4, 2009 the IURC approved a settlement
agreement which calls for a credit of $8.2 million to be provided to FAC customers beginning in
November 2009, less any amount for attorney’s fees and expenses.

As part of a settlement agreement which resolved issues surrounding purchased power costs, Northern
Indiana implemented a new “benchmarking standard,” that became effective in October 2007, which
defines the price above which purchased power costs must be absorbed by Northern Indiana and are
not permitted to be passed on to ratepayers. The benchmark is based upon the costs of power
generated by a hypothetical natural gas fired unit using gas purchased and delivered to Northern
Indiana and a set sharing mechanism. The agreement also contemplated Northern Indiana adding
generating capacity to its existing portfolio by providing for the
benchmark to be adjusted

as new capacity is added. The dispatch of Sugar Creek into MISO on December 1, 2008 triggered a
change in the benchmark, whereby the first 500 mw tier of the benchmark provision was eliminated.
During 2010 and 2009, the amount of purchased power costs exceeding the benchmark amounted to $0.4
million and $1.0 million, respectively, which was recognized as a net reduction of revenues. In
the rate order issued on August 25, 2010, the IURC approved the continued use of a purchased power
benchmark that is consistent with the IPL and Vectren South methodologies and includes a
modification that may reduce the purchased power volumes subject to the benchmark.

Northern Indiana has approval from the IURC to recover certain environmental related costs through
an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the
capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEM’s NOx SIP and CAIR and CAMR
compliance plan projects through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation
expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. The IURC approved
the continued use of the ECRM and the EERM trackers in the August 25, 2010 rate order and Northern
Indiana has requested similar treatment in the November 19, 2010 filing. When the IURC approves new
customer rates, the cost relating to environmental projects that were in service as of the filed
test year will be recovered through base rates and will no longer be tracked through the ECRM and
EERM.

The IURC has authorized Northern Indiana to recover costs relating to qualified pollution control
projects estimated to cost $514 million, which includes new projects at the R.M. Schahfer
Generating Station approved by the IURC’s December 29, 2010 Order. On February 4, 2011 Northern
Indiana filed ECR-17 and EER-8, which included $281 million (capital expenditure net of accumulated
depreciation) of such capital costs and operating and maintenance expenses of $27 million for the
year ended December 31, 2010. In the first quarter of 2011, Northern Indiana anticipates it will
file a petition with the IURC for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the
construction of additional environmental projects required to comply with the NOV consent decree
lodged in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana on January 13,
2011.

Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities

NiSource is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The primary
risks managed by using derivative instruments are commodity price risk and interest rate risk.
Derivative natural gas contracts are entered into to manage the price risk associated with natural
gas price volatility and to secure forward natural gas prices. Interest rate swaps are entered
into to manage interest rate risk associated with NiSource’s fixed-rate borrowings. NiSource
designates many of its commodity forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases of
commodities and designates its interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate borrowings.
Additionally, certain NiSource subsidiaries enter into forward physical contracts with various
third parties to procure or sell natural gas or power. These forward physical contracts are
derivatives which may qualify for the normal purchase and normal sales exception which would not
require mark-to-market accounting.

Accounting Policy for Derivative Instruments.

The ASC topic on accounting for derivatives and
hedging requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, unless such contracts are exempted such as a normal
purchase and normal sale contract under the provisions of the ASC topic. The accounting for
changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and
resulting designation.

NiSource uses a variety of derivative instruments (exchange traded futures and options, physical
forwards and options, basis contracts, financial commodity swaps, and interest rate swaps) to
effectively manage its commodity price risk and interest rate risk exposure. If certain conditions
are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in
the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a
hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. In order for a
derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument
and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed
at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the
hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recognized currently in
earnings. For derivative contracts that qualify for the normal
purchase and


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

normal sales exception, a contract’s fair value is not recognized in the Consolidated Financial
Statements until the contract is settled.

Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss), regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the
designation of the derivative instrument. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow
hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the
hedged risks. If a forecasted transaction corresponding to a cash flow hedge is no longer probable
to occur, the accumulated gains or losses on the derivative are recognized currently in earnings.
For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period together with the
change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate-making process, the
rate-regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets
and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical
commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or
passed back to customers in revenues through rates. When gains and losses are recognized in
earnings, they are recognized in cost of sales for derivatives that correspond to commodity risk
activities and are recognized in interest expense for derivatives that correspond to interest-rate
risk activities.

NiSource has elected not to net fair value amounts for its derivative instruments or the fair value
amounts recognized for its right to receive cash collateral or obligation to pay cash collateral
arising from those derivative instruments recognized at fair value, which are executed with the
same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. NiSource discloses amounts recognized for the
right to reclaim cash collateral within “Restricted cash” and amounts recognized for the right to
return cash collateral within current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Commodity Price Risk Programs

. NiSource and NiSource’s utility customers are exposed to
variability in cash flows associated with natural gas purchases and volatility in natural gas
prices. NiSource purchases natural gas for sale and delivery to its retail, commercial and
industrial customers, and for most customers the variability in the market price of gas is passed
through in their rates. Some of NiSource’s utility subsidiaries offer programs where variability
in the market price of gas is assumed by the respective utility. The objective of NiSource’s
commodity price risk programs is to mitigate this gas cost variability, for NiSource or on behalf
of its customers, associated with natural gas purchases or sales by economically hedging the
various gas cost components by using a combination of futures, options, forward physical contracts,
basis swap contracts or other derivative contracts. Northern Indiana also uses derivative
contracts to minimize risk associated with power price volatility. These commodity price risk
programs and their respective accounting treatment are described below.

Northern Indiana, Northern Indiana Fuel and Light, Kokomo Gas, Columbia of Pennsylvania, Columbia
of Kentucky, Columbia of Maryland and Columbia of Virginia use NYMEX derivative contracts to
minimize risk associated with gas price volatility. These derivative programs must be marked to
fair value, but because these derivatives are used within the framework of the companies’ GCR
mechanism, regulatory assets or liabilities are recorded to offset the change in the fair value of
these derivatives.

Northern Indiana, Columbia of Pennsylvania and Columbia of Virginia offer a fixed price program as
an alternative to the standard GCR mechanism. These services provide customers with the
opportunity to either lock in their gas cost or place a cap on the gas costs that would be charged
in future months. In order to hedge the anticipated physical purchases associated with these
obligations, forward physical contracts, NYMEX futures and NYMEX options are used to secure forward
gas prices. The accounting treatment elected for these contracts is varied whereby certain of
these contracts have been accounted for as cash flow hedges while some contracts are not. The
normal purchase and normal sales exception is elected for forward physical contracts associated
with these programs where delivery of the commodity is probable to occur.

Northern Indiana also offers a DependaBill program to its customers as an alternative to the
standard tariff rate that is charged to residential customers. The program allows Northern Indiana
customers to fix their total monthly bill in future months at a flat rate regardless of gas usage
or commodity cost. In order to hedge the anticipated physical purchases associated with these
obligations, forward physical contracts, NYMEX futures and NYMEX
options have


ITEM 8.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

been used to secure forward gas prices. The accounting treatment elected for these contracts is
varied whereby certain of these contracts have been accounted for as cash flow hedges while some
contracts are not. The normal purchase and normal sales exception is elected for forward physical
contracts associated with these programs where delivery of the commodity is probable to occur.

Northern Indiana enters into gas purchase contracts at first of the month prices that give
counterparties the daily option to either sell an additional package of gas at first of the month
prices or recall the original volume to be delivered. Northern Indiana charges a fee for this
option. The changes in the fair value of these options are primarily due to the changing
expectations of the future intra-month volatility of gas prices. These written options are
derivative instruments, must be marked to fair value and do not meet the requirement for hedge
accounting treatment. However, Northern Indiana records the related gains and losses associated
with these transactions as a regulatory asset or liability.

Columbia of Kentucky, Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia of Maryland enter
into contracts that allow counterparties the option to sell gas to them at first of the month
prices for a particular month of delivery. These Columbia LDCs charge the counterparties a fee for
this option. The changes in the fair value of the options are primarily due to the changing
expectations of the future intra-month volatility of gas prices. These Columbia LDCs defer a
portion of the change in the fair value of the options as either a regulatory asset or liability
based on the regulatory customer sharing mechanisms in place, with the remaining changes in fair
value recognized currently in earnings.

As part of the MISO Day 2 initiative, Northern Indiana was allocated or has purchased FTRs. These
FTRs help Northern Indiana offset congestion costs due to the MISO Day 2 activity. The FTRs are
marked to fair value and are not accounted for as a hedge, but since congestion costs are
recoverable through the fuel cost recovery mechanism, the related gains and losses associated with
marking these derivatives to market are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability. In the second
quarter of 2008, MISO changed its allocation procedures from an allocation of FTRs to an allocation
of ARRs, whereby Northern Indiana was allocated ARRs based on its historical use of the MISO
administered transmission system. ARRs entitle the holder to a stream of revenues or charges based
on the price of the associated FTR in the FTR auction. ARRs are not derivatives and are convertible
to FTRs. Northern Indiana purchased FTRs in the second quarter of 2009 and 2010 for a 12 month
period starting June 1 for each respective year.

NiSource is in the process of winding down its unregulated natural gas marketing business, where
gas derivatives are utilized to hedge expected future gas purchases and sales. Prior to the
decision to wind down this business in the second quarter of 2009, the financial derivatives
associated with commercial and industrial gas sales were accounted for as cash flow hedges.
NiSource also has corresponding forward physical sales contracts of natural gas with customers.
These forward physical sales contracts are derivatives that have generally qualified for the normal
purchase and normal sales exception, which NiSource had elected prior to the decision to wind down
the business in 2009. As a result of the decision to wind down the business, certain forecasted
transactions were no longer probable to occur, which triggered the mark-to-market treatment of
certain forward sales contracts that were previously exempt under the normal purchase and normal
sale exception. In addition, the mark-to-market gains and losses deferred in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) related to certain financial derivatives accounted for as a cash flow
hedge were recognized in income. NiSource established a reserve of $6.4 million and $9.2 million
against certain derivatives as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. This
amount represents reserves related to the creditworthiness of certain customers, fair value of
future cash flows, and the cost of maintaining significant amounts of restricted cash. Refer to
Note 4, “Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The physical sales contracts
marked-to-market had a fair value of approximately $154.4 million at December 31, 2010 and $126.9
million at December 31, 2009, while the financial derivative contracts marked-to-market had a fair
value loss of $137.5 million at December 31, 2010, and $114.6 million at December 31, 2009.

Interest Rate Risk Activities

. NiSource recognizes that the prudent and selective use of
derivatives may help it to lower its cost of debt capital and manage its interest rate exposure.
NiSource Finance has entered into various “receive fixed” and “pay floating” interest rate swap
agreements which modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long-term debt from
fixed to variable rate. These interest rate swaps also serve to hedge the fair market value of
NiSource Finance’s outstanding debt portfolio. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had $7.4 billion
of outstanding debt, of which $500.0 million is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a
result of the fixed-to-variable interest rate swap transactions. These interest rate swaps are
designated as fair value hedges. NiSource had no net gain or loss recognized in earnings due to
hedging ineffectiveness from prior years.

On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in a
notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2-year term. NiSource Finance
received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based
on U.S. 6-month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at
the initial date of the swaps. On September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a
fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of
$110 million. NiSource Finance elected to terminate the swap when Lehman Holdings Inc., guarantor
under the applicable International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreement, filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the
swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. The
mark-to-market close-out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was
determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. The termination
of this swap did not impact NiSource’s ability to assert hedge accounting for its remaining
fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining
$550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated.

On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in
a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11-year term. NiSource Finance
receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based
on U.S. 6-month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at
the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July
15, 2013.

Contemporaneously with the issuance on September 16, 2005 of $1 billion of its 5.25% and 5.45%
notes, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with
six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being
amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense over the term of the
underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88%, respectively. As of
December 31, 2010, accumulated other comprehensive loss
includes


ITEM 8.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

$12.9 million related to forward starting interest rate swap settlement. These derivative contracts
are accounted for as a cash flow hedge.

As of December 31, 2010, NiSource holds a 47.5% interest in Millennium. During 2008, Millennium
entered into various interest rate swap agreements in order to protect against the risk of
increasing interest rates. During August 2010, Millennium completed the refinancing of its
long-term debt, securing permanent fixed-rate financing through the private placement issuance of
two tranches of notes totaling $725.0 million, $375.0 million at 5.33% due June 30, 2027, and
$350.0 million at 6.00% due June 30, 2032. Upon the issuance of these notes, Millennium repaid all
outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement, terminated the sponsor guarantee and cash
settled the interest rate hedges. These interest rate hedges were primarily accounted for as cash
flow hedges by Millennium. As an equity method investment, NiSource is required to recognize a
proportional share of Millennium’s OCI. The remaining unrealized loss of $21.1 million, net of tax,
related to these terminated interest rate swaps is being amortized into earnings using the
effective interest method through interest expense as interest payments are made by Millennium.

* For the amounts of realized/unrealized gain (loss) recognized in income on
derivatives disclosed in the table above, losses of $36.7 million, $64.4
million, and $31.4 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were deferred
per regulatory orders. These amounts will be amortized to income over future
periods up to twelve months per regulatory order.

During the second quarter of 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax)
related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Cost of Sales
due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the
unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No additional
reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Cost of Sales due to the
probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur were recorded during 2010 or 2008.

NiSource’s derivative instruments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 do not
contain any credit-risk-related contingent features.

Certain NiSource affiliates have physical commodity purchase agreements that contain “ratings
triggers” that require increases in collateral if the credit rating of NiSource or certain of its
affiliates are rated below BBB- by Standard & Poor’s or below Baa3 by Moody’s. These agreements
are primarily for the physical purchase or sale of natural gas and electricity. As of December 31,
2010, the collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to
approximately $0.1 million. In addition to agreements with
ratings triggers, there are some


ITEM 8.

agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could
result in additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact
business.

NiSource had $198.3 million and $173.2 million of cash on deposit with brokers for margin
requirements associated with open derivative positions reflected within “Restricted cash” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.

Variable Interest Entities and Equity Investments

A.

Variable Interest Entities

.

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to amend the manner in which entities evaluate
whether consolidation is required for VIEs. NiSource adopted the guidance on January 1, 2010. See
Note 2, “Recent Accounting Pronouncements,” regarding the consolidation of variable interest
entities.

In general, a VIE is an entity which (1) has an insufficient amount of at-risk equity to permit the
entity to finance its activities without additional financial subordinated support provided by any
parties, (2) whose at-risk equity owners, as a group, do not have power, through voting rights or
similar rights, to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s
economic performance or (3) whose at-risk owners do not absorb the entity’s losses or receive the
entity’s residual return. A VIE is required to be consolidated by a company if that company is
determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.

NiSource consolidates those VIEs for which it is the primary beneficiary. Prior to the adoption of
the new FASB guidance on consolidation of variable interest entities, the prevalent method for
determining the primary beneficiary was through a quantitative method. With the adoption of the
guidance, NiSource also considers qualitative elements in determining the primary beneficiary.
These qualitative measures include the ability to control an entity and the obligation to absorb
losses or the right to receive benefits.

NiSource’s analysis under this standard includes an assessment of guarantees, operating leases,
purchase agreements, and other contracts, as well as its investments and joint ventures. For items
that have been identified as variable interests, or where there is involvement with an identified
variable interest entity, an in-depth review of the relationship between the relevant entities and
NiSource is made to evaluate qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the primary
beneficiary, if any, and whether additional disclosures would be required under the current
standard.

At December 31, 2010, consistent with prior periods, NiSource consolidated its low income housing
real estate investments from which NiSource derives certain tax benefits. Based on the newly
adopted guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities, these investments met the
definition of a VIE. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource is a 99% limited partner with a net
investment of approximately $0.3 million. Consistent with prior periods, NiSource evaluated the
nature and intent of the low income housing investments when determining the primary beneficiary.
NiSource concluded that it continues to be the primary beneficiary. Subject to certain conditions
precedent, NiSource has the contractual right to take control of the low income housing properties.
At December 31, 2010, gross assets of the low income housing real estate investments in continuing
operations were $28.4 million. Current and non-current assets were $0.8 million and $27.6 million,
respectively. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource recorded long-term debt of approximately $10.9
million as a result of consolidating these investments. However, this debt is nonrecourse to
NiSource and NiSource’s direct and indirect subsidiaries. Approximately $0.4 million of the assets
are restricted to settle the obligations of the entity.

Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products
and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under
this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a
combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various
performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana
terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty-year contract period. Northern Indiana has
made an


ITEM 8.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

exhaustive effort to obtain information needed from Pure Air to determine the status of Pure Air as
a VIE. However, Northern Indiana had not been able to obtain this information and as a result, it
is unclear whether Pure Air is a VIE and if Northern Indiana is the primary beneficiary. Northern
Indiana will continue to request the information required to determine whether Pure Air is a VIE.

million, and $39.2 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the
result of cash required for Millennium’s refinancing. Millennium returned $23.8 million of capital
to Columbia Transmission during 2010. No distributions were made during the same period last year.
Hardy Storage distributed $12.9 million of earnings to each of its partners during 2010.

The effective income tax rates were 32.4%, 41.8% and 33.4% in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. The 9.4% decrease in the overall effective tax rate in 2010 versus 2009 was
primarily the result of 2010 rate settlements allowing the flow through of certain tax benefits in
rates. In 2009, the company recorded in its tax provision the impact of certain nondeductible
expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million, additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7
million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes, and a reduction in
AFUDC-Equity that increased tax expense by $3.2 million. In 2008, the effective tax rate was
reduced by $14.9 million for the change in Massachusetts state taxes discussed below.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the Internal Revenue Service to
change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal
Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The company recorded a net long-term
receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact
on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change.

The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax
deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the
Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax
asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At
the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSource’s obligation
to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 – Income Taxes requires the impact
of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income
statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource
reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug
Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the
reversal of the related regulatory liability.

During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax
method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and
state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. As a result of the new tax accounting
method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. Refunds of
$263.5 million were received in October 2009, with additional refunds of $25.3 million received in
December 2009 and January and February 2010. The balance of the refunds was received during 2010.
The tax loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax
expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state’s
restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax
expense of $5.5 million.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Governor of Massachusetts signed into law a bill that
significantly changed the Massachusetts corporate income tax regime. Under the new law, which
became effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, NiSource calculates its
Massachusetts income tax liability on a unitary basis, meaning that the income tax obligation to
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is determined based on an apportioned share of all of NiSource’s
income, rather than just the income of NiSource’s subsidiaries doing business in Massachusetts.
Because of NiSource’s substantial operations outside of Massachusetts, the new law had the impact
of reducing the deferred income tax liability to Massachusetts. NiSource recognized the impact of
this tax law change as a $14.9 million reduction in income tax expense in 2008. Income tax expense
for 2009 reflects the impact of the new law on a prospective basis.

On December 9, 2008, Columbia Transmission converted from a corporation to a limited liability
company. Under the Internal Revenue Code and most state income tax provisions, limited liability
companies with just one owner are treated as entities that are disregarded as separate from their
owners. As such, for federal and state income tax purposes, Columbia Transmission is treated as a
division of Columbia, its parent corporation. Upon conversion, NiSource recorded additional
deferred tax benefits of $4.6 million on its Consolidated Balance Sheet and in its Statement of
Consolidated Income.

State income tax net operating loss benefits were $36.2 million and $22.7 million as of December

it will realize $35.2 million and $21.3 million of these benefits as of December 31, 2010 and
December 31, 2009, respectively, prior to their expiration. As such, a valuation allowance has
been recorded of $1.0 million and $1.4 million as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009,
respectively. The remaining net operating loss carryforward represents a Federal carryforward of
$85.4 million that will expire in 2030. The state amounts are primarily for Indiana, Pennsylvania,
West Virginia and Kentucky. The loss carryforward periods expire in various tax years from 2023
through 2030.

As discussed above, NiSource was granted permission to change its tax method of accounting for
capitalizing certain costs and has taken certain positions related to this change in its 2008
income tax return. NiSource’s determination of what constitutes a capital cost versus ordinary
expense will be reviewed upon audit by the IRS and may be subject to subsequent adjustment. As
such, the status of this tax return position is uncertain at this time. During 2009, NiSource added
$114.4 million to its liability for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions related
to this issue. In 2010, NiSource received permission to change its method of accounting for
capitalizing overhead costs. This method change will be subject to audit as well. The company
recorded an unrecognized tax benefit related to this uncertain tax position of $17.6 million in
2010.

Offsetting the liability for unrecognized tax benefits are $131.4 million of related outstanding
tax receivables and state net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a net balance of $2.2
million, related to the tax method change issues. NiSource anticipates it will settle the entire
tax position, including interest, at the completion of the IRS audit
of the 2008 and 2009 returns.

Except as discussed above, there have been no other material changes in 2010 to NiSource’s
uncertain tax positions recorded as of December 31, 2009.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 that, if
recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $3.9 million, $2.9 million and $3.5 million,
respectively. As of December 31, 2009, NiSource did not anticipate any significant changes to its
liability for unrecognized tax benefits over the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, and
NiSource does not anticipate any significant changes to its December 31, 2010 liability for
unrecognized tax benefits over the twelve months ended December 31, 2011.

NiSource recognizes accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits, accrued interest on other income
tax liabilities, and tax penalties in income tax expense. With respect to its unrecognized tax
benefits, NiSource recorded $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.2 million in interest expense in the
Statement of Consolidated Income for the periods ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. For the periods ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, NiSource reported
$0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of accrued interest payable on unrecognized tax
benefits on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. There were no accruals for penalties recorded in the
Statement of Consolidated Income for the periods ended December 31, 2010, December 31, 2009 and
December 31, 2008 and there were no balances for accrued penalties recorded on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.

NiSource is subject to income taxation in the United States and various state jurisdictions,
primarily Indiana, West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Maryland, Tennessee, New Jersey and New York.

Because NiSource is part of the IRS’s Large and Mid-Size Business program, each year’s federal
income tax return is typically audited by the IRS. As of December 31, 2010, tax years through 2004
have been audited and are closed to further assessment. The audit of tax years 2005, 2006 and 2007
began on December 2, 2009. The statute of limitations for tax years 2005, 2006 and 2007  has been extended
to June 30, 2012.

The statute of limitations in each of the state jurisdictions in which NiSource operates remain
open until the years are settled for federal income tax purposes, at which time amended state
income tax returns reflecting all federal income tax adjustments are filed. As of December 31,
2010, there were no state income tax audits in progress that would have a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements.

12.          Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

NiSource provides defined contribution plans and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans
that cover the majority of its employees. Benefits under the defined benefit retirement plans
reflect the employees’ compensation, years of service and age at retirement. Additionally,
NiSource provides health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. The
majority of employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement age while
working for NiSource. The expected cost of such benefits is accrued during the employees’ years of
service. Current rates of rate-regulated companies include postretirement benefit costs, including
amortization of the regulatory assets that arose prior to inclusion of these costs in rates. For
most plans, cash contributions are remitted to grantor trusts.

NiSource Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans’ Asset Management

. NiSource employs a
total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to
maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. Risk tolerance is
established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and asset class
volatility. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income
investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as
well as growth, value, small and large capitalizations. Other assets such as private equity and
hedge funds are used judiciously to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio
diversification. Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely
manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of
the underlying assets. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through
quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability
studies.

NiSource utilizes a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and
rebalancing in determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are
studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are analyzed to
ensure that they are consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with
higher volatility generate greater return over the long run. Current market factors such as
inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are
determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and
appropriateness.

The most important component of an investment strategy is the portfolio asset mix, or the
allocation between the various classes of securities available to the pension plan for investment
purposes. The asset mix and acceptable minimum and maximum ranges established represents a
long-term view and are as follows:

The categorization of investments into the asset classes in the table above are based on
definitions established by the NiSource Benefits Committee. Alternative investments consist
primarily of private equity and hedge fund investments. As of December 31, 2010, $555.3 million of
defined benefit pension assets and $22.1 million of other postretirement benefit assets included in
international equities, domestic equities or fixed income asset classes in the table above would be
considered alternative investments, as that term is defined by the AICPA, in addition to those
investments in the alternative investments asset class. As of December 31, 2009, $409.9 million of
defined benefit pension assets and $24.5 million of other postretirement benefit assets included in
international equities or fixed income asset classes in the table above would be considered
alternative investments. Alternative investments are defined in the AICPA practice aid on audit
considerations for alternative investments as investments not listed on national exchanges or
over-the-counter markets, or for which quoted market prices are not available from sources such as
financial publications or the exchanges.

Alternative investment values are based on estimates developed by external investment managers and
subject to a review process performed by management. In making such valuation determinations, the
investment managers consider factors that may include the cost of the investment, developments
since the acquisition of the investment, comparisons to similar publicly traded investments,
subsequent purchases of the same investment by other investors, the current financial position and
operating results of the issuer and such other factors as may be deemed relevant. A range of
possible values exist for these securities, and therefore, the estimated values may differ from the
values that would have been recorded had a ready market for these securities existed.

Fair Value Measurements.

The following table sets forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy,
the Master Trust and OPEB investment assets at fair value as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Assets
and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is
significant to the fair value measurement. Total Master
Trust


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

investment assets at fair value classified within Level 3 were $314.1 million and $287.7
million as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. Such amounts were
approximately 14% and 15% of the Master Trust’s total investments as reported on the statement of
net assets available for benefits at fair value as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009,
respectively.

Investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents
and are normally included in the fair value measurements hierarchy as
Level 1. Equity securities, mutual funds, and U.S. treasuries whose prices are obtained from quoted prices in active markets are also classified
as Level 1. In cases where equity securities are not actively traded, they are reflected as Level
2 or Level 3 depending on the specific security and how active the market is for the respective
security. The fair values of most fixed income securities are based on evaluated prices that
reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities,
adjusted for observable differences and are generally categorized as Level 2. Commingled funds are
maintained by investment companies that hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of
fund objectives, and the values of the majority of these commingled funds are not publicly quoted
and must trade through a broker. Commingled funds that hold underlying investments that have
prices which are derived from the quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 2.
Commingled funds that hold underlying investments that have prices which are not derived from the
quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 3. These investments are often valued by
investment managers on a periodic basis using pricing models that use market, income, and cost
valuation methods. In addition, NiSource’s investment in hedge funds, private equity partnerships,
and real estate assets are also valued by investment managers on a periodic basis using pricing
models that use market, income, and cost valuation methods and are classified as Level 3.

have been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NiSource’s accumulated benefit obligation for its pension plans was $2,429.5 million and
$2,295.3 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The accumulated benefit
obligation as of a date is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension
benefit formula to employee service rendered prior to that date and based on current and past
compensation levels. The accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit
obligation disclosed in the table above in that it includes no assumptions about future
compensation levels.

NiSource pension plans were underfunded by $578.4 million at December 31, 2010 compared to being
underfunded at December 31, 2009 by $674.5 million. The improvement in funded status was due
primarily to favorable returns on plan assets and employer contributions in 2010, partially offset
by a decrease in discount rate from the prior measurement date. NiSource contributed $161.8
million and $102.9 million to its pension plans in 2010 and 2009, respectively.

NiSource’s funded status for its other postretirement benefit plans improved by $15.5 million to an
underfunded status of $429.2 million due primarily to favorable asset returns and employer
contributions, partially offset by a decrease in discount rate from the prior measurement date.
NiSource contributed approximately $50.0 million and $60.8 million to its other postretirement
benefit plans in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No amounts of NiSource’s pension or other
postretirement plans’ assets are expected to be returned to NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in
2011.

A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of
lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource
Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the “Consolidated Flex Plan”), a component welfare benefit plan of
the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and
capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health
Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a
significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan
assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex
Plan and established the NiSource Post-65 Retiree Medical Plan (the “Post-65 Retiree Plan”) as a
separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the
establishment of the Post-65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post-age
65 retirees and their eligible post-age 65 dependents are

now offered under the Post-65 Retiree Plan, a retiree-only plan, and not under the Consolidated
Flex Plan. The Post-65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act
requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the
Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post-65 Retiree Plan required a second
remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010.
The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the
other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding
increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net
periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million, of
which $1.3 million was recognized during the second quarter of 2010 and $0.9 million was recognized
during the third quarter of 2010.

The following table provides the key assumptions that were used to calculate the pension and other
postretirement benefits obligations for NiSource’s various plans as of December 31.

NiSource recognized cost of $82.3 million for its pension plans in 2010 compared to cost of $127.0
million in 2009 due primarily to favorable returns on plan assets experienced in 2010. For its
other postretirement benefit plans, NiSource recognized $36.5 million in cost in 2010 compared to
$56.4 million in cost in 2009. For 2010 and 2009, pension and other postretirement benefit cost of
approximately $6.2 million and $65.4 million, respectively, was capitalized as a component of plant
or recognized as a regulatory asset or liability consistent with regulatory orders for certain of
NiSource’s regulated businesses.

Authorized Classes of Cumulative Preferred and Preference Stocks

NiSource has 20,000,000 authorized shares of Preferred Stock with a $0.01 par value, of which
4,000,000 shares are designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares.

The authorized classes of par value and no par value cumulative preferred and preference stocks of
Northern Indiana are as follows: 2,400,000 shares of Cumulative Preferred with a $100 par value;
3,000,000 shares of Cumulative Preferred with no par value; 2,000,000 shares of Cumulative
Preference with a $50 par value; and 3,000,000 shares of Cumulative Preference with no par value.

As of December 31, 2010, NiSource and Northern Indiana had no preferred shares outstanding. All of
NiSource’s retained earnings at December 31, 2010 are free of restrictions.

Common Stock

As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 400,000,000 authorized shares of common stock with a $0.01

Common Stock Dividend.

Holders of shares of NiSource’s common stock are entitled to receive
dividends when, as and if declared by the Board out of funds legally available. The policy of the
Board has been to declare cash dividends on a quarterly basis payable on or about the 20th day of
February, May, August and November. NiSource has paid quarterly common dividends totaling $0.92
per share for the 2010, 2009 and 2008 years. By
unanimous

written consent dated January 19, 2011, the Board declared a quarterly common dividend of
$0.23 per share, payable on February 18, 2011 to holders of record on January 31, 2011.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan.

NiSource offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock
Purchase Plan which allows participants to reinvest dividends and make voluntary cash payments to
purchase additional shares of common stock on the open market.

Forward Agreements.

On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as
forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of
NiSource’s common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by
the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed
shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements referred to
below.

In connection with the public offering, NiSource entered into forward sale agreements (“Forward
Agreements”) with an affiliate of the forward seller covering an aggregate of 24,265,000 shares of
NiSource’s common stock. Settlement of the Forward Agreements is expected to occur no later than
September 10, 2012. Subject to certain exceptions, NiSource may elect cash or net share settlement
for all or a portion of its obligations under the Forward Agreements. Upon any physical settlement
of the Forward Agreements, NiSource will deliver shares of its common stock in exchange for cash
proceeds at the forward sale price, which initially is $15.9638 and is subject to adjustment as
provided in the Forward Agreements. The equity forward initial forward price represents the public
offering price of $16.50 per share, net of underwriting discounts and commissions. If the equity
forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2010, the Company would have
received approximately $381.3 million based on a forward price of $15.7158 for the 24,265,000
shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares.

In accordance with ASC 815-40,

Derivatives and Hedging- Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity,

NiSource
has classified the Forward Agreements as an equity transaction. As a result of this classification,
no amounts have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the period
ended December 31, 2010 in connection with the Forward Agreements. The only impact to the
Consolidated Financial Statements is the inclusion of incremental shares within the calculation of
fully diluted EPS under the treasury stock method. Refer to Note 1-M, “Earnings Per Share,” for
additional information.

15.

Share-Based Compensation

Prior to May 11, 2010, NiSource issued long-term incentive grants to key management employees under
a long-term incentive plan approved by stockholders on April 13, 1994 (1994 Plan). The 1994 Plan,
as amended and restated, permits the following types of grants, separately or in combination:
nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock units, contingent stock units and dividend equivalents payable on grants
of options, performance units and contingent stock awards.

The Stockholders approved and adopted the NiSource Inc. 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus
Plan”), at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 11, 2010. The Omnibus Plan provides that
the number of shares of common stock of the Company available for awards is 8,000,000 plus the
number of shares subject to outstanding awards granted under either the 1994 Plan or the Director
Plan (described below) that expire or terminate for any reason and no further awards are permitted
to be granted under the 1994 Plan or the Director Plan. The types of awards authorized under the
Omnibus Plan do not significantly differ from those previously allowed under the 1994 Plan. As of
December 31, 2010, there were 8,076,721 shares reserved for future awards under the Omnibus Plan.

NiSource recognized stock-based employee compensation expense of $11.2 million, $9.6 million and
$9.5 million during the years of 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as well as related tax benefits
of $3.7 million, $4.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively.

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

As of December 31, 2010, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested
awards amounted to $12.9 million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining
requisite service period of 1.7 years.

Stock Options

. Option grants are granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high
and low market price on the day of the grant. As of December 31, 2010, the weighted average
remaining contractual life of the
options outstanding and exercisable was 2.3 years. Stock option transactions for the year ended

No options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. There was no
aggregate intrinsic value for the options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2010.

Restricted Stock Units

. In 2010, NiSource granted restricted stock units of 265,134, subject to
service conditions. The total grant date fair value of the restricted units was $3.5 million,
based on the average market price of NiSource’s common stock at the date of each grant less the
present value of dividends not received during the vesting period, which will be expensed, net of
forfeitures, over the vesting period of approximately three years. The service conditions for
212,428 units lapse on January 2013 when 100% of the shares vest. If before January 2013, the
employee terminates employment (1) due to retirement, having attained age 55 and completed ten
years of service, or (2) due to death or disability, the employment conditions will lapse with
respect to a pro rata portion of the restricted units on the date of termination. Termination due
to any other reason will result in all restricted units awarded being forfeited effective the
employee’s date of termination. Employees will be entitled to receive dividends upon vesting. The
service conditions lapse for the remaining 52,706 units between August 2012 and December 2014. As
of December 31, 2010, 262,596 nonvested restricted stock units were granted and outstanding for the
2010 award.

In 2009, NiSource granted restricted stock units of 335,068, subject to service conditions. The
total grant date fair value of the restricted units was $2.5 million, based on the average market
price of NiSource’s common stock at the date of each grant less the present value of dividends not
received during the vesting period, which will be expensed, net of forfeitures, over the vesting
period of approximately three years. The service conditions for 313,568 units lapse on January
2012. If before January 2012, the employee terminates employment (1) due to retirement, having
attained age 55 and completed ten years of service, or (2) due to death or disability, the
employment conditions will lapse with respect to a pro rata portion of the restricted units on the
date of termination. Termination due to any other reason will result in all restricted units
awarded being forfeited effective the employee’s date of termination. Employees will be entitled
to receive dividends upon vesting. The service conditions lapse for the remaining 21,500 units
between August 2012 and June 2014. As of December 31, 2010, 315,786 nonvested restricted stock
units were granted and outstanding for the 2009 award.

In 2008, NiSource granted restricted stock units of 244,907, subject to service conditions. The
total grant date fair value of the restricted units was $3.7 million, based on the average market
price of NiSource’s common stock at the date of each grant less the present value of dividends not
received during the vesting period, which will be expensed, net of forfeitures, over the vesting
period of approximately three years. The service conditions for 208,609 units lapse on January
2011. If before January 2011, the employee terminates employment (1) due to retirement, having
attained age 55 and completed ten years of service, or (2) due to death or disability, the
employment conditions will

lapse with respect to a pro rata portion of the restricted units on the

awarded being forfeited effective the employee’s date of termination. Employees will be entitled
to receive dividends upon vesting. The remaining 36,298 awards vested evenly over a three-year
period ended December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, 184,159 nonvested restricted stock units

Time-accelerated Awards

. NiSource awarded restricted shares and restricted stock units that contain
provisions for time-accelerated vesting to key executives under the 1994 Plan. Most of these
awards were issued in January 2003 and January 2004. These awards of restricted stock or
restricted stock units generally vested over a period of six years or, in the case of restricted
stock units, at age 62 if an employee would become age 62 within six years, but not less than three
years. If certain predetermined criteria involving measures of total shareholder return had been
met, as measured at the end of the third year after the grant date, the awards would have vested at
the end of the third year. The total shareholder return measures established were not met;
therefore, these grants did not have an accelerated vesting period. During the first quarter of
2010, all awards with time-accelerated vesting provisions vested due to the lapse of service
conditions.

The following table summarizes the activity related to restricted shares and restricted stock units
that contain provisions for time-accelerated vesting for the year ended December 31, 2010:

Contingent Stock Units

. In 2010, NiSource granted 662,969 contingent stock units subject to
performance conditions. The grant date fair-value of the awards was $8.6 million, based on the
average market price of NiSource’s common stock at the date of each grant less the present value of
dividends not received during the vesting period which will be expensed, net of forfeitures, over
the three year requisite service period. The performance conditions are based on achievement of
non-GAAP financial measures. The service conditions lapse on January 31, 2013 when 100% of the
shares vest. If the employee terminates employment before January 31, 2013 (1) due to retirement,
having attained age 55 and completed ten years of service, or (2) due to death or disability, the
employment conditions will lapse with respect to a pro rata portion of the contingent units on the
date of termination. Termination due to any other reason will result in all contingent units
awarded being forfeited effective the employee’s date of termination. Employees will be entitled
to receive dividends upon vesting. As of December 31, 2010, 652,817 nonvested contingent stock
units were granted and outstanding for the 2010 award.

In 2009, NiSource granted 940,707 contingent stock units subject to performance conditions. The
grant date fair-value of the awards was $7.0 million, based on the average market price of
NiSource’s common stock at the date of each grant less the present value of dividends not received
during the vesting period which will be expensed, net of forfeitures, over the three year requisite
service period. The performance conditions are based on achievement
of


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

non-GAAP financial
measures: cumulative net operating earnings, that NiSource defines as income from continuing
operations adjusted for certain items; cumulative funds from operations that NiSource defines as
net operating cash flows provided by continuing operations; and total debt that NiSource defines as
total debt adjusted for significant movement in natural gas prices and other adjustments determined
by the Board. The service conditions lapse on January 31, 2012 when 100% of the shares vest. If
the employee terminates employment before January 31, 2012 (1) due to retirement, having attained
age 55 and completed ten years of service, or (2) due to death or disability, the employment
conditions will lapse with respect to a pro rata portion of the contingent units on the date of
termination. Termination due to any other reason will result in all contingent units awarded being
forfeited effective the employee’s date of termination. Employees will be entitled to receive
dividends upon vesting. As of December 31, 2010, 914,476 nonvested contingent stock units were
granted and outstanding for the 2009 award.

In 2008, NiSource granted 417,196 contingent stock units subject to performance conditions. The
total grant date fair value of the awards was $6.2 million, based on the average market price of
NiSource’s common stock at the date of each grant less the present value of dividends not received
during the vesting period, which will be expensed, net of forfeitures, over the vesting period of
approximately three years. The performance conditions are based on achievement of non-GAAP
financial measures (cumulative net operating earnings and cumulative funds from
operations). Per the agreement, to the extent base performance conditions are exceeded during the
three year performance period, the award will be increased in increments of 10% up to 50%. If
prior to the lapse of the performance conditions, the employee terminates employment (1) due to
retirement, having attained age 55 and completed ten years of service, (2) due to disability, or
(3) due to death with less than or equal to 12 months remaining in the performance period, the
employee will receive a pro rata portion of the contingent shares if the performance conditions
have been met. If prior to the lapse of the performance conditions, the employee terminates
employment due to death with more than 12 months remaining in the performance period, the employee
will receive a pro rata portion of the contingent shares as if the performance conditions had been
met. Termination due to any other reason will result in all contingent units awarded being
forfeited effective the employee’s date of termination. Employees will be entitled to receive
dividends upon vesting. During the fourth quarter of 2009 it became probable that the performance
condition would not be met for one half of the award. Expense related to this portion of the award
was reversed in the fourth quarter and will no longer be amortized going forward. Also during the
fourth quarter of 2009 it became probable that the base performance condition would be exceeded for
one half of the award, thereby increasing the number of shares probable to be issued upon vesting
by 50% for this portion of the award. Additional expense related to the increase in probable
shares was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2009 and will continue to be amortized over the
remainder of the vesting period. As of December 31, 2010, 410,335 nonvested contingent stock units
were granted and outstanding for the 2008 award.

Non-employee Director Awards

. Effective on May 11, 2010, the stockholders approved the NiSource
Inc. 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Plan”). The Omnibus Plan provides for awards to
employees and non-employee directors of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance shares, performance
units, cash-based awards and other stock-based awards. As of May 11, 2010, awards to non-employee
directors may be made only under the Omnibus Plan. Restricted stock units granted to non-employee
directors in 2010 were immediately vested and are payable six months following separation from
service on the Board. As of December 31, 2010, 50,611 restricted stock units had been issued under
the Omnibus Plan.

Only restricted stock units remain outstanding under the prior plan for non-employee directors,
(the Amended and Restated Non-employee Director Stock Incentive Plan, the “Plan”). All such awards
are fully vested and shall be distributed to the directors upon their separation from the Board.
As of December 31, 2010, 281,455 restricted stock units remain issued under the Plan and as noted
above no further shares may be issued under this plan.

401 (k) Match, Profit Sharing and Company Contribution.

NiSource has a voluntary 401(k) savings
plan covering eligible employees that allows for periodic discretionary matches as a percentage of
each participant’s contributions in newly issued shares of common stock. NiSource also has a
retirement savings plan that provides for discretionary profit sharing contributions of shares of
common stock to eligible employees based on earnings results and effective January 1, 2010,
eligible employees receive a non-elective company contribution of three percent of eligible pay in

Long-Term Debt

NiSource Finance is a wholly-owned, consolidated finance subsidiary of NiSource that engages in
financing activities to raise funds for the business operations of NiSource and its subsidiaries.
NiSource Finance was incorporated in February 2000 under the laws of the state of Indiana. Prior to
2000, the function of NiSource Finance was performed by Capital Markets. NiSource Finance and
Capital Markets’ obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NiSource. Consequently no
separate financial statements for NiSource Finance or Capital Markets are required to be reported.
No other NiSource subsidiaries guarantee debt.

On December 8, 2010, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 6.25% senior unsecured notes that
mature December 15, 2040.

On December 1, 2010, NiSource Finance announced that it was commencing a cash tender offer for up
to $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 and 6.80%
notes due 2019. A condition of the offering was that all validly tendered 2016 notes would be
accepted for purchase before any 2019 notes were accepted. On December 14, 2010, NiSource Finance
announced that approximately $272.9 million of the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding
10.75% notes due 2016 were validly tendered. Based upon the principal amount of the 2016 notes
tendered, NiSource Finance increased the maximum aggregate principal amount of 2016 notes it would
purchase from $250.0 million to $325.0 million and terminated the portion of the tender offer
related to its 6.80% notes due 2019. On December 30, 2010, NiSource Finance announced that $273.1
million of these notes were successfully tendered. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 470,

as a debt extinguishment. NiSource recorded a
$96.7 million loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt, primarily attributable to early
redemption premiums and unamortized discounts and fees.

On November 15, 2010, NiSource Finance redeemed $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes.

On December 4, 2009, NiSource Finance issued $500.0 million of 6.125% senior unsecured notes that
mature March 1, 2022.

During November 2009, NiSource Finance redeemed $417.6 million of its floating rate notes.

On April 9, 2009, NiSource Finance closed a $385.0 million senior unsecured two-year bank term loan
with a scheduled maturity of February 11, 2011. Borrowings under the bank term loan had an
effective cost of LIBOR plus 538 basis points. Previously, on February 16, 2009, NiSource
announced the initial closing of the bank term loan at the level of $265.0 million. Under an
accordion feature, NiSource was able to increase the loan by $120.0 million prior to final closing.
On December 7, 2009, this term loan was repaid with proceeds from the December 4, 2009, $500.0
million debt offering.

On March 31, 2009, NiSource Finance commenced a cash tender offer for up to $300.0 million
aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 7.875% notes due 2010. On April 28, 2009, NiSource
Finance announced that $250.6 million of these notes were successfully tendered.

On March 9, 2009, NiSource Finance issued $600.0 million of 10.75% unsecured notes that mature
March 15, 2016.

During January 2009, NiSource repurchased $32.4 million of the $450.0 million floating rate notes
that were scheduled to mature in November 2009 and $67.6 million of the $1.0 billion 7.875%
unsecured notes scheduled to mature in November 2010.

During August 2008, after a series of negative events in the tax-exempt auction rate market,
Northern Indiana converted its Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds, having a total principal
value of $254 million, from variable rate demand mode to fixed rate demand mode. The weighted
average interest rate is now fixed at 5.58%.

On May 15, 2008, NiSource Finance issued $500.0 million of 6.80% unsecured notes that mature
January 15, 2019 and $200.0 million of 6.15% unsecured notes that mature on March 1, 2013. The
notes due in 2013 constitute a further issuance of the $345.0 million 6.15% notes issued February
19, 2003, and form a single series having an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $545.0
million.

Following are the outstanding long-term debt sinking fund requirements and maturities at December
31, 2010. The long-term debt maturities shown below include capital
lease obligations and the debt of certain low-income housing real estate investments. NiSource does not guarantee the

Unamortized debt expense, premium and discount on long-term debt applicable to outstanding bonds
are being amortized over the life of such bonds. Reacquisition premiums have been deferred and are
being amortized. These premiums are not earning a regulatory return during the recovery period.

Of NiSource’s long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2010, $109.0 million was issued by
NiSource’s subsidiary, Capital Markets. The financial obligations of Capital Markets are subject
to a Support Agreement between NiSource and Capital Markets, under which NiSource has committed to
make payments of interest and principal on Capital Markets’ obligations in the event of a failure
to pay by Capital Markets. Under the terms of the Support Agreement, in addition to the cash flow
from cash dividends paid to NiSource by any of its consolidated subsidiaries, the assets of
NiSource, other than the stock and assets of Northern Indiana, are available as recourse for the
benefit of Capital Markets’ creditors. The carrying value of the NiSource assets, excluding the
assets of Northern Indiana, was $14.6 billion at December 31, 2010.

NiSource Finance maintains $500.0 million notional value of interest rate swap agreements relating
to its outstanding long-term debt. The effect of these agreements is to modify the interest rate
characteristics of a portion of their respective long-term debt from fixed to variable. Refer to
Note 9, “Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information regarding interest rate swaps.

NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five-year revolving credit facility. This
covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A
similar covenant in the 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to
maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2010, the
ratio was 59.9%.

NiSource is also subject to certain other non-financial covenants under the revolving credit
facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on
NiSource’s assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests,
preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset
sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and/or transfer of NiSource’s assets to no more
than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the
fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource
Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all
other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility
also include a cross-default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit
facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any
of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more.

NiSource’s indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However,
NiSource’s indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured
payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on
NiSource’s assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests,
preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSource’s
consolidated net tangible assets.

Short-Term Borrowings

NiSource Finance maintains a $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of
banks which has a termination date of July 7, 2011. This facility provides a reasonable cushion of
short-term liquidity for general corporate purposes including meeting cash requirements driven by
volatility in natural gas prices, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. At December
31, 2010, NiSource had $1,107.5 million of outstanding borrowings under this facility.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, NiSource had $32.5 million and $87.8 million, respectively, of
stand-by letters of credit outstanding of which $14.2 million and $85.0 million were under the
five-year revolving credit facility. NiSource Finance maintains a five-year revolving line of
credit with a syndicate of financial institutions which can be used either for borrowings or the
issuance of letters of credit.

Price risk management assets and liabilities include commodity exchange-traded and
non-exchange-based derivative contracts. Exchange-traded derivative contracts are generally based
on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial
assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance
risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non-exchange-traded derivatives are
valued using broker or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges. In such cases, these
non-exchange-traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non-exchange-based derivative
instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may
utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments.
Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and
market-corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable
market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially
the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain
derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and
models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the
measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in
the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange-traded. Credit
exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures.

To determine the fair value of derivatives associated with NiSource’s unregulated natural gas
marketing business, certain reserves were calculated. These reserves were primarily determined by
evaluating the credit worthiness of certain customers, fair value of future cash flows, and the
cost of maintaining restricted cash. Refer to Note 9, “Risk Management and Energy Marketing
Activities” for additional information on price risk assets.

Price risk management assets also include fixed-to-floating interest-rate swaps, which are
designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable-rate debt as
a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future
outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current
fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well
as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are
based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest-rate swaps are
categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value
calculation of the interest rate swap.

Available-for-sale securities are investments pledged as collateral for trust accounts related to
NiSource’s wholly-owned insurance company. Available-for-sale securities are included within
“Other investments” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Securities classified within Level 1
include U.S. Treasury debt securities which are highly liquid and are actively traded in
over-the-counter markets. NiSource values corporate and mortgage-backed
debt securities using a matrix pricing model that incorporates market-based information. These
securities trade less frequently and are classified within Level 2. Unrealized gains and losses

As discussed in Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, part of the MISO Day 2
initiative, Northern Indiana obtains FTRs, which help to offset congestion costs due to the MISO
Day 2 activity. These instruments are considered derivatives and are classified as Level 3 and are
reflected in the table above. FTRs are valued based on the value of allocated ARRs and forecasted
congestion costs. Since congestion costs are recoverable through the fuel cost recovery mechanism,
the related gains and losses associated with marking these derivatives to market are recorded as a
regulatory asset or liability. Northern Indiana also writes options for regulatory incentive
purposes which are also considered in the Level 3 valuations. Realized gains and losses for these
Level 3 recurring items are included in income within Cost of Sales on the Statements of
Consolidated Income (Loss). Unrealized gains and losses from Level 3 recurring items are included
within Regulatory assets or Regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements

. There were no significant non-recurring fair value
measurements recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010.

For 2009, NiSource recognized $16.6 million in expense for an impairment charge related to the
assets of Lake Erie Land discussed in Note 3, “Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges.” The
total impairment charge is comprised of $8.8 million recognized due to the uncollectability of
certain receivables due from the original developer of the property and $7.8 million recognized due
to the current book value exceeding the estimated fair value of certain real estate property. The
fair value of the assets was based upon the appraised value of certain real estate property. These
measurements are considered Level 3 valuations as several of the inputs used in the appraisal were
unobservable. In prior reporting periods, the assets of Lake Erie Land were measured based on the
purchase price contained in the purchase agreement entered into with the original developer in
2005.

NDC Douglas Properties, a subsidiary of NiSource Development Company, is in the process of exiting
some of its low income housing investments. During the third quarter of 2009 a potential buyer was
able to secure financing to purchase two properties previously recorded as assets held for sale as
well as three additional properties. The expected proceeds from the sale of the five properties
were less than the net book value resulting in a pre-tax impairment charge of $4.5 million
recognized during the third quarter. The NDC Douglas Properties assets were valued based on the
anticipated adjusted purchase price included in the letter of intent which is an unobservable input
and is considered a Level 3 valuation.

NDC Douglas Properties owns four properties which do not currently meet the assets held for sale
criteria as their estimated sale date is greater than one year. Based on previous impairments
recorded on other NDC Douglas Properties, the properties were tested for impairment during the
third quarter of 2009. The test resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $4.4 million recognized
during the third quarter. The assets were valued based on a discounted cash flow model utilizing
estimated future cash flows which are unobservable inputs. The valuation is considered a Level 3
valuation.

The following table presents long-lived assets measured and recorded at fair value on NiSource’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet on a non-recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy

Other Fair Value Disclosures for Financial Instruments

. NiSource has certain financial
instruments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but nevertheless are recorded
at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature, including cash and
cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, customer deposits and
short-term borrowings. NiSource’s long-term borrowings are recorded at historical amounts unless
designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of
financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.

Investments

. NiSource has corporate owned life insurance which is measured and recorded at cash
surrender value. NiSource’s investments in corporate owned life insurance at December 31, 2010 and
2009 were $26.0 million and $23.7 million, respectively.

Long-term Debt

. The fair values of these securities are estimated based on the quoted market
prices for the same or similar issues or on the rates offered for securities of the same remaining
maturities. Certain premium costs associated with the early settlement of long-term debt are not
taken into consideration in determining fair value.

Transfers of Financial Assets

Beginning January 1, 2010, transfers of accounts receivable that previously qualified for sales
accounting no longer qualify and are accounted for as secured borrowings resulting in the
recognition of short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum amount of
debt that can be recognized related to NiSource’s accounts receivable programs is $475.0 million.

Prior to January 1, 2010, NiSource’s accounts receivable programs qualified for sale accounting
based upon the conditions met in ASC Topic 860,

Transfers and Servicing

.

All accounts receivables sold to the commercial paper conduits are valued at face value, which
approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The amount of the undivided percentage
ownership interest in the accounts receivables sold is determined in part by required loss reserves
under the agreements. Below is information about the accounts receivable securitization agreements
entered into by NiSource’s subsidiaries.

On October 23, 2009, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse,
substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CGORC, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Columbia of Ohio. CGORC, in turn, is party to an agreement with BTMU and RBS, also dated
October 23, 2009, under the terms of which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in
its accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit sponsored by
BTMU and RBS. On October 22, 2010, the agreement was renewed with an amendment reducing the
maximum seasonal programs limit from $275 million to $200 million. The amended agreement expires
on October 21, 2011, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by all parties. As of December 31,
2010, $113.2 million of accounts receivable had been transferred by CGORC. CGORC is a separate
corporate entity from NiSource and Columbia of Ohio, with its own separate obligations, and upon a
liquidation of CGORC, CGORC’s obligations must be satisfied out of CGORC’s assets prior to any
value becoming available to CGORC’s stockholder. Under the agreement, an event of termination
occurs if NiSource’s debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s, or falls
below BB- or Ba3 at either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s, respectively.

On October 23, 2009, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse,
substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NARC, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Northern Indiana. NARC, in turn, is party to an agreement with RBS, also dated October 23,
2009, under the terms of which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in its accounts
receivable to a commercial paper conduit sponsored by RBS. The maximum seasonal program limit
under the terms of the agreement is $200 million. On October 22, 2010, the agreement was renewed,
having a new scheduled termination date of August 31, 2011, and can be renewed if mutually agreed
to by both parties. As of December 31, 2010, $115.2 million of accounts receivable had been
transferred by NARC. NARC is a separate corporate entity from NiSource and Northern Indiana, with
its own separate obligations, and upon a liquidation of NARC, NARC’s obligations must be satisfied
out of NARC’s assets prior to any value becoming available to NARC’s stockholder. Under the
agreement, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indiana’s debt rating is withdrawn by either
Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s, or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s,
respectively.

On March 15, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse,
substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CPRC, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Columbia of Pennsylvania. CPRC, in turn, is party to an agreement with BTMU, also dated March
15, 2010, under the terms of which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in its
accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit sponsored by BTMU. The maximum seasonal program
limit under the terms of the agreement is $75 million. CPRC’s agreement with the commercial paper
conduit has a scheduled termination of March 14, 2011, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by
both parties. As of December 31, 2010, $46.6 million of accounts receivable has been transferred
by CPRC. CPRC is a separate corporate entity from NiSource and Columbia of Pennsylvania, with its
own separate obligations, and upon a liquidation of CPRC, CPRC’s obligations must be satisfied out
of CPRC’s assets prior to any value becoming available to CPRC stockholder. Under the agreement,
an event of termination occurs if NiSource’s debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poor’s
or Moody’s, or falls below BB- or Ba3 at either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s, respectively.

The following tables reflect the gross and net receivables transferred as well as short-term
borrowings related to the securitization transactions as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

proceeds from receivables sold of $2,808.4 million, remitted collections to
the commercial paper conduits of $2,923.4 million and repurchased receivables of $133.1 million.
This resulted in a net use of operating cash flows of $248.1 million. Additionally, for the year
ended December 31, 2009, $8.9 million of fees associated with the securitization transactions were
recorded as other, net expense.

Beginning January 1, 2010, transfers of accounts receivable that previously qualified for sale
accounting no longer qualify and are accounted for as secured borrowings. As such, at December 31,
2010, the entire gross receivables balance remains on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
short-term borrowings are recorded in the amount of proceeds received from the commercial paper
conduits involved in the transactions. During 2010, $275.0 million
has been recorded as cash from financing activities related to the change in short-term borrowings
due to the securitization transactions. Although there have been no changes in the operation of
the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of the new accounting guidance
resulted in a reduction in cash from operations of $241.9 million. For the year ended December 31,
2010, $6.3 million of fees associated with the securitization transactions were recorded as
interest expense in accordance with the new accounting guidance. Columbia of Ohio, Northern
Indiana and Columbia of Pennsylvania remain responsible for collecting on the receivables
securitized and the receivables cannot be sold to another party.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

A.           Guarantees and Indemnities

. As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries
enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on
behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit.
These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise
attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient
credit to accomplish the subsidiaries’ intended commercial purposes. The total guarantees and
indemnities in existence at December 31, 2010 and the years in which they expire are:

Guarantees of Subsidiaries Debt

. NiSource has guaranteed the payment of $5.4 billion of debt
for various wholly-owned subsidiaries including NiSource Finance, and through a support agreement,
Capital Markets, which is reflected on NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The subsidiaries
are required to comply with certain financial covenants under the debt indenture and in the event
of default, NiSource would be obligated to pay the debt’s principal and related interest. NiSource
does not anticipate its subsidiaries will have any difficulty maintaining compliance.

Guarantees Supporting Commodity Transactions of Subsidiaries

. NiSource has issued guarantees,
which support up to approximately $194.5 million of commodity-related payments for its current
subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to
counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas.
To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity-related contracts subject to these guarantees,
such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Lines and Letters of Credit and Accounts Receivable Advances

. NiSource Finance maintains a $1.5
billion five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which has a termination date
of July 7, 2011. This facility provides a reasonable cushion of short-term liquidity for general
corporate purposes including meeting cash requirements driven by volatility in natural gas prices,
and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. NiSource currently intends to negotiate a new
revolving credit facility during the first quarter of 2011. At December 31, 2010, NiSource had
$1,107.5 million in borrowings under its five-year revolving
credit facility and $275.0 million

outstanding under its accounts receivable securitization agreements. At December 31, 2010,
NiSource issued stand-by letters of credit of approximately $32.5 million for benefit of third
parties. See Note 17, “Short-term Borrowings,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information.

Other Guarantees or Obligations

. On June 30, 2008, NiSource sold Whiting Clean Energy to BPAE for
$216.7 million which included $16.1 million in working capital. The agreement with BPAE contains
representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions. NiSource has executed purchase and
sales agreement guarantees totaling $220 million which guarantee performance of PEI’s covenants,
agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreement with BPAE.
No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010. These guarantees are due to expire in June
2013.

NiSource has additional purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $30.0 million, which
guarantee performance of the seller’s covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities,
representations and warranties under the
agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to
perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned
guarantees is remote.

NiSource provided a letter of credit to Union Bank N.A., as Collateral Agent for deposit into a
debt service reserve account as required under the Deposit and Disbursement Agreement governing the
Millennium Pipeline notes offering in conjunction with Millennium’s long-term debt refinancing.
This account is to be drawn upon by the note holders in the event that Millennium is delinquent on
its principal and interest payments. The obligation amount of NiSource’s letter of credit
represents 47.5% (NiSource’s ownership percentage in Millennium) of the Debt Service Reserve
Account requirement or $16.2 million. The total exposure for NiSource is $16.2 million. NiSource
recorded an accrued liability of $1.5 million related to the inception date fair value of this
guarantee as of December 31, 2010.

On June 29, 2006, Columbia Transmission, Piedmont, and Hardy Storage entered into multiple
agreements to finance the construction of the Hardy Storage project, which is accounted for by
NiSource as an equity investment. Under the financing agreement, Columbia Transmission issued
guarantees securing payment for 50% of any amounts issued in connection with Hardy Storage up until
such time as the project is placed in service and operated within certain specified parameters. As
of December 31, 2009, Hardy Storage had outstanding borrowings of $123.4 million under the
temporary financing agreement, for which Columbia Transmission had recorded an accrued liability of
approximately $1.2 million related to the fair value of its guarantee securing payment for $61.7
million which is 50% of the amount borrowed. Hardy Storage satisfied the terms and conditions of
its financing agreement on March 17, 2010, when Hardy Storage secured permanent financing,
facilitating Columbia Transmission’s release from its underlying guarantee and therefore, the
accrued liability of $1.2 million was relieved as of March 31, 2010.

NiSource has issued other guarantees supporting derivative related payments associated with
interest rate swap agreements issued by NiSource Finance, operating leases for many of its
subsidiaries and for other agreements entered into by its current and former subsidiaries.

B.           Other Legal Proceedings

. In the normal course of its business, NiSource and its subsidiaries
have been named as defendants in various legal proceedings. In the opinion of management, the
ultimate disposition of these currently asserted claims will not have a material adverse impact on
NiSource’s consolidated financial position.

Tawney, et al. v. Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., Roane County, WV Circuit Court

The Plaintiffs, who are West Virginia landowners, filed a lawsuit in early 2003 in the West
Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County, West Virginia (the “Trial Court”) against CNR alleging
that CNR underpaid royalties on gas produced on their land by improperly deducting post-production
costs and not paying a fair value for the gas. Plaintiffs also claimed that Defendants
fraudulently concealed the deduction of post-production charges. In December 2004, the Trial Court
granted Plaintiffs’ motion to add NiSource and Columbia as
Defendants. The Trial


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Court later
certified the case as a class action that includes any person who, after July 31, 1990, received or
is due royalties from CNR (and its predecessors or successors) on lands lying within the boundary
of the state of West Virginia. Although NiSource sold CNR in 2003, NiSource remained obligated to
manage this litigation and was responsible for the majority of any damages awarded to Plaintiffs.
On January 27, 2007, the jury hearing the case returned a verdict against all Defendants in the
amount of $404.3 million inclusive of both compensatory and punitive damages; Defendants
subsequently filed their Petition for Appeal, which was later amended, with the West Virginia
Supreme Court of Appeals (the “Appeals Court”), which refused the petition on May 22, 2008. On
August 22, 2008, Defendants filed Petitions to the United States Supreme Court for writ of
certiorari. Given the Appeals Court’s earlier refusal of the appeal, NiSource adjusted its reserve
in the second quarter of 2008 to reflect the portion of the Trial Court judgment for which NiSource
would be responsible, inclusive of interest. This amount was included in “Legal and environmental
reserves,” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008. On October 24, 2008, the
Trial Court preliminarily approved a Settlement Agreement with a total settlement amount of $380
million. The settlement received final approval by the Trial Court on November 22, 2008.
NiSource’s share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its
obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund
by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the
amount of $254 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the
settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. The Trial Court entered its Order
discharging the judgment on January 20, 2009 and is supervising the administration of the
settlement proceeds. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource has contributed a total of $330.5 million
into the qualified
settlement fund, $277.3 million of which was contributed prior to December 31, 2009. As of
December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability has not been paid. NiSource
has since contributed an additional $2.7 million in 2011. NiSource will be required to make
additional payments, pursuant to the settlement, upon notice from the Class Administrator.

John Thacker, et al. v. Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C., U.S. District Court, E.D. Kentucky Poplar
Creek Development Company v. Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C., U.S. District Court, E.D. Kentucky

On February 8, 2007, Plaintiff filed the Thacker case, a purported class action alleging that
Chesapeake has failed to pay royalty owners the correct amounts pursuant to the provisions of their
oil and gas leases covering real property located within the state of Kentucky. Columbia has
assumed the defense of Chesapeake in this matter pursuant to the provisions of the Stock Purchase
Agreement dated July 3, 2003, among Columbia, NiSource, and Triana Energy Holding, Inc.,
Chesapeake’s predecessor in interest (“Stock Purchase Agreement”). Plaintiffs filed an Amended
Complaint on March 19, 2007, which, among other things, added NiSource and Columbia as Defendants.
On March 31, 2008, the Court denied a Motion by Defendants to Dismiss and on June 3, 2008, the
Plaintiffs moved to certify a class consisting of all persons entitled to payment of royalty by
Chesapeake under leases operated by Chesapeake at any point after February 5, 1992, on real
property in Kentucky.

In June 2009, the parties to the Thacker litigation presented a Settlement Agreement to the Court
for preliminary approval. The court granted the Motion for Preliminary approval and held a
fairness hearing on November 10, 2009. On March 3, 2010 the Court granted final approval of the
settlement and on March 31, 2010 Poplar Creek filed a notice of appeal of that approval with the
Sixth Circuit. On February 17, 2011, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the
lower court’s approval of the settlement.

On October 9, 2008, Chesapeake tendered the Poplar Creek case to Columbia and Columbia
conditionally assumed the defense of this matter pursuant to the provisions of the Stock Purchase
Agreement. Poplar Creek also purports to be a class action covering royalty owners in the state of
Kentucky and alleges that Chesapeake has improperly deducted costs from the royalty payments; thus
there is some overlap of parties and issues between the Poplar Creek and Thacker cases. Chesapeake
filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings in December 2008, which was granted on July 2, 2009.
Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral argument was held on
December 9, 2010 for both the Thacker and Poplar Creek cases. On February 17, 2011, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the
lower court’s decision.

Environmental Protection Agency Notice of Violation

On September 29, 2004, the EPA issued an NOV to Northern Indiana for alleged violations of the CAA
and the Indiana SIP. The NOV alleges that modifications were made to certain boiler units at three
of Northern Indiana’s generating stations between the years 1985 and 1995 without obtaining
appropriate air permits for the modifications.

Northern Indiana, EPA, the Department of Justice, and IDEM have agreed to settle the NOV.

The parties’ settlement is memorialized in a consent decree that was lodged in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Indiana on January 13, 2011. The consent decree covers
Northern Indiana’s four coal generating stations: Bailly, Michigan City, R.M. Schahfer, and D.H.
Mitchell. Northern Indiana must surrender environmental permits for D.H. Mitchell’s coal-fired
boilers, which have not been used to generate power since 2002. At the other generating stations,
Northern Indiana must install additional control equipment, including three new sulfur dioxide
(“SO2”) control devices and one new nitrogen oxide (“NOx”) control device. The consent decree also
imposes emissions limits for NOx, SO2, and particulate, and annual tonnage limits for NOx and SO2.
In addition, Northern Indiana must surrender certain NOx and SO2 allowances, pay fines of $3.5
million, and invest $9.5 million in environmental mitigation projects. Northern Indiana is
estimating the cost of NSR related capital improvements at $550.0 to $650.0 million, which will be
expended between 2010 and 2018. Northern Indiana believes the capital costs will likely be
recoverable from ratepayers.

C.           Tax Matters

. NiSource records liabilities for potential income tax assessments. The accruals
relate to tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on management’s estimate
of the ultimate resolution of these positions. These liabilities may be affected by changing
interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, or the expiration of the statute of
limitations. NiSource is a part of the IRS’s Large and Mid-Size Business program. As a result,
each year’s federal income tax return is typically audited by the IRS. The audits of all tax years
through 2004 have been completed and are closed to further assessment. The IRS audit of years
2005, 2006 and 2007 began on December 2, 2009. As of December 31, 2010, there were no state income
tax audits in progress that would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

NiSource is currently being audited for sales and use tax compliance in the states of Virginia,
Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maine and Massachusetts.

D.           Environmental Matters.

NiSource operations are subject to environmental statutes and regulations related to air quality,
water quality, hazardous waste and solid waste. NiSource believes that it is in substantial
compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to its operations and believes
that it has all necessary permits to conduct its operations.


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

It is management’s continued intent to address environmental issues in cooperation with regulatory
authorities in such a manner as to achieve mutually acceptable compliance plans. However, there
can be no assurance that fines and penalties will not be incurred. Management expects a
significant portion of environmental assessment and remediation costs to be recoverable through
rates for certain NiSource companies.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, NiSource had recorded reserves of approximately $79.8 million and
$76.4 million, respectively, to cover environmental remediation at various sites. NiSource accrues
for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs
is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The original estimates for cleanup can
differ materially from the amount ultimately expended. The actual future expenditures depend on
many factors, including currently enacted laws and regulations, the nature and extent of
contamination, the method of cleanup, and the availability of cost recovery from customers. These
expenditures are not currently estimable at some sites. NiSource periodically adjusts its reserves
as information is collected and estimates become more refined.

Air

The actions listed below could require further reductions in emissions from various emission
sources. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in these matters.

Climate Change.

Future legislative and regulatory programs could significantly restrict emissions
of GHGs or could impose a cost or tax on GHG emissions. Recently, proposals have been developed to
implement Federal, state and regional GHG programs and to create renewable energy standards.

In 2009 and 2010, the United States Congress considered a number of legislative proposals to
regulate GHG emissions. The United States House of Representatives passed a comprehensive climate
change bill in June 2009 that would have created a GHG-cap-and trade system and implemented
renewable energy standards. Bills on the same topics were introduced in the Senate in 2009 and
2010, but failed to garner enough support to pass.

If a Federal or state comprehensive climate change bill were to be enacted into law, the impact on
NiSource’s financial performance would depend on a number of factors, including the overall level
of required GHG reductions, the renewable energy targets, the degree to which offsets may be used
for compliance, the amount of recovery allowed from customers, and the extent to which NiSource
would be entitled to receive CO


allowances at no cost. Comprehensive Federal or state
GHG regulation could result in additional expense or compliance costs that may not be fully
recoverable from customers and could materially impact NiSource’s financial results.

National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

The CAA requires EPA to set national air quality standards
for particulate matter and five other pollutants (the NAAQS) considered harmful to public health
and the environment. Periodically EPA imposes new or modifies existing NAAQS. States that contain
areas that do not meet the new or revised standards must take steps to maintain or achieve
compliance with the standards. These steps could include additional pollution controls on boilers,
engines, turbines, and other facilities owned by electric generation, gas distribution, and gas
transmission operations.

The following NAAQS were recently added or modified:

Particulate Matter:

In 2006, the EPA issued revisions to the NAAQS for particulate matter. The
final rule (1) increased the stringency of the current fine particulate (PM2.5) standard, (2) added
a new standard for inhalable coarse particulate (particulate matter between 10 and 2.5 microns in
diameter), and (3) revoked the annual standards for coarse particulate (PM10) while retaining the
24-hour PM10 standards. These actions were challenged in a case before the DC Court of Appeals,

American Farm Bureau Federation et al. v. EPA.

In 2009, the appeals court granted portions of the
plaintiffs’ petitions challenging the fine particulate standards but denied portions of the
petitions challenging the standards for coarse particulate. State plans implementing the new
standard for inhalable coarse particulate and the modified 24-hour standard for fine particulate
are expected in 2012. The annual and secondary PM2.5 standards have been remanded to the EPA for
reconsideration.


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Ozone (eight hour):

On March 12, 2008, the EPA announced the tightening of the eight-hour ozone
NAAQS. EPA has yet to announce the classification structure and the corresponding attainment dates
for the new standard. On September 16, 2009, the EPA announced it would reconsider the March 2008
tightening of the ozone NAAQS and if needed promulgate more stringent standards. If the standards
are tightened and area designations subsequently changed, new SIPs will need to be developed by the
states within three years to bring the nonattainment areas into compliance. NiSource will continue
to closely monitor developments in these matters and cannot estimate the impact of these rules at
this time.

Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2):

The EPA revised the NO2 NAAQS by adding a one-hour standard while
retaining the annual standard. The new standard could impact some NiSource combustion sources.
EPA will designate areas that do not meet the new standard beginning in 2012. States with areas
that do not meet the standard will need to develop rules to bring areas into compliance within five
years of designation. Additionally, under certain permitting circumstances emissions from some
existing NiSource combustion sources may need to be assessed and compared to the revised NO2
standards before areas are designated. Petitions challenging the rule have been filed by various
parties. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in
these matters and cannot estimate the impact of these rules at this
time. For example, with respect to Columbia Gulf, capital costs could
exceed $50 million depending on the final outcome of the standard.

National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants.

On August 20, 2010, the EPA revised
national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for certain stationary reciprocating
internal combustion engines. Compliance requirements vary by engine type and will generally be
required within three years. NiSource is continuing its evaluation of the final rule and the
specific requirements to ensure compliance by the 2013 deadline and currently estimates the cost of
compliance in the range of $20 - $25 million.

Waste

NiSource subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties at waste disposal sites under the CERCLA
(commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws. Additionally, a program has been instituted
to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries or
predecessors may have liability. The program has identified up to 84 such sites and initial
investigations have been conducted at 56 sites. Follow-up investigation activities have been
completed or are in progress at 50 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed
at 37 sites. Remedial actions at many of these sites are being overseen by state or federal
environmental agencies through consent agreements or voluntary remediation agreements. The final
costs of cleanup have not yet been determined. As site investigations and cleanups proceed
reserves are adjusted to reflect new information.

Additional Issues Related to Individual Business Segments

The sections above describe various regulatory actions that affect Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations, Electric Operations, and certain other discontinued operations for which NiSource has
retained a liability. Specific information is provided below.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations.

Waste

Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific
sites under a 1995 AOC (subsequently modified in 1996 and 2007). The 1995 AOC originally covered
245 major facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury
measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As a result of the 2007 amendment,
approximately 50 facilities remain subject to the terms of the AOC.

One of the facilities subject to the 1995 AOC is the Majorsville Operations Center, which was
remediated under an EPA approved Remedial Action Work Plan in summer 2008. Pursuant to the
Remedial Action Work Plan, Columbia Transmission completed a project that stabilized residual oil
contained in soils at the site and in sediments in an adjacent stream. Columbia Transmission
continues to monitor the site subject to EPA oversight. On April 23, 2009, PADEP issued an NOV to
Columbia Transmission, alleging that the remediation did not fully address the contamination. The
NOV asserts violations of the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law and the
Pennsylvania Solid

Waste
Management Act and includes a proposed penalty of $1 million. Columbia Transmission is unable to
estimate the likelihood or cost of potential penalties or additional remediation at this time.

Electric Operations.

Air

Northern Indiana expects to become subject to a number of new air-quality mandates in the next several
years. These mandates would arise from new environmental regulations and from a Federal consent
decree and would require Northern Indiana to make capital improvements to its electric generating
stations. The cost of these improvements is estimated to be $560 to $800 million. Northern Indiana
expects that some or all of these costs will likely be recoverable from ratepayers.

NOx and Ozone Compliance:

Indiana’s rule to implement the EPA’s NOx SIP call requires reduction of
NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to reduce regional
transport of ozone. In response, Northern Indiana developed a NOx compliance plan, which included
the installation of Selective Catalytic Reduction and combustion control NOx reduction technology
at its active coal-fired generating stations and is currently in compliance with the NOx
requirements. In implementing the NOx compliance plan, Northern Indiana has expended approximately
$319.6 million as of December 31, 2010.

Sulfur dioxide:

On December 8, 2009, the EPA revised the SO2 NAAQS by adopting a new 1-hour
primary NAAQS for sulfur dioxide (SO2). EPA expects to designate areas that do not meet the new
standard by mid 2012. States with such areas would have until 2014 to develop attainment plans
with compliance required by 2017. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor developments
in these matters and cannot estimate their impact at this time.

Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) / Transport Rule:

On July 6, 2010, the EPA released its new
Transport Rule proposal, which would replace CAIR upon finalization. The EPA anticipates the rule
will become effective in summer 2011. The proposal contains three different approaches to govern
emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from electric generating units. The cost impact of
the Transport Rule would depend upon the specific requirements enacted. Northern Indiana will
continue to monitor this matter but believes the cost of compliance will be material.

Utility Hazardous Air Pollutants:

On February 8, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit vacated two EPA rules that are the basis for the Indiana Air Pollution
Control Board’s Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) that established utility mercury emission limits in
two phases (2010 and 2018) and a cap-and-trade program to meet those limits. In response to the
vacatur, the EPA is pursuing a new Section 112
rulemaking to establish MACT standards for electric utilities currently scheduled to be finalized
by November 2011. Northern Indiana will continue to monitor this matter but believes the cost of
compliance may be material.

New Source Review:

On September 29, 2004, the EPA issued an NOV to Northern Indiana for alleged
violations of the CAA and the Indiana SIP. The NOV alleges that modifications were made to certain
boiler units at three of Northern Indiana’s generating stations between the years 1985 and 1995
without obtaining appropriate air permits for the modifications. Northern Indiana, EPA, the
Department of Justice, and IDEM have agreed to settle the NOV.

The parties’ settlement is memorialized in a consent decree that was lodged in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Indiana on January 13, 2011. The consent decree covers
Northern Indiana’s four coal generating stations: Bailly, Michigan City, R.M. Schahfer, and D.H.
Mitchell. Northern Indiana must surrender environmental permits for D.H. Mitchell’s coal-fired
boilers, which have not been used to generate power since 2002. At the other generating stations,
Northern Indiana must install additional control equipment, including three new scrubbers to
control sulfur dioxide (“SO2”) and one new nitrogen oxide (“NOx”) control device. The consent
decree also imposes emissions limits for NOx, SO2, and particulate matter, and annual tonnage
limits for NOx and SO2. In addition, Northern Indiana must surrender certain NOx and SO2
allowances, pay fines of $3.5 million, and invest $9.5 million in environmental mitigation
projects. Northern Indiana is estimating the cost of NSR

capital improvements at $550.0 to
$650.0 million which will be expended between 2010 and 2018. Northern Indiana believes the capital
costs will likely be recoverable from ratepayers.

Water

The Phase II Rule of the Clean Water Act Section 316(b), which requires all large existing steam
electric generating stations to meet certain performance standards to reduce the effects on aquatic
organisms at their cooling water intake structures, became effective on September 7, 2004. Under
this rule, stations will either have to demonstrate that the performance of their existing fish
protection systems meet the new standards or develop new systems, such as a closed-cycle cooling
tower. Various court challenges and EPA responses ensued. As a result
of a December 3, 2010 settlement, the EPA is obligated to finalize a rule in 2012. The Bailly Generating Station is the only
Northern Indiana generating station that does not utilize closed cycle cooling. Northern Indiana
will continue to closely monitor this activity and cannot estimate the costs associated with the
ultimate outcome at this time.

Waste

On March 31, 2005, the EPA and Northern Indiana entered into an AOC under the authority of Section
3008(h) of the RCRA for the Bailly Station. The order requires Northern Indiana to identify the
nature and extent of releases of hazardous waste and hazardous constituents from the facility.
Northern Indiana must also remediate any release of hazardous constituents that present an
unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. The process to complete investigation and
select appropriate remediation activities is ongoing. The final costs of cleanup could change
based on EPA review.

On June 21, 2010, EPA published a proposed rule for coal combustion residuals through the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The proposal outlines multiple regulatory approaches that
EPA is considering. These proposed regulations could negatively affect Northern Indiana’s ongoing
byproduct reuse programs and would impose additional requirements on its management of coal ash
wastes. Northern Indiana will continue to monitor developments in this matter and cannot estimate
the potential financial impact at this time but believes that the cost of compliance under one of
the scenarios could be as much as $70 million of capital improvements in the first 5 years.
Northern Indiana expects that some or all of these costs may be recoverable from ratepayers.

Other Operations.

Waste

NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liabilities, including cleanup liabilities
associated with some of its former operations. Four sites are associated with its former propane
operations and ten sites associated with former petroleum operations. At one of those sites, an
AOC has been signed with EPA to address petroleum residue in soil and groundwater.

E.           Operating and Capital Lease Commitments.

NiSource leases assets in several areas of its
operations. Payments made in connection with operating leases were $56.7 million in 2010, $56.2
million in 2009 and $57.3 million in 2008, and are primarily charged to operation and maintenance
expense as incurred. Capital leases and
related accumulated depreciation included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $76.4 million and
$22.5 million at December 31, 2010, and $1.4 million and $0.3 million at December 31, 2009,
respectively.

NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline
business software requiring semi-annual payments of $2.9 million over 10 years, which began in
January 2008. This agreement is recorded as a capital lease.

Purchase and Service Obligations

. NiSource has entered into various purchase and service
agreements whereby NiSource is contractually obligated to make certain minimum payments in future
periods. NiSource’s purchase obligations are for the purchase of physical quantities of natural
gas, electricity and coal. NiSource’s service agreements encompass a broad range of business
support and maintenance functions which are generally described below.

NiSource’s subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical
quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent minimum quantities of
these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices.

In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indiana’s proposed purchase power
agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC.
These agreements provided Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw
of wind power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw
of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the
variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are
included in the table below. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any
reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern
Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events
giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination.

NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and
storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2045, require
NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges.

On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide
business process and support functions to NiSource. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay
IBM for the amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable
charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Under the amended Agreement, at
December 31, 2010, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $400 million to IBM in
service fees over the remaining 4.5 year term. In February, 2011, NiSource elected to reduce
certain services which will effectively lower the service obligation by approximately $30.0
million. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material
breach by IBM), NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a
breakage fee, repayment of IBM’s un-recovered capital investments, and IBM wind-down expense. This
termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and
the timing of the termination.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business
process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries
through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate
Services pays for the services
under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on
actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource
Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $53.7 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service
fees over the remaining 4.5 year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any
reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a
termination charge not to exceed $12.4 million.

Northern Indiana has contracts with three major rail operators providing for coal transportation
services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various
periods through 2013.

Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products
and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under
this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a
combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various
performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana
terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty-year contract period.

Equity Investment

During 2008, Millennium, in which Columbia Transmission has an equity investment, entered into
three interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling $420.0 million with seven
counterparties. During August 2010, Millennium completed the refinancing of its long-term debt,
securing permanent fixed-rate financing through the private placement issuance of two tranches of
notes totaling $725.0 million, $375.0 million at 5.33% due June 30, 2027 and $350.0 million at
6.00% due June 30, 2032. Upon the issuance of these notes, Millennium repaid all outstanding
borrowings under the credit agreement, terminated the sponsor guarantee, and cash settled the
interest rate hedges. These interest rate swap derivatives were primarily accounted for as cash
flow hedges by Millennium. As an equity method investment, NiSource is required to recognize a
proportional share of Millennium’s OCI. The remaining unrealized loss of $21.1 million, net of tax,
related to these terminated interest rate swaps is being amortized into earnings using the
effective interest method through interest expense as interest payments are made by Millennium. The
unrealized losses of $21.1 million and $5.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009,
respectively, are included in unrealized losses on cash flow hedges above.

24.          Segments of Business

Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is
available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate
resources and assess performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating
decision maker.

At December 31, 2010, NiSource’s operations are divided into three primary business segments. The
Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for
residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky,
Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas
transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers
located in northeastern, mid-Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia.
The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of
Indiana.

In prior period filings, NiSource reported Other Operations, which primarily included ventures
focused on its unregulated natural gas marketing business and distributed power generation
technologies, including fuel cells and storage systems, as a reporting segment. In the first
quarter of 2010, NiSource made a decision to wind down the unregulated natural gas marketing
activities as a part of the company’s long-term strategy of focusing on its core regulated
businesses. As a result, Other Operations no longer met the definition of a reporting segment and,
accordingly, has been included within Corporate and Other in the table below beginning in 2010 and
for all periods presented.

The following table provides information about business segments. NiSource uses operating income as
its primary measurement for each of the reported segments and makes decisions on finance, dividends
and taxes at the corporate level on a consolidated basis. Segment revenues include intersegment
sales to affiliated subsidiaries, which are eliminated in consolidation. Affiliated sales are
recognized on the basis of prevailing market, regulated prices or at levels provided for under
contractual agreements. Operating income is derived from revenues and expenses directly associated
with each segment.

During the first quarter of 2010, NDC Douglas Properties, a subsidiary of NiSource Development Company reported some if its low income housing investments
as discontinued operations. During the second quarter of 2010, these investments were reclassified to held and used and continuing operations and prior quarters
were accordingly restated as continuing operations.

•

In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource repurchased 273.1 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 pursuant to a cash tender
offer. As a result of this tender offer, NiSource incurred $96.7 million in early redemption fees, primarily attributable to early redemption premiums and
unamortized discounts and fees which is recorded as a loss on the early extinguishment of long-term debt within income from continuing operations.

•

During the second and third quarters of 2009, NiSource’s unregulated natural gas marketing business activity was reported as discontinued operations. During
the fourth quarter of 2009, NiSource reclassified its unregulated natural gas marketing business activity to held and used and continuing operations and

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

NiSource’s chief executive officer and its principal financial officer, after evaluating the
effectiveness of NiSource’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)), have concluded based on the evaluation required by paragraph (b) of
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 that, as of the end of the period covered by this report,
NiSource’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that
financial information was processed, recorded and reported accurately.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

NiSource management, including NiSource’s principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, are responsible for establishing and maintaining NiSource’s internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. However, management would note that a control system can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
NiSource’s management has adopted the framework set forth in the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission report, Internal Control - Integrated Framework, the most
commonly used and understood framework for evaluating internal control over financial reporting, as
its framework for evaluating the reliability and effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. During 2010, NiSource conducted an evaluation of its internal control over financial
reporting. Based on this evaluation, NiSource management concluded that NiSource’s internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual
report.

Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by NiSource in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to NiSource’s
management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, NiSource’s independent registered public accounting firm, issued an
attestation report on NiSource’s internal controls over financial reporting which is contained in
Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Changes in Internal Controls

There have been no changes in NiSource’s internal control over financial reporting during the
fiscal year covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect,
