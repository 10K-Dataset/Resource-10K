NiSource Inc. is an energy holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 whose subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving approximately

4.0

million customers in seven states. NiSource is the successor to an Indiana corporation organized in 1987 under the name of NIPSCO Industries, Inc., which changed its name to NiSource on April 14, 1999.

NiSource is one of the nation’s largest natural gas distribution companies, as measured by number of customers. NiSource’s principal subsidiaries include NiSource Gas Distribution Group, Inc., a natural gas distribution holding company, and NIPSCO, a gas and electric company. NiSource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating results of these rate-regulated businesses.

On September 13, 2018, a series of fires and explosions occurred in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, Massachusetts related to the delivery of natural gas by Columbia of Massachusetts (referred to herein as the “Greater Lawrence Incident”). The Greater Lawrence Incident resulted in one fatality and a number of injuries, damaged multiple homes and businesses, and caused the temporary evacuation of significant portions of each municipality. The Massachusetts Governor’s Office declared a state of emergency, authorizing the Massachusetts DPU to order another utility company to coordinate the restoration of utility services in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover. The incident resulted in the interruption of gas for approximately

7,500

gas meters, the majority of which served residences and approximately


of which served businesses, and the interruption of other utility service more broadly in the area. Columbia of Massachusetts has replaced the cast iron and bare steel gas pipeline system in the affected area and restored service to nearly all of the gas meters. Refer to Note 6, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," Note


-C. "Legal Proceedings," and E. "Other Matters," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

On February 26, 2020, NiSource and Columbia of Massachusetts (together with NiSource, “Seller”) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") with Eversource, a Massachusetts voluntary association.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement, NiSource and Columbia of Massachusetts agreed to sell to Eversource, with certain additions and exceptions: (1) substantially all of the assets of Columbia of Massachusetts and (2) all of the assets held by any of Columbia of Massachusetts’ affiliates that primarily relate to the business of storing, distributing or transporting natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers in Massachusetts, as conducted by Columbia of Massachusetts, and Eversource agreed to assume certain liabilities of Columbia of Massachusetts and its affiliates. The liabilities assumed by Eversource under the Asset Purchase Agreement do not include, among others, any liabilities arising out the Greater Lawrence Incident or liabilities of Columbia of Massachusetts or its affiliates pursuant to civil claims for injury of persons or damage to property to the extent such injury or damage occurs prior to the closing in connection with the Massachusetts Business. The Asset Purchase Agreement provides for a purchase price of $1,100 million in cash, subject to adjustment based on Columbia of Massachusetts’ net working capital as of the closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement is subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and regulatory approvals, resolution of certain proceedings before governmental bodies and other conditions.  For additional information, see Note


, “Subsequent Event,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

NiSource’s reportable segments are: Gas Distribution Operations and Electric Operations. The following is a summary of the business for each reporting segment. Refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note


, "Segments of Business," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information for each segment.

Gas Distribution Operations

Our natural gas distribution operations serve approximately 3.5 million customers in seven states and operate approximately 60,000 miles of pipeline located in our service areas described below. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary NiSource Gas Distribution Group, Inc., we own six distribution subsidiaries that provide natural gas to approximately 2.7 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland and Massachusetts. Additionally, we distribute natural gas to approximately 839,000 customers in northern Indiana through our wholly-owned subsidiary NIPSCO.

Electric Operations

We generate, transmit and distribute electricity through our subsidiary NIPSCO to approximately 476,000 customers in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana and engage in wholesale and transmission transactions. NIPSCO owns and operates two coal-fired electric generating stations: four units at R.M. Schahfer located in Wheatfield, IN and one unit at Michigan City located in Michigan City, IN. The two operating facilities have a generating capacity of 2,080 MW. NIPSCO also owns and operates Sugar Creek, a CCGT plant located in West Terre Haute, IN with generating capacity of 571 MW, three gas-fired generating units located at NIPSCO’s coal-fired electric generating stations with a generating capacity of 186 MW and two hydroelectric generating plants with a generating capacity of 10 MW: Oakdale located at Lake Freeman in Carroll County, IN and Norway located at Lake Schahfer in White County, IN. These facilities provide for a total system operating generating capacity of 2,847 MW.

.

In May 2018, NIPSCO completed the retirement of two coal-burning units (Units 7 and 8) at Bailly Generating Station, located in Chesterton, IN. These units had a generating capacity of approximately 460 MW.

NIPSCO’s transmission system, with voltages from 69,000 to 765,000 volts, consists of 3,005 circuit miles. NIPSCO is interconnected with five neighboring electric utilities.  During the year ended December 31, 2019, NIPSCO generated 62.4% and purchased 37.6% of its electric requirements.

NIPSCO participates in the MISO transmission service and wholesale energy market. MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC regulations to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Additionally, MISO is responsible for managing energy markets, transmission constraints and the day-ahead, real-time, FTR and ancillary markets. NIPSCO transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO, and transmission service for NIPSCO occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff.

Business Strategy

We focus our business strategy on our core, rate-regulated asset-based businesses with most of our operating income generated from the rate-regulated businesses. Our utilities continue to move forward on core infrastructure and environmental investment programs supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives across all seven states in which we operate. Our goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as we address changing customer conservation patterns, develop more contemporary pricing structures, and embark on long-term investment programs. These strategies are intended to improve reliability and safety, enhance customer service and reduce emissions while generating sustainable returns.

In its 2018 Integrated Resource Plan submission to the IURC, NIPSCO laid out a plan to retire the R.M. Schahfer Generating Station (Units 14, 15, 17, and 18) by 2023 and Michigan City Generating Station (Unit 12) by 2028. These units represent 2,080 MW of generating capacity, equal to 72% of NIPSCO’s remaining capacity after the retirement of Bailly Units 7 and 8 in May of 2018. The current replacement plan includes renewable sources of energy, including wind, solar, and battery storage to be obtained through a combination of NIPSCO ownership and PPAs. Refer to Note


-E, "Other Matters," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these plans.

Competition and Changes in the Regulatory Environment

The regulatory frameworks applicable to our operations, at both the state and federal levels, continue to evolve. These changes have had and will continue to have an impact on our operations, structure and profitability. Management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this environment.

The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non-traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies’ service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies’ service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on-system services are offered by us to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such situations as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and their ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers.

Increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards has contributed to a long-term trend of declining average use per customer. Residential usage for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased primarily due to warmer weather in our operating area compared to the prior year. While historically rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput rather than in a fixed charge, operating costs are largely incurred on a fixed basis and do not fluctuate due to changes in customer usage. As a result, Gas Distribution Operations have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with costs incurred. Each of the states in which Gas Distribution Operations operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing changes to rate design. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a decoupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. Columbia of Massachusetts received regulatory approval of a decoupling mechanism which adjusts revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Columbia of Maryland and Columbia of Virginia have regulatory approval for a revenue normalization adjustment for certain customer classes, a decoupling mechanism whereby monthly revenues that exceed or fall short of approved levels are reconciled in subsequent months. In a prior base rate proceeding, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a pilot residential weather normalization adjustment. Columbia of Maryland, Columbia of Virginia and Columbia of Kentucky have had approval for a weather normalization adjustment

for many years. In a prior gas base rate proceeding, NIPSCO implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design.

Natural Gas Competition

.    Open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets. LDC customers and marketers can purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open, competitive market for gas supplies has emerged. This separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and LDCs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and LDCs. The LDCs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers. Our Gas Distribution Operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use our Gas Distribution Operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services.

Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor-owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service areas as well as other regulated and unregulated natural gas intra and interstate pipelines and other alternate fuels, such as propane and fuel oil. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity has traditionally been the strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia due to comparatively low electric rates. Natural gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane-based heating which has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market over the last few years. However, fuel oil and propane are more viable in today’s oil market.

Electric Competition

.    Indiana electric utilities generally have exclusive service areas under Indiana regulations, and retail electric customers in Indiana do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier.  NIPSCO faces non-utility competition from other energy sources, such as self-generation by large industrial customers and other distributed energy sources.

Seasonality

A significant portion of our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, revenues from gas sales are more significant, and during the cooling season, which is primarily June through September, revenues from electric sales are more significant, than in other months.

Other Relevant Business Information

Our customer base is broadly diversified, with no single customer accounting for a significant portion of revenues.

As of December 31, 2019, we had 8,363 employees of whom 3,219 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements for 96 employees are set to expire within one year.

For a listing of certain subsidiaries of NiSource refer to Exhibit 21.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

NISOURCE INC.

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.

We have substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition.

Our business is capital intensive and we rely significantly on long-term debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt, and on short-term borrowings to fund a portion of day-to-day business operations. We had total consolidated indebtedness of

$9,642.8 million

outstanding as of

December 31, 2019

. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:

•

limit our ability to borrow additional funds or increase the cost of borrowing additional funds;

•

reduce the availability of cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the business and the industries in which we operate;

•

lead parties with whom we do business to require additional credit support, such as letters of credit, in order for us to transact such business;

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that are less leveraged;

•

increase vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and

•

limit our ability to execute on our growth strategy, which is dependent upon access to capital to fund our substantial infrastructure investment program.

Some of our debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debt-to-capital ratios and cross-default provisions. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations.

A drop in our credit ratings could adversely impact our cash flows, results of operation, financial condition and liquidity.

The availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings. The credit rating agencies periodically review our ratings, taking into account factors such as our capital structure, earnings profile, and, in 2018 and 2019, the impacts of the TCJA and the Greater Lawrence Incident. We are committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings; however, there is no assurance we will be able to do so in the future.  Our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant.  Any negative rating action could adversely affect our ability to access capital at rates and on terms that are attractive.  A negative rating action could also adversely impact our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners, who may be less willing to extend credit or offer us similarly favorable terms as secured in the past under such circumstances.

Certain of our subsidiaries have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral in the form of cash, a letter of credit or other forms of security for new and existing transactions if the credit ratings of our or certain of our subsidiaries are dropped below investment grade.  These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of gas or power.  As of

December 31, 2019

, the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately

$72.1 million

. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business.

If our or certain of our subsidiaries' credit ratings were downgraded, especially below investment grade, financing costs and the principal amount of borrowings would likely increase due to the additional risk of our debt and because certain counterparties may require additional credit support as described above. Such amounts may be material and could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Losing investment grade credit ratings may also result in more restrictive covenants and reduced flexibility on repayment terms in debt issuances, lower share price and greater stockholder dilution from common equity issuances, in addition to reputational damage within the investment community.

We may not be able to execute our business plan or growth strategy, including utility infrastructure investments.

Business or regulatory conditions may result in us not being able to execute our business plan or growth strategy, including identified, planned and other utility infrastructure investments. Our customer and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned

.

results. Utility infrastructure investments may not materialize, may cease to be achievable or economically viable and may not be successfully completed.  Natural gas may cease to be viewed as an economically and environmentally attractive fuel. Certain groups and governmental entities may continue to oppose natural gas delivery and infrastructure investments because of perceived environmental impacts associated with the natural gas supply chain and end use. Energy conservation, energy efficiency, distributed generation, energy storage, policies favoring electric heat over gas heat and other factors may reduce demand for natural gas and energy.  Any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects.  Even if our business plan and growth strategy are executed, there is still risk of, among other things, human error in maintenance, installation or operations, shortages or delays in obtaining equipment, and performance below expected levels (in addition to the other risks discussed in this section).

Adverse economic and market conditions or increases in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity.

While the national economy is experiencing modest growth, we cannot predict how robust future growth will be or whether  it will be sustained. Deteriorating or sluggish economic conditions in our operating jurisdictions could adversely impact our ability to maintain or grow our customer base and collect revenues from customers, which could reduce revenue growth and increase operating costs. In addition, a rising interest rate environment may lead to higher borrowing costs, which may adversely impact reported earnings, cost of capital and capital holdings. Rising interest rates and negative market or company events may also result in a decrease in the price of our shares of common stock.

We rely on access to the capital markets to finance our liquidity and long-term capital requirements, including expenditures for our utility infrastructure and to comply with future regulatory requirements, to the extent not satisfied by the cash flow generated by our operations. We have historically relied on long-term debt and on the issuance of equity securities to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt, and on short-term borrowings to fund a portion of day-to-day business operations.  Successful implementation of our long-term business strategies, including capital investment, is dependent upon our ability to access the capital and credit markets, including the banking and commercial paper markets, on competitive terms and rates. An economic downturn or uncertainty, market turmoil, changes in tax policy, challenges faced by financial institutions, changes in our credit ratings, or a change in investor sentiment toward us or the utilities industry generally could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt.  Reduced access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows.  Refer to Note


, “Long-Term Debt,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to outstanding long-term debt and maturities of that debt.

If any of these risks or uncertainties limit our access to the credit and capital markets or significantly increase our cost of capital, it could limit our ability to implement, or increase the costs of implementing, our business plan, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity.

Capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings.

The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. We have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts as noted in Note


, "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns, which fall below our projected rates of return. A decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, which could potentially increase funding requirements. Further, the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions. In addition, lower asset returns result in increased expenses. Ultimately, significant funding requirements and increased pension or other postretirement benefit plan expense could negatively impact our results of operations and financial position.

The majority of our revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings.

Most of our revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level. As such, the revenues generated by us are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority. These rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues. Our financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs and investments.  In addition to our ongoing regulatory proceedings, the recovery of the Greater Lawrence pipeline replacement capital investment will be addressed in a future regulatory proceeding as discussed in Note


, "Other Commitments and Contingencies - E. Other Matters” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain, potentially lengthy and could be influenced by many factors, some of which may be outside of our control, including the cost of providing service, the necessity of expenditures, the quality of service, regulatory interpretations, customer intervention, economic conditions and the political environment.  Further, the rate orders are subject to appeal, which creates additional uncertainty as to the rates that will ultimately be allowed to be charged for services.  Additionally, the costs of complying with current and future changes in environmental and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations are expected to be significant, and their recovery through rates will also be contingent on regulatory approval.

Failure to adapt to advances in technology and manage the related costs could make us less competitive and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.

A key element of our business model is that generating power at central station power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive cost. We continue to research, plan for, and implement new technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption.  These technologies include renewable energy, distributed generation, energy storage, and energy efficiency. Advances in technology and changes in laws or regulations (including subsidization) are reducing the cost of these or other alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most central station power electric production or result in smaller-scale, more fuel efficient, and/or more cost-effective distributed generation.  This could cause power sales to decline and the value of our generating facilities to decline.  New technologies may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive and may result in the obsolescence of certain operating assets.

In addition, customers are increasingly expecting enhanced communications regarding their electric and natural gas services, which, in some cases, may involve additional investments in technology. We also rely on technology to adequately maintain key business records.

Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes, to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards, and to recover all, or a significant portion of, any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets. A failure by us to effectively adapt to changes in technology and manage the related costs could harm our ability to remain competitive in the marketplace for our products, services and processes and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

The Greater Lawrence Incident has materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident, we have incurred and will incur various costs and expenses as set forth in Note 6, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," Note


, "Other Commitments and Contingencies - C. Legal Proceedings," and “- E. Other Matters" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We are subject to inquiries and investigations by government authorities and regulatory agencies regarding the Greater Lawrence Incident, including the Massachusetts DPU and the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office. We are cooperating with all inquiries and investigations.  In addition, on February 26, 2020, the Company and Columbia of Massachusetts entered into agreements with the U.S. Attorney’s Office to resolve the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s investigation relating to the Greater Lawrence Incident, as described further below.

As more information becomes known, management's estimates and assumptions regarding the costs and expenses to be incurred and the financial impact of the Greater Lawrence Incident may change. A change in management’s estimates or assumptions could result in an adjustment that would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during the period in which such change occurred.

While we have recovered the full amount of our liability insurance coverage available under our policies, total expenses related to the incident have exceeded such amount. Expenses in excess of our liability insurance coverage have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

.

We may also incur additional costs associated with the Greater Lawrence Incident, beyond the amount currently anticipated, including in  connection with investigations by regulators as well as civil litigation. Further, state or federal legislation may be enacted that would require us to incur additional costs by mandating various changes, including changes to our operating practice standards for natural gas distribution operations and safety. If we are unable to recover the capital cost of the gas pipeline replacement in the impacted area or we incur a material amount of other costs that we are unable to recover through rates or offset through operational or other cost savings, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

Further, if it is determined in other matters that we did not comply with applicable statutes, regulations, rules, tariffs, or orders in connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident or in connection with the operations or maintenance of our natural gas system, and we are ordered to pay additional amounts in customer refunds, penalties, or other amounts, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

Our settlement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in respect of federal charges in connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident may expose us to further penalties, liabilities and private litigation, and may impact our operations.

On February 26, 2020, the Company entered into a DPA and Columbia of Massachusetts entered into a plea agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office to resolve the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s investigation relating to the Greater Lawrence Incident.   Columbia of Massachusetts’ plea agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office is subject to approval by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (the "Court").  If Columbia of Massachusetts’ guilty plea is not accepted by the Court or is withdrawn for any reason, the U.S. Attorney's Office may, at its sole option, render the DPA null and void.  See Note 19, “Other Commitments and Contingencies - C. Legal Proceedings” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The agreements impose various compliance and remedial obligations on the Company and Columbia of Massachusetts.  Failure to comply with the terms of these agreements could result in further enforcement action by the U.S. Attorney’s Office, expose the Company and Columbia of Massachusetts to penalties, financial or otherwise, and subjects the Company to further private litigation, each of which could impact our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business.

The closing of the sale of the Massachusetts Business is subject to receipt of clearance and approval from various governmental entities and other closing conditions that may not be satisfied or waived, and, in order to receive such clearance, consent or approval, governmental entities may impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions that Eversource is not obligated to accept in order to complete the transaction.

On February 26, 2020, NiSource, Columbia of Massachusetts and Eversource entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement providing for the sale of the Massachusetts Business to Eversource. The Asset Purchase Agreement provides for various closing conditions, including (a) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, (b) the receipt of the approval of the Massachusetts DPU (the “MDPU Approval”)  and (c) the final resolution or termination of all pending actions, claims and proceedings against Seller and its affiliates under the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts DPU and all future, actions, claims and proceedings against Seller and its affiliates relating to the Greater Lawrence Incident under the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts DPU.

The satisfaction of many of the closing conditions is beyond our control.  We may not receive the required clearance and approvals for the transaction or the required resolution with the Massachusetts DPU, or we may not receive them in a timely manner.  In addition, governmental entities could impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions as conditions for their approvals and as conditions to resolve certain proceedings, and these may include substantial payments by us. Moreover, Eversource is not required to agree to any conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions to obtain required clearance and approvals if such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions would reasonably be expected to constitute a “burdensome condition” as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement. There can be no assurance that regulators will not seek to impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions that would constitute burdensome conditions.

If the closing conditions are not satisfied or there is a substantial delay in obtaining the required clearance and approvals, or otherwise satisfying the closing conditions, the sale of the Massachusetts Business may not be completed, and we may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the sale.

The sale of the Massachusetts Business poses risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business, and we may not realize the expected benefits of the sale of the Massachusetts Business.

The sale of the Massachusetts Business involves separation or carve-out activities and costs and possible disputes with Eversource. Following the sale, we may have continued financial liabilities with respect to the business conducted by Columbia of Massachusetts,

as we will be required to retain responsibility for, and indemnify Eversource against, certain liabilities, including liabilities for any fines arising out of the Greater Lawrence Incident and liabilities of Columbia of Massachusetts or its affiliates pursuant to civil claims for injury of persons or damage to property to the extent such injury or damage occurs prior to the closing in connection with Columbia of Massachusetts’ business. It may also be difficult to determine whether a claim from a third party is our responsibility, and we may expend substantial resources trying to determine whether we or Eversource has responsibility for the claim.

If we do not realize the expected benefits of the sale of the Massachusetts Business, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. The sale of the Massachusetts Business may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the sale, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

The failure to complete the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement within the expected time frame or at all could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the price of our common stock.

If the sale of the Massachusetts Business is not completed by October 26, 2020 (subject to up to two automatic 45-day extensions under certain circumstances related to obtaining required regulatory approvals and resolution with the Massachusetts DPU), we or Eversource may choose not to proceed with the transaction. Completion of the transaction is subject to risks, including the risks that approval of the transaction by governmental entities will not be obtained or that certain other closing conditions will not be satisfied. A failure to complete the transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community.  Moreover, under the terms of the settlement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, we will be obligated to use reasonable best efforts to sell Columbia of Massachusetts’ business, and there is no assurance that we will be able to sell such business to a third party on as favorable terms, if at all.  The occurrence of any of these events, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or the trading price of our common stock.

Our gas distribution activities, as well as generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, including potential public safety risks.

Our gas distribution activities, as well as generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity, involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, including, but not limited to, gas leaks and over-pressurization, downed power lines, damage to our infrastructure by third parties, outages, environmental spills, mechanical problems and other incidents, which could cause substantial financial losses, as demonstrated in part by the Greater Lawrence Incident. In addition, these hazards and risks have resulted and may in the future result in serious injury or loss of life to employees and/or the general public, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm, which in turn could lead to substantial losses for us. The location of pipeline facilities, or generation, transmission, substation and distribution facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from such incidents. As with the Greater Lawrence Incident, certain incidents have subjected and may in the future subject us to litigation or administrative or other legal proceedings from time to time, both civil and criminal, which could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties against us, be resolved on unfavorable terms, and require us to incur significant operational expenses. The occurrence of incidents has in certain instances adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our reputation, cash flows, financial position and/or results of operations. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses.

We may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or at all.  Our liability insurance coverage did not provide protection against all significant losses as a result of the Greater Lawrence Incident and may not provide protection against all significant losses in the future.

Our ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost and coverage of such insurance, are affected by developments affecting our business; international, national, state, or local events; and the financial condition of insurers. The insurance market is experiencing a hardening environment due to reductions in commercial suppliers and the capacity they are willing to issue, increases in overall demand for capacity, and a prevalence of severe losses.  NiSource has been particularly affected by the current market conditions.  We have not been able to obtain liability insurance coverage at previously procured limits at rates that are acceptable to us.  Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at limits, rates or terms acceptable to us.  The premiums we pay for our insurance coverage have significantly increased as a result of market conditions and the accumulated loss ratio over the history of NiSource operations, and we expect that they will continue to increase as a result of market conditions. In addition, our insurance is not sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we are subject. For example, total expenses related to the Greater Lawrence Incident have exceeded the total amount of liability coverage available under our policies.

.

Also, certain types of damages, expenses or claimed costs, such as fines and penalties, may be excluded under the policies. In addition, insurers providing insurance to us may raise defenses to coverage under the terms and conditions of the respective insurance policies that could result in a denial of coverage or limit the amount of insurance proceeds available to us.  Any losses for which we are not fully insured or that are not covered by insurance at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.  For example, expenses related to the Greater Lawrence Incident that we are unable to recover from liability or property insurance have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our results of operations. For more information regarding our insurance programs in the context of the Greater Lawrence Incident, see Note


, "Other Commitments and Contingencies - C. Legal Proceedings," and " - E. Other Matters" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation related to our business operations, including those related to the Greater Lawrence Incident, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

We are

involved in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation in connection with our business operations, including the Greater Lawrence Incident, the most significant of which are summarized in Note


, “Other Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our insurance does not cover all costs and expenses that we have incurred and that we may incur in the future relating to the Greater Lawrence Incident, and may not fully cover other incidents that may occur in the future. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the outcomes of such matters, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Certain matters in connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident have had or may have a material impact as described in Note 19, "Other Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If one or more of such additional or other matters were decided against us, the effects could be material to our results of operations in the period in which we would be required to record or adjust the related liability and could also be material to our cash flows in the periods that we would be required to pay such liability.

We are exposed to significant reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to a loss of cost recovery, increased litigation and negative public perception.

As a utility company, we are subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of our services, the speed with which we are able to respond effectively to electric outages, natural gas leaks or events and related accidents and similar interruptions caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events, as well as our own or third parties' actions or failure to act.  We are also subject to adverse publicity related to actual or perceived environmental impacts. If customers, legislators, or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of us, this could result in less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight, increased litigation and negative public perception. The adverse publicity and investigations we experienced as a result of the Greater Lawrence Incident may have an ongoing negative impact on the public’s perception of us.  It is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of this adverse publicity. The foregoing may have continuing adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.

Our businesses are subject to various laws, regulations and tariffs. We could be materially adversely affected if we fail to comply with such laws, regulations and tariffs or with any changes in or new interpretations of such laws, regulations and tariffs.

Our businesses are subject to various laws, regulations and tariffs, including, but not limited to, those relating to natural gas pipeline safety, employee safety, the environment and our energy infrastructure. Existing laws, regulations and tariffs may be revised or become subject to new interpretations, and new laws, regulations and tariffs may be adopted or become applicable to us and our operations. In some cases, compliance with new laws, regulations and tariffs increases our costs.  If we fail to comply with laws, regulations and tariffs applicable to us or with any changes in or new interpretations of such laws, regulations or tariffs, our financial condition, results of operations, regulatory outcomes and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.

Our businesses are regulated under numerous environmental laws.  The cost of compliance with these laws, and changes to or additions to, or reinterpretations of the laws, could be significant.  Liability from the failure to comply with existing or changed laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Our businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and rules that regulate, among other things, air emissions, water usage and discharges, GHG and waste products such as coal combustion residuals. Compliance with these legal obligations require us to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment, remediation, environmental monitoring, emissions fees, and permits at many of our facilities. These expenditures are significant, and we expect that they will continue to

be significant in the future. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or are found to have caused damage to the environment or persons, that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against us and injunctions to remedy the failure or harm.

Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to change environmental regulation of the energy industry may be adopted or become applicable to us, with an increased focus on both coal and natural gas in recent years.  Revised or additional laws and regulations may result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on our facilities or increased compliance costs, which may not be fully recoverable from customers through regulated rates and could, therefore, impact our financial position, financial results and cash flow. Moreover, such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of our facilities.

An area of significant uncertainty and risk are the laws concerning emission of GHG. While we continue to reduce GHG emissions through the retirement of coal-fired electric generation, priority pipeline replacement, energy efficiency, leak detection and repair, and other programs, and expect to further reduce GHG emissions through increased use of renewable energy, GHG emissions are currently an expected aspect of the electric and natural gas business. Revised or additional future GHG legislation and/or regulation related to the generation of electricity or the extraction, production, distribution, transmission, storage and end use of natural gas could materially impact our gas supply, financial position, financial results and cash flows.

Even in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known or anticipated, the original cost estimates for environmental improvements, remediation of past environmental impact, or pollution reduction strategies and equipment can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended. The actual future expenditures depend on many factors, including the nature and extent of impact, the method of improvement, the cost of raw materials, contractor costs, and requirements established by environmental authorities.  Changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect our financial position, financial results and cash flows.

A significant portion of the gas and electricity we sell is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning. Accordingly, fluctuations in weather, gas and electricity commodity costs and economic conditions impact demand of our customers and our operating results.

Energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather. Forecasts of energy sales are based on “normal” weather, which represents a long-term historical average. Significant variations from normal weather could have, and have had, a material impact on energy sales. Additionally, residential usage, and to some degree commercial usage, is sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity, whereby usage declines with increased costs, thus affecting our financial results. Lastly, residential and commercial customers’ usage is sensitive to economic conditions and factors such as unemployment, consumption and consumer confidence.  Therefore, prevailing economic conditions affecting the demand of our customers may in turn affect our financial results.

Our business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries.

Business operations throughout our service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where it operates. In particular, sales to large industrial customers, such as those in the steel, oil refining, industrial gas and related industries, may be impacted by economic downturns and geographic or technological shifts in production or production methods. The U.S. manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increasing costs, and fluctuating demand for its products.

The implementation of NIPSCO’s electric generation strategy, including the retirement of its coal generation units, may not achieve intended results.

On October 31, 2018, NIPSCO submitted its 2018 Integrated Resource Plan with the IURC setting forth its short- and long-term electric generation plans in an effort to maintain affordability while providing reliable, flexible and cleaner sources of power.  The plan evaluated demand-side and supply-side resource alternatives to reliably and cost-effectively meet NIPSCO customers' future energy requirements over the ensuing 20 years. The preferred option within the Integrated Resource Plan sets forth a schedule to retire R.M. Schahfer Generating Station (Units 14, 15, 17, and 18) in 2023 and Michigan City Generating Station (Unit 12) in 2028. The current replacement plan includes renewable sources of energy, including wind, solar, and battery storage.

As part of this plan, NIPSCO has IURC approval for the Jordan Creek PPA for 400 MW, the Indiana Crossroads BTA for 300 MW and the Rosewater BTA for 100 MW. Each is a separate facility and all MW are nameplate capacity. NIPSCO has filed a notice with the IURC of its intention not to move forward with one of its approved PPAs due to the failure to meet a condition precedent in the agreement as a result of local zoning restrictions.

There are inherent risks and uncertainties in executing the Integrated Resource Plan, including changes in market conditions, regulatory approvals, environmental regulations, commodity costs and customer expectations, which may impede NIPSCO’s ability to achieve the intended results.  NIPSCO’s future success will depend, in part, on its ability to successfully implement its long-term electric generation plans, to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards, and to recover all, or a significant portion of, any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets. NIPSCO’s electric generation strategy could require significant future capital expenditures, operating costs and charges to earnings that may negatively impact our financial position, financial results and cash flows.

Fluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs or an inability to obtain an adequate, reliable and cost-effective fuel supply to meet customer demands may have a negative impact on our financial results.

Our electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel, and our gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas we deliver to our customers. These energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs. From time to time, we have also used hedging in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices. We rely on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the commodity costs incurred in providing service. However, while we have historically been successful in the recovery of costs related to such commodity prices, there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner.

In addition, we depend on electric transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to wholesale markets, supply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities, and provide retail energy services to customers. If transportation is disrupted, or if capacity is inadequate, we may be unable to sell and deliver our gas and electric

services to some or all of our customers. As a result, we may be required to procure additional or alternative electricity and/or natural gas supplies at then-current market rates, which, if recovery of related costs is disallowed, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.

We are exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services, and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements.

Our extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy, involves considerable judgment by our employees and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition, credit history and other factors. We monitor our credit risk exposure

by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers, and by evaluating the financial status of our banking partners and other counterparties by reference to market-based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and to traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. Adverse economic conditions could result in an increase in defaults by customers, suppliers and counterparties.

We have significant goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets. Impairments of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets related to Columbia of Massachusetts have resulted in significant charges to earnings for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2019. Any future impairments of other goodwill could result in a significant charge to earnings in a future period and negatively impact our compliance with certain covenants under financing agreements.

In accordance with GAAP, we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and review our definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate its fair value might be below its carrying value. Goodwill is also tested for impairment when factors, examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates, a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value, indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

We are required to record a charge in our financial statements for a period in which any impairment of our goodwill or definite-lived intangible assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, we conducted an impairment analysis for the goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets (franchise rights) related to Columbia of Massachusetts and concluded that such goodwill and franchise rights were impaired.  As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $204.8 million for such goodwill and an impairment charge of $209.7 million for such franchise rights at

December 31, 2019

. For additional information, see Note


, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

A significant charge in the future could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements. We are subject to a financial covenant under our revolving credit facility and term loan agreement, which require us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of

Changes in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes as well as challenges to tax positions could adversely affect our financial results.

We are subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal, state and local levels where we do business. Legislation or regulation which could affect our tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities. For example, the TCJA includes numerous provisions that affect businesses, including changes to U.S. corporate tax rates, business-related exclusions, and deductions and credits. The outcome of regulatory proceedings regarding the extent to which the effect of a change in corporate tax rate will impact customers and the time period over which the impact will occur could significantly impact future earnings and cash flows. Separately, a challenge by a taxing authority, changes in taxing authorities’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions, our ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits, or a deviation from other tax-related assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates.

Changes in accounting principles may adversely affect our financial results.

Future changes in accounting rules and associated changes in regulatory accounting may negatively impact the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Aging infrastructure may lead to disruptions in operations and increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.

We have risks associated with aging infrastructure, including our gas infrastructure assets. These risks can be driven by threats such as, but not limited to, internal corrosion, external corrosion and stress corrosion cracking. The age of these assets may result in a need for replacement, a higher level of maintenance costs, or unscheduled outages, despite efforts by us to properly maintain or upgrade these assets through inspection, scheduled maintenance and capital investment. In addition, the nature of the information available on aging infrastructure assets, which in some cases is incomplete, may make inspections, maintenance, upgrading and replacement of the assets particularly challenging. Additionally, missing or incorrect infrastructure data may lead to (1) difficulty properly locating facilities, which can result in excavator damage and operational or emergency response issues, and (2) configuration and control risks associated with the modification of system operating pressures in connection with turning off or turning on service to customers, which can result in unintended outages or operating pressures.  Also, additional maintenance and inspections are required in some instances in order to improve infrastructure information and records and address emerging regulatory or risk management requirements, which increases our costs. The failure to operate these assets as desired could result in gas leaks and other incidents and in our inability to meet firm service obligations, which could adversely impact revenues, and could also result in increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs, which, if not fully recovered from customers, could negatively impact our financial results.

The impacts of climate change, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, accidents or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers.

A disruption or failure of natural gas distribution systems, or within electric generation, transmission or distribution systems, in the event of a major hurricane, tornado, terrorist attack, cyber-attack (as further detailed below), accident or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. We have experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature. The occurrence of such events could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.  In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. There is also a concern that climate change may exacerbate the risks to physical infrastructure.  Such risks include heat stresses to power lines, storms that damage infrastructure, lake and sea level changes that affect the manner in which services are currently provided, droughts or other stresses on water used to supply services, and other extreme weather conditions. Climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect our business in many ways, including increasing the costs we incur in providing our products and services, impacting the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and affecting the economic health of the regions in which we operate.

A cyber-attack on any of our or certain third-party computer systems upon which we rely may adversely affect our ability to operate and could lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information or potential liability.

We are reliant on technology to run our business, which is dependent upon financial and operational computer systems to process critical information necessary to conduct various elements of our business, including the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, operation of our gas pipeline facilities and the recording and reporting of commercial and financial transactions to regulators, investors and other stakeholders.  In addition to general information and cyber risks that all large corporations face (e.g., malware, unauthorized access attempts, phishing attacks, malicious intent by insiders and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information), the utility industry faces evolving and increasingly complex cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer information, electric grid infrastructure, and natural gas infrastructure. Deployment of new business technologies represents a new and large-scale opportunity for attacks on our information systems and confidential customer information, as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and the natural gas infrastructure. Increasing large-scale corporate attacks in conjunction with more sophisticated threats continue to challenge power and utility companies. Any failure of our computer systems, or those of our customers, suppliers or others with whom we do business, could materially disrupt our ability to operate our business and could result in a financial loss and possibly do harm to our reputation.

Additionally, our information systems experience ongoing, often sophisticated, cyber-attacks by a variety of sources, including foreign sources, with the apparent aim to breach our cyber-defenses. Although we attempt to maintain adequate defenses to these attacks and work through industry groups and trade associations to identify common threats and assess our countermeasures, a security breach of our information systems, or a security breach of the information systems of our customers, suppliers or others with whom we do business, could (i) impact the reliability of our generation, transmission and distribution systems and potentially negatively impact our compliance with certain mandatory reliability standards, (ii) subject us to reputational and other harm or liabilities associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information such as system operating information or information, personal or otherwise, relating to our customers or employees, (iii) impact our ability to manage our businesses, and/or (iv) subject us to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims from third parties, in addition to remediation costs, any of which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects. Although we do maintain cyber insurance, it is possible that such insurance will not adequately cover any losses or liabilities we may incur as a result of any cybersecurity-related litigation.

Our capital projects and programs subject us to construction risks and natural gas costs and supply risks, and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies.

Our business requires substantial capital expenditures for investments in, among other things, capital improvements to our electric generating facilities, electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure, natural gas storage, and other projects, including projects for environmental compliance. We are engaged in intrastate natural gas pipeline modernization programs to maintain system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility.  NIPSCO also is currently engaged in a number of capital projects, including environmental improvements to its electric generating stations, the construction of new transmission facilities, and new projects related to renewable energy.  As we undertake these projects and programs, we may be unable to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs. Additionally, we may construct or purchase some of these projects and programs to capture anticipated future growth in natural gas production, which may not materialize, and may cause the construction to occur over an extended period of time.

Our existing and planned capital projects require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from federal, state, and local governmental agencies. If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities, we may be forced to incur additional costs, or we may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in a project. We also may not receive the anticipated increases in revenue and cash flows resulting from such projects and programs until after their completion. Other construction risks include changes in costs of materials, equipment, commodities or labor (including changes to tariffs on materials), delays caused by construction incidents or injuries, work stoppages, shortages in qualified labor, poor initial cost estimates, unforeseen engineering issues, the ability to obtain necessary rights-of-way, easements and transmissions connections and general contractors and subcontractors not performing as required under their contracts.

To the extent that delays occur, costs become unrecoverable, or we otherwise become unable to effectively manage and complete our capital projects, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected.

Sustained extreme weather conditions may negatively impact our operations.

We conduct our operations across a wide geographic area subject to varied and potentially extreme weather conditions, which may from time to time persist for sustained periods of time. Despite preventative maintenance efforts, persistent weather related stress

on our infrastructure may reveal weaknesses in our systems not previously known to us or otherwise present various operational challenges across all business segments. Further, adverse weather may affect our ability to conduct operations in a manner that satisfies customer expectations or contractual obligations, including by causing service disruptions.

Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, and maintain good labor relations, could harm our results of operations.

We operate in an industry that requires many of our employees to possess unique technical skill sets.  Events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, the mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges or increased costs. These operating challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development.  In addition, current and prospective employees may determine that they do not wish to work for us due to market, economic, employment and other conditions.  Failure to hire and retain qualified employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business.  If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, safety, service reliability, customer satisfaction and our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Some of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on an operating company basis.  Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows.

We are a holding company and are dependent on cash generated by our subsidiaries to meet our debt obligations and pay dividends on our stock.

We are a holding company and conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiaries, which are separate and distinct legal entities. Substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to meet our debt obligations or pay dividends on our common stock and preferred stock is largely dependent upon cash generated by these subsidiaries. In the event a major subsidiary is not able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to us, our ability to service our debt obligations or pay dividends could be negatively affected.

If we cannot effectively manage new initiatives and organizational changes, we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the business and regulatory environment.

In order to execute on our sustainable growth strategy and enhance our culture of ongoing continuous improvement, we must effectively manage the complexity and frequency of new initiatives and organizational changes.  If we are unable to make decisions quickly, assess our opportunities and risks, and implement new governance, managerial and organizational processes as needed to execute our strategy in this increasingly dynamic and competitive business and regulatory environment, our financial condition, results of operations and relationships with our business partners, regulators, customers and stockholders may be negatively impacted.

We outsource certain business functions to third-party suppliers and service providers, and substandard performance by those third parties could harm our business, reputation and results of operations.

Utilities rely on extensive networks of business partners and suppliers to support critical enterprise capabilities across their organizations. Global metrics indicate that deliveries from suppliers are slowing and that labor shortages are occurring in the energy sector. We outsource certain services to third parties in areas including construction services, information technology, materials, fleet, environmental, operational services and other areas. Outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to inferior service quality or substandard deliverables, which may result in non-compliance (including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards), interruption of service or accidents, or reputational harm, which could negatively impact our results of operations. If any difficulties in the operations of these third-party suppliers and service providers, including their systems, were to occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations, or adversely affect our ability to work with regulators, unions, customers or employees.

Changes in the method for determining LIBOR and the potential replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Some of our indebtedness, including borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement, bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR. From time to time, we also enter into hedging instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the LIBOR benchmark interest rate. In addition, these hedging instruments, as well as hedging instruments that our subsidiaries

use for hedging natural gas price and basis risk, rely on LIBOR-based rates to calculate interest accrued on certain payments that may be required to be made under these agreements, such as late payments or interest accrued if any cash collateral should be held by a counterparty. Any changes announced by regulators in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in the reported LIBOR rates. If that were to occur, the level of interest payments we incur may change.

In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") as its recommended alternative to LIBOR, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018. SOFR is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight that is collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities.  However, because SOFR is a broad U.S. Treasury repurchase agreement financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions, it differs fundamentally from LIBOR. For example, SOFR is a secured overnight rate, while LIBOR is an unsecured rate that represents interbank funding over different maturities. In addition, because SOFR is a transaction-based rate, it is backward-looking, whereas LIBOR is forward-looking. Because of these and other differences, there is no assurance that SOFR will perform in the same way as LIBOR would have performed at any time, and there is no guarantee that it is a comparable substitute for LIBOR. SOFR may fail to gain market acceptance.

In addition, although certain of our LIBOR based obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on certain of our obligations if LIBOR is not reported, which include, without limitation, requesting certain rates from major reference banks in London or New York, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with, the interest rates or payments that would have been made on our obligations if a LIBOR-based rate was available in its current form.

Corporate and Other Operations

We own the Southlake Complex, our 325,000 square foot headquarters building located in Merrillville, Indiana.

Character of Ownership

Our principal properties and our subsidiaries principal properties are owned free from encumbrances, subject to minor exceptions, none of which are of such a nature as to impair substantially the usefulness of such properties. Many of our subsidiary offices in various communities served are occupied under leases. All properties are subject to routine liens for taxes, assessments and undetermined charges (if any) incidental to construction. It is our practice to regularly pay such amounts, as and when due, unless contested in good faith. In general, the electric lines, gas pipelines and related facilities are located on land not owned by us or our subsidiaries, but are covered by necessary consents of various governmental authorities or by appropriate rights obtained from owners of private property. We do not, however, generally have specific easements from the owners of the property adjacent to public highways over, upon or under which our electric lines and gas distribution pipelines are located. At the time each of the principal properties were purchased, a title search was made. In general, no examination of titles as to rights-of-way for electric lines, gas pipelines or related facilities was made, other than examination, in certain cases, to verify the grantors’ ownership and the lien status thereof.

NiSource’s common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “NI.”

Holders of shares of NiSource’s common stock are entitled to receive dividends if and when declared by NiSource’s Board out of funds legally available, subject to the prior dividend rights of holders of our preferred stock or the depositary shares representing such preferred stock outstanding, and if full dividends have not been declared and paid on all outstanding shares of preferred stock in any dividend period, no dividend may be declared or paid or set aside for payment on our common stock. The policy of the Board has been to declare cash dividends on a quarterly basis payable on or about the 20th day of February, May, August, and November.  At its

January 31, 2020

meeting, the Board declared a quarterly common dividend of

$0.21

per share, payable on

February 20, 2020

to holders of record on

February 11, 2020

.

Although the Board currently intends to continue the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on common shares, the timing and amount of future dividends will depend on the earnings of NiSource’s subsidiaries, their financial condition, cash requirements, regulatory restrictions, any restrictions in financing agreements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. There can be no assurance that NiSource will continue to pay such dividends or the amount of such dividends.

As of

February 18, 2020

, NiSource had 18,868 common stockholders of record and

382,263,348

shares outstanding.

The graph below compares the cumulative total shareholder return of NiSource’s common stock for the last five years with the cumulative total return for the same period of the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Utility indices.  On July 1, 2015, NiSource completed the Separation.  Following the Separation, NiSource retained no ownership interest in CPG.  The Separation is treated as a special dividend for purposes of calculating the total shareholder return, with the then-current market value of the distributed shares being deemed to have been reinvested on the Separation date in shares of NiSource common stock.  A vertical line is included on the graph below to identify the periods before and after the Separation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Management’s Discussion) analyzes our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and those of our subsidiaries. It also includes management’s analysis of past financial results and certain potential factors that may affect future results, potential future risks and approaches that may be used to manage those risks. See "Note regarding forward-looking statements" at the beginning of this report for a list of factors that may cause results to differ materially.

Management’s Discussion is designed to provide an understanding of our operations and financial performance and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report.

We are an energy holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 whose subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving customers in seven states. We generate substantially all of our operating income through these rate-regulated businesses which are summarized for financial reporting purposes into two primary reportable segments: Gas Distribution Operations and Electric Operations.

Refer to the “Business” section under Item 1 of this annual report and Note


, "Segments of Business," in the Notes to  Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our regulated utility business segments.

Our goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as we address changing customer conservation patterns, develops more contemporary pricing structures and embarks on long-term infrastructure investment and safety programs. These strategies are intended to improve reliability and safety, enhance customer services and reduce emissions while generating sustainable returns. Additionally, we continue to pursue regulatory and legislative initiatives that will allow residential customers not currently on our system to obtain gas service in a cost effective manner. Refer also to the discussion of

Electric Supply

Greater Lawrence Incident:

The Greater Lawrence Incident occurred on September 13, 2018. The following table summarizes expenses incurred and insurance recoveries recorded since the Greater Lawrence Incident. The amounts set forth in the table below do not include the capital cost of the pipeline replacement described below and as set forth in Note


, "Other Commitments and Contingencies - E. Other Matters - Greater Lawrence Pipeline Replacement," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inclusive of the

$1,041 million

with government investigations as set forth in Note


, "Other Commitments and Contingencies - C. Legal Proceedings," will range from

$1,041 million

to

$1,065 million

, depending on the number, nature, final outcome and value of third-party claims and the final outcome of government investigations. These costs do not include costs of certain third-party claims and fines, penalties or settlements with government investigations that we are not able to estimate. We expect to incur a total of

$450 million

to

$460 million

in other incident-related costs, inclusive of the

$420 million

recorded incident to date, as set forth in Note


, "Other Commitments and Contingencies - E. Other Matters - Greater Lawrence Incident Restoration."

The process for estimating costs associated with third-party claims and fines, penalties and settlements associated with government investigations relating to the Greater Lawrence Incident requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors. As more information becomes known, including additional information regarding ongoing investigations, management’s estimates and assumptions regarding the financial impact of the Greater Lawrence Incident may change.

The aggregate amount of third-party liability insurance coverage available for losses arising from the Greater Lawrence Incident is

$800 million

.  We have collected the entire $800 million as of December 31, 2019. Expenses related to the incident have exceeded the total amount of insurance coverage available under our policies. The following table presents activity related to our Greater Lawrence Incident insurance recovery.

(1)

$5 million

of insurance recoveries were collected during 2018.

Since the Greater Lawrence Incident and through

December 31, 2019

, we have invested approximately

$258 million

of capital spend for the pipeline replacement; this work was completed in 2019. We maintain property insurance for gas pipelines and other applicable property. Columbia of Massachusetts has filed a proof of loss with its property insurer for the full cost of the pipeline replacement. In January 2020, we filed a lawsuit against the property insurer, seeking payment of our property claim. We are currently unable to predict the timing or amount of any insurance recovery under the property policy. The recovery of any capital investment not reimbursed through insurance will be addressed in a future regulatory proceeding; a future regulatory proceeding is dependent on the outcome of the sale of the Massachusetts Business. The outcome of such a proceeding (if any) is uncertain. In accordance with ASC 980-360, if it becomes probable that a portion of the pipeline replacement cost will not be recoverable through customer rates and an amount can be reasonably estimated, we will reduce our regulated plant balance for the amount of the probable disallowance and record an associated charge to earnings. This could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, if a rate order is received allowing recovery of the investment with no or reduced return on investment, a loss on disallowance may be required.

Refer to Note


, "Other Commitments and Contingencies - C. Legal Proceedings" and " - E. Other Matters," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, "Summary of Consolidated Financial Results," "Results and Discussion of Segment Operation - Gas Distribution Operations," and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this Management's Discussion for additional information related to the Greater Lawrence Incident.

Additionally, as discussed in Note


, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we assessed the totality of several factors that developed during the fourth quarter related to the Greater Lawrence Incident and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit was below its carrying value. As a result, a new impairment analysis was required for our Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit. The year-end impairment analysis indicated that the fair value of the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit was below its carrying value. As a result, we reduced the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit goodwill balance to zero and recognized a goodwill impairment charge totaling

$204.8 million

, which is non-deductible for tax purposes.  We assessed the same fourth quarter circumstances in reviewing the Columbia of Massachusetts franchise rights intangible assets.  These factors led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the franchise rights was below its carrying amount.  As a result, we performed a year-end impairment test and determined that the fair value of the franchise rights was zero.  Therefore, we wrote off the entire franchise rights book value, which resulted in an impairment charge totaling

$209.7 million

.

Columbia of Massachusetts Asset Sale:

On February 26, 2020, NiSource and Columbia of Massachusetts entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement with Eversource. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement, NiSource and Columbia of Massachusetts agreed to sell to Eversource the Massachusetts Business for a purchase price of $1,100 million, subject to adjustment. For additional information, see Note 26, “Subsequent Event,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Summary of Consolidated Financial Results

Our operations are affected by the cost of sales. Cost of sales for the Gas Distribution Operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of natural gas used while providing transportation and distribution services to customers. Cost of sales for the Electric Operations segment is comprised of the cost of coal, related handling costs, natural gas purchased for the internal generation of electricity at NIPSCO and the cost of power purchased from third-party generators of electricity.

The majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in operating revenues. As a result, we believe net revenues, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as operating revenues less cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization), provides management and investors a useful measure to analyze profitability. The presentation of net revenues herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding operating performance. Net revenues do not intend to represent operating income, the most comparable GAAP measure, as an indicator of operating performance and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

For the years ended

and


, operating income and a reconciliation of net revenues to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating income, was as follows:

On a consolidated basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of

$328.0 million

or

$0.88

per basic share for the twelve months ended

December 31, 2019

compared to a loss to common shareholders of

$65.6 million

or

$0.18

per basic share for the same period in


. The increase in net income available to common shareholders during 2019 was primarily due to lower operating expenses related to the Greater Lawrence Incident, insurance recoveries recorded related to the Greater Lawrence Incident, and new rates from base rate proceedings and infrastructure replacement programs. These increases were partially offset by non-cash impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in 2019 related to Columbia of Massachusetts (see Note 6, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), higher income taxes (see "Income Taxes" below), higher depreciation expense due to regulatory outcomes at NIPSCO and Columbia of Ohio, and additional dilution in 2019 resulting from preferred stock dividend commitments.

Operating Income

For the twelve months ended

December 31, 2019

, we reported operating income of

$890.7 million

compared to

$124.7 million

for the same period in


. The increased operating income was primarily due to decreased operating expenses related to the Greater Lawrence Incident, insurance recoveries recorded related to the Greater Lawrence Incident, and new rates from base rate proceedings and infrastructure replacement programs. These increases were partially offset by non-cash impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in 2019 related to Columbia of Massachusetts (see Note


, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), and increased depreciation due to the regulatory outcome of NIPSCO's gas rate case and an increase in amortization of depreciation previously deferred as a regulatory asset resulting from Columbia of Ohio's CEP.

Other Deductions, Net

Other deductions, net reduced income by

$384.1 million

in


compared to a reduction in income of

$355.3 million

in


. This change is primarily due to lower actuarial investment returns on pension and other postretirement benefit assets of $34.6 million, and an increase in interest expense of $25.6 million driven by decreased regulatory deferrals from Columbia of Ohio's CEP. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by charitable contributions of $20.7 million in 2018 related to the Greater Lawrence Incident.

Income Taxes

The increase in income tax expense from 2018 to 2019 is primarily attributable to higher pre-tax income resulting from the items discussed above in "Operating Income" and "Other Deductions, Net," true-ups to tax expense in 2018 to reflect regulatory outcomes associated with excess deferred income taxes, and higher income tax expense in 2019 related to the non-deductible, non-cash impairment of goodwill, fines and penalties.

Capital Investment

In

$1.9 billion

in capital expenditures across the gas and electric utilities. These expenditures were primarily aimed at furthering the safety and reliability of our gas distribution system, and maintaining our existing electric generation fleet.

We continue to execute on an estimated $30 billion in total projected long-term regulated utility infrastructure investments and expect to invest approximately

Liquidity

A primary focus of ours is to ensure the availability of adequate financing to fund our ongoing safety and infrastructure investment programs which typically involves the issuance of debt and/or equity. In addition, expenses related to the Greater Lawrence Incident have exceeded the total amount of insurance coverage available under our policies. During 2020, we plan to pursue alternatives to cover this shortfall, including long-term financing and potential proceeds from the sale of the Massachusetts Business. For additional information, see Note


, "Subsequent Event," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under our short-term revolving credit facility, commercial paper program, accounts receivable securitization facilities, term loan borrowings, long-term debt agreements, our ability to access the capital markets and the potential sale of the Massachusetts Business, we believe there is adequate capital available to fund our operating activities and capital expenditures and the effects of the Greater Lawrence Incident in

Comparability of line item operating results may be impacted by regulatory, tax and depreciation trackers (other than those for cost of sales) that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs.

Lower employee and administrative expenses of $30.2 million driven by reduced incentive compensation and a temporary shift of resources to the Greater Lawrence Incident restoration.

Weather

In general, we calculate the weather-related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Our composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather-related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution Operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather-related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in our aggregated composite heating degree day comparison.

The definition of “normal” weather was updated during the first quarter of 2019 to reflect more current weather pattern data and to more closely align with the regulators' jurisdictional definitions of “normal” weather. Impacts of the change in methodology will be reflected prospectively and disclosed to the extent it results in notable year-over-year variances in net revenues.

Economic Conditions

All of our Gas Distribution Operations companies have state-approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs.  Gas costs are treated as pass-through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under-recovered or over-recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings.

BP Products North America.

On March 29, 2018, WCE, which is currently owned by BP p.l.c ("BP") and BP Products North America, which operates the BP Refinery, filed a petition at the IURC asking that the combined operations of WCE and BP be treated as a single premise, and the WCE generation be dedicated primarily to BP Refinery operations beginning in May 2019 as WCE has self-certified as a qualifying facility at FERC. BP Refinery planned to continue to purchase electric service from NIPSCO at a reduced demand level beginning May 2019; however, a settlement agreement was filed on November 2, 2018 agreeing that BP and WCE would not move forward with construction of a private transmission line to serve BP until conclusion of NIPSCO's pending electric rate case. The IURC approved the settlement agreement as filed on February 20, 2019.  On December 4, 2019, the IURC issued an order in the electric rate case approving the implementation of a new industrial service structure.  This resolved the issues included in BP’s original petition. Refer to Note


, "Regulatory Matters," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Economic Conditions

NIPSCO has a state-approved recovery mechanism that provides a means for full recovery of prudently incurred fuel costs.

NIPSCO 2018 Integrated Resource Plan.

Multiple factors, but primarily economic ones, including low natural gas prices, advancing cost effective renewable technology and increasing capital and operating costs associated with existing coal plants, have led NIPSCO to conclude in its October 2018 Integrated Resource Plan submission that NIPSCO’s current fleet of coal generation facilities will be retired earlier than previous Integrated Resource Plan’s had indicated.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Greater Lawrence Incident:

As discussed in the "Executive Summary" and in Note


, “Other Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have recorded and paid costs associated with the Greater Lawrence Incident and have invested capital to replace the entire affected 45-mile cast iron and bare steel pipeline system that delivers gas to the impacted area. As discussed in the "Executive Summary," Note


referenced earlier in this paragraph, and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” we may incur additional expenses and liabilities in excess of our recorded liabilities and estimated additional costs associated with the Greater Lawrence Incident. Since the Greater Lawrence Incident and through

December 31, 2019

, we have collected $800 million from insurance providers; however, total costs related to the incident have exceeded the total amount of insurance coverage available under our policies. To date, this excess has primarily been funded through short-term borrowings. During 2020, we plan to pursue alternatives to these short-term borrowings, which include long-term financing and potential proceeds from the sale of the Massachusetts Business. For additional information, see Note 26, “Subsequent Event,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operating Activities

Net cash from operating activities for the year ended

December 31, 2019

was

$1,583.3 million

,

an increase

of

$1,043.2 million

from


.  This increase was driven primarily by the receipt of $795 million of insurance recoveries in 2019 related to the Greater Lawrence Incident and approximately $220 million lower cash spend for the Greater Lawrence Incident in 2019. Refer to Note


, "Other Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Greater Lawrence Incident.

Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding

. In 2019, we contributed

$2.9 million

to our pension plans and

$23.0 million

to our other postretirement benefit plans. In  2018, we contributed

$2.9 million

to our pension plans and

$21.0 million

to our other postretirement benefit plans. Given the current funded status of the pension plans, and barring unforeseen  market volatility that may negatively impact the valuation of our plan assets, we do not believe additional material contributions to our pension plans will be required for the foreseeable future.

Income Taxes.

Rates for our regulated customers include provisions for the collection of U.S. federal income taxes. The reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the TCJA led to a decrease in the amount billed to customers through rates, ultimately resulting in lower cash collections from operating activities.  In addition, we are required to pass back to customers “excess deferred taxes” which represent amounts collected from customers in the past to cover deferred tax liabilities which, as a result of the passage of the TCJA, are now less than the originally billed amounts. Approximately $1.5 billion of excess deferred taxes was recorded as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2017 as a result of implementing the TCJA. The majority of this balance related to temporary book-to-tax differences on utility property protected by IRS normalization rules; this portion of the excess deferred taxes balance will be passed back to customers over the remaining average useful life of the associated property as required by the TCJA. The remainder of the excess deferred tax balance is passed back over periods determined by our state utility commissions. The pass back of excess deferred taxes has been approved in all our jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2019, we have approximately $1.3 billion of remaining regulatory liabilities associated with excess deferred taxes.

As of

December 31, 2019

, we have a deferred tax asset of

$657.1 million

related to a federal NOL carryforward, of which

$406.1 million

relates to years prior to the implementation of the TCJA. As a result of being in an NOL position, we were not required to make any cash payments for federal income tax purposes during the three years ended

December 31, 2019

. The carryforward periods for pre-TCJA tax benefits expire in various tax years from


to


; however, we expect to fully utilize the carryforward benefit prior to its expiration. According to the TCJA, utilization of NOL carryforwards generated after December 31, 2017 do not expire but are limited to 80% of current year taxable income. Accordingly, we may be required to make cash payments for federal income taxes in future years despite having NOL carryforwards in excess of current taxes payable.

Amounts differ from those presented on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows primarily due to the capitalized portion of the Corporate Incentive Plan payout, inclusion of capital expenditures included in current liabilities and AFUDC Equity.

(3)

The 2018 capital expenditures for Gas Distribution Operations reflects reclassifying the Greater Lawrence Incident pipeline replacement from system growth and tracker to maintenance.

For


, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were

$1,867.8 million

, which was $53.2 million higher than the


capital program. This increased spending is primarily due to growth, safety and system modernization projects.

For


, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were

$1,814.6 million

, which was $60.8 million higher than the

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization.

Certain of our subsidiaries have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral if our credit ratings or the credit ratings of certain of our subsidiaries are below investment grade.  These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. As of

December 31, 2019

, the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately

$72.1 million

Market Risk Disclosures

Risk is an inherent part of our businesses. The extent to which we properly and effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our businesses is critical to our profitability. We seek to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal market risks that are involved in our businesses: commodity price risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management for us is a multi-faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. Our senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. These may include, but are not limited to market, operational, financial, compliance and strategic risk types. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, our risk management process, policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification.

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to commodity price risk as a result of our subsidiaries’ operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, our subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps, forwards and options. We do not participate in speculative energy trading activity.

Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at our rate-regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate-making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate-making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk.

Our subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, some of which is reflected in our restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets.

Refer to Note


, "Risk Management Activities," in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our commodity price risk assets and liabilities as of

December 31, 2019

and


.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program, term loan agreement and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short-term market interest rates.  Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short-term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by

$19.0 million

and

$13.3 million

for


and


, respectively. We are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in benchmark rates that can influence the interest rates of future debt issuances.

Credit Risk

Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of our business activities. Our extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the risk management function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative-related contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to us at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of credit.

We closely monitor the financial status of our banking credit providers. We evaluate the financial status of our banking partners through the use of market-based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies.

Other Information

Critical Accounting Policies

We apply certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on our operations and Consolidated Financial Statements.

Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.

ASC Topic 980,

Regulated Operations

, provides that rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were

$2,239.6 million

and

$2,512.2 million

at

December 31, 2019

, and

$2,237.5 million

and

$2,660.0 million

at

December 31, 2018

, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note


, “Regulatory Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for us to recover our costs in the future, all or a portion of our regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980,

Regulated Operations

. In such event, a write-down of all or a portion of our existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under GAAP for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If we were unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980,

Regulated Operations

, we would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980-20,

Discontinuation of Rate-Regulated Accounting

. In management’s opinion, our regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980,

Regulated Operations

for the foreseeable future.

Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, we believe that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to

$307.2 million

at

December 31, 2019

. If we determine that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts.

The passage of the TCJA into law in December 2017 necessitated the remeasurement of our deferred income tax balances to reflect the change in the statutory federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. For our regulated entities, substantially all of the impact of this remeasurement was recorded to a regulatory liability and is being passed backed to customers, as established during the rate making process. For additional information, refer to Note


, "Regulatory Matters," and Note


, "Income Taxes," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As discussed in Note 19-E, "Other Matters - Greater Lawrence Pipeline Replacement," since the Greater Lawrence Incident and through December 31, 2019, we have invested approximately $258 million of capital spend for the pipeline replacement in the affected communities; this work was completed in 2019. We maintain property insurance for gas pipelines and other applicable property. Columbia of Massachusetts has filed a proof of loss with its property insurer for the full cost of the pipeline replacement. In January 2020, we filed a lawsuit against the property insurer, seeking payment of our property claim. We are currently unable

to predict the timing or amount of any insurance recovery under the property policy. The recovery of any capital investment not reimbursed through insurance will be addressed in a future regulatory proceeding; a future regulatory proceeding is dependent on the outcome of the sale of the Massachusetts Business. The outcome of such a proceeding (if any) is uncertain. In accordance with ASC 980-360, if it becomes probable that a portion of the pipeline replacement cost will not be recoverable through customer rates and an amount can be reasonably estimated, we will reduce our regulated plant balance for the amount of the probable disallowance and record an associated charge to earnings. This could result in a material adverse effect to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, if a rate order is received allowing recovery of the investment with no or reduced return on investment, a loss on disallowance may be required.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits.

We have defined benefit plans for both pension and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, health care trend rates, and mortality rates, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long-term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred into AOCI or a regulatory balance sheet account, depending on the jurisdiction of our entity. These deferred gains or losses are then amortized into the income statement when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets (known in GAAP as the “corridor” method) or when settlement accounting is triggered.

The discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions. Methods used to develop these assumptions are described below. While a third party actuarial firm assists with the development of many of these assumptions, we are ultimately responsible for selecting the final assumptions.

The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. Our discount rates for both pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using spot rates along an AA-rated above median yield curve with cash flows matching the expected duration of benefit payments to be made to plan participants.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is a component utilized in calculating annual pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, target asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets.

For measurement of 2020 net periodic benefit cost, we selected an expected pre-tax long-term rate of return of 5.70% and 5.67% for our pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets, respectively.

We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate, which is used in determining our other postretirement benefit net expense, based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation, third-party actuarial surveys and general economic conditions.

We use the Society of Actuaries’ most recently published mortality data in developing a best estimate of mortality as part of the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.

The following tables illustrate the effects of changes in these actuarial assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant:

(1)

Before labor capitalization and regulatory deferrals.

In January 2017, we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. This change, compared to the previous method, resulted in a decrease in the actuarially-determined service and interest cost components. Historically, we estimated service and interest cost utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. For fiscal 2017 and beyond, we now utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. For further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note


, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

We have seven goodwill reporting units, comprised of the seven state operating companies within the Gas Distribution Operations reportable segment. Our goodwill assets at

December 31, 2019

were

$1,486 million

, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000.

As required by GAAP, we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. Our annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was performed on May 1, 2019. A qualitative ("step 0") test was completed on May 1, 2019 for all reporting units other than our Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit. In the Step 0 analysis, we assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the applicable reporting units as compared to their baseline May 1, 2016 “step 1” fair value measurement. The results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that these reporting units fair values are less than their reporting unit carrying values; therefore, no “step 1” analysis was required.

The results of our Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit were negatively impacted by the Greater Lawrence Incident (see Note


-C, "Legal Proceedings," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). As a result, we completed a quantitative "step 1" analysis for the May 1, 2019 goodwill analysis for this reporting unit. Consistent with our historical impairment testing of goodwill, fair value of this reporting unit was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches. These approaches require significant judgments including appropriate long-term growth rates and discount rates for the income approach and appropriate multiples of earnings for peer companies and control premiums for the market approach.  The discount rates were derived using peer company data compiled with the assistance of a third party valuation services firm. The discount rates used are subject to change based on changes in tax rates at both the state and federal level, debt and equity ratios at each reporting unit and general economic conditions.  The long-term growth rate was derived by evaluating historic growth rates, new business and investment opportunities beyond the near term horizon. The long-term growth rate is subject to change depending on inflationary impacts to

.

the U.S. economy and the individual business environments in which each reporting unit operates. The Step 1 analysis performed indicated that the fair value of the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. As a result, no impairment charge was recorded as of the May 1, 2019 test date.

Although our annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter, we continue to monitor changes in circumstances that may indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than the reporting unit carrying value. During the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the preparation of the year-end financial statements, we assessed matters related to Columbia of Massachusetts. While there was no single determinative event or factor, the consideration in totality of several factors that developed during the fourth quarter of 2019 led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit was below its carrying value. These factors included: (i) increased Massachusetts DPU regulatory enforcement activity related to Columbia of Massachusetts during the fourth quarter, including (a) an order imposing work restrictions on Columbia of Massachusetts, impacting Columbia of Massachusetts' infrastructure replacement program, (b) two orders opening public investigations into Columbia of Massachusetts related to the Greater Lawrence Incident and restoration efforts following the incident, and (c) an order defining the scope of the Massachusetts DPU's investigation into the preparation and response of Columbia of Massachusetts related to the incident; (ii) increased uncertainty as to the ability of Columbia of Massachusetts to execute its growth strategy, including utility infrastructure investments, and to obtain timely regulatory outcomes with reasonable rates of return; (iii) further damage to Columbia of Massachusetts' reputation as a result of concerns related to service lines abandoned during the restoration work following the Greater Lawrence Incident and the gas release event in Lawrence, Massachusetts on September 27, 2019; and (iv) a potential sale of the Massachusetts Business.  See Note


, "Other Commitments and Contingencies - C. Legal Proceedings," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding Massachusetts DPU regulatory enforcement activity and Note 26, "Subsequent Event," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the potential sale of the Massachusetts Business.

As a result, a new impairment analysis was required for our Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit. This analysis used a weighted average of income and market approaches for calculating fair value. The income approach calculated discounted cash flows using updated cash flow projections, discount rates and return on equity assumptions. The market approach applied a combination of comparable company multiples and comparable transactions and used updated cash flow projections. While certain assumptions, such as market multiples, remained unchanged in the year-end test, our cash flow projections, return on equity and rate case timing assumptions were all unfavorably updated at year-end compared to the May 1, 2019 test. The effects of these unfavorable developments were greater than the favorable change in weighted average cost of capital between the two tests. The year-end impairment analysis indicated that the fair value of the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit was below its carrying value. As a result, we reduced the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit goodwill balance to zero and recognized a goodwill impairment charge totaling

$204.8 million

, which is non-deductible for tax purposes.

Our intangible assets, apart from goodwill, consist of franchise rights. Franchise rights were identified as part of the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisition in February 1999 of Columbia of Massachusetts. We review our definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate its fair value might be below its carrying amount.

During the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the preparation of the year-end financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of the franchise rights was below its carrying amount. These factors were the same fourth quarter circumstances outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above. As a result, we performed a year-end impairment test in which we compared the book value of Columbia of Massachusetts to its undiscounted future cash flow and estimated fair value. With this analysis, we determined that the fair value of the franchise rights was zero. Therefore, we wrote off the entire franchise rights book value, which resulted in an impairment charge totaling

$209.7 million

. See Note


, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Revenue Recognition.

Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed.

We adopted the provisions of ASC 606 beginning on January 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective method, which was applied to all contracts. No material adjustments were made to January 1, 2018 opening balances and no material changes in the amount or timing of future revenue recognition occurred as a result of the adoption of ASC 606.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of NiSource Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NiSource Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related statements of consolidated income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 1, 8, 19, and 26 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

Certain subsidiaries of NiSource Inc. are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving customers in seven states. These rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the manner in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and it is probable that such rates can be charged to and collected from customers. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are later recognized in income as the related amounts are included in customer rates and recovered from or refunded to customers.

Through December 31, 2019, the Company invested approximately $258 million of capital spend for the Greater Lawrence Incident pipeline replacement. As of December 31, 2019, the Company determined that a disallowance of the Greater Lawrence Incident pipeline replacement capital expenditures was not probable. On February 26, 2020, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Columbia of Massachusetts (CMA), agreed to sell substantially all of CMA's utility property, plant, and equipment (including the

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Greater Lawrence Incident pipeline replacement assets) with other specified assets and liabilities, to a third party. The Company estimates that the total pre-tax loss resulting from this sale will be approximately $360 million, based on December 31, 2019 asset and liability balances and estimated transaction costs.

We identified the accounting for rate-regulated subsidiaries as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing (1) the likelihood of recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) the likelihood of refund of amounts previously collected from customers, and (3) the probability of recovery of amounts capitalized related to the Greater Lawrence Incident pipeline replacement. Given that management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by regulatory commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate making process due its inherent complexities.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by regulatory commissions included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment, including the Greater Lawrence Incident pipeline replacement; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments, that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.

•

We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

•

We read relevant regulatory orders issued by regulatory commissions, regulatory statutes, interpretations, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedence of regulatory commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.

•

For regulatory matters in process, including those that could impact the Greater Lawrence Incident pipeline replacement, we inspected the Company’s filings with regulatory commissions and the filings with regulatory commissions by intervenors for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions related to recoverability of recorded assets

.

•

We inquired of management about property, plant, and equipment that may be abandoned. We inspected minutes of meetings of the board of directors and regulatory orders and other filings with regulatory commissions to identify evidence that may contradict management’s assertion regarding probability of an abandonment.

•

We obtained an analysis from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.

•

We evaluated the impact of the February 26, 2020 sale transaction on the carrying value of the Company’s utility property, plant, and equipment as of December 31, 2019.

Impairment of the Franchise Rights Intangible Asset & the Columbia of Massachusetts Reporting Unit Goodwill  - Refer to Note 6 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the fourth quarter to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair values of the long-lived assets (including the franchise rights intangible asset) and goodwill of Columbia of Massachusetts (CMA), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, were below their carrying amount. The totality of several factors led to the Company concluding that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the CMA reporting unit and the value of CMA’s long-lived assets were below their carrying values. These factors included: (1) increased Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU) regulatory enforcement activity related to CMA, including (i) an order imposing work restrictions on CMA, (ii) two orders opening public investigations into CMA related to the Greater Lawrence Incident and restoration efforts following the incident, and (iii) an order defining the scope of the DPU’s investigation into the preparation and response of CMA related to the incident; (2) increased uncertainty as to the ability of CMA to execute its growth strategy, including utility infrastructure

investments, and CMA’s ability to obtain timely regulatory outcomes with reasonable rates of return; (3) further damage to CMA’s reputation; and (4) the potential sale of the Company's business in Massachusetts.

The Company performed a long-lived asset impairment test as of December 31, 2019 in which it compared the book value of the CMA asset group to its undiscounted future cash flows and determined that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable. The Company estimated the fair value of the CMA asset group using a weighting of income and market approaches and determined that the fair value was less than the carrying value. The resulting impairment loss was allocated to reduce the recorded franchise rights intangible asset to its fair value of zero, which resulted in an impairment charge totaling $209.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company also performed a goodwill impairment test for the CMA reporting unit as of December 31, 2019. As part of this test, the Company estimated CMA’s fair value based on a weighting of income and market approaches. This impairment analysis indicated that the fair value of the CMA reporting unit was below its carrying value and, as a result, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge totaling $204.8 million.

We identified the impairment of the franchise rights intangible asset and the CMA reporting unit goodwill as a critical audit matter as there was a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying procedures relating to the allocation of impairment to CMA’s long-lived assets and the fair value measurement of the reporting unit. This was driven by significant management judgment when determining fair value, including (1) the weightings of the fair value approaches, (2) the future cash flows used in the impairment tests, and (3) other inputs used in the valuation including comparable company multiples, discount rates, and return on equity. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of fair value specialists to assist in performing audit procedures over these assumptions and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the impairment of CMA’s franchise rights intangible asset and CMA reporting unit goodwill included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the impairments, including (1) validation of the assumptions included in the impairment analysis for both the franchise rights intangible asset and goodwill, (2) the evaluation of the methodology used in determining the magnitude of impairment charges as of December 31, 2019, and (3) the verification of the completeness and accuracy of the journal entry made to record the impairments and the related disclosures.

•

We evaluated the inputs used in the franchise rights intangible asset and goodwill impairment tests, including cash flow projections, scenario analysis, discount rates, return on equity assumptions, and comparable company multiples.

•

We compared the undiscounted cash flows used in the franchise rights intangible asset impairment test to the carrying value of the asset group to evaluate whether an impairment existed at December 31, 2019.

•

With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the calculated amount of fair value of the franchise rights intangible asset.

•

We evaluated the allocation of impairment to the franchise rights intangible asset.

•

We evaluated the relative weightings of the income and market approaches used to estimate fair value for the purposes of the goodwill impairment test.

•

We evaluated the reasonableness of the fair value calculated under the combination of income and market approaches by comparing it to the fair value used in the May 1, 2019 goodwill impairment test.

•

We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impairment charges.

Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

A.

Company Structure and Principles of Consolidation.

We are an energy holding company incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in Merrillville, Indiana. Our subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving approximately

4.0

million customers in seven states. We generate substantially all of our operating income through these rate-regulated businesses. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of us and our majority-owned subsidiaries after the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions.

On February 26, 2020, NiSource and Columbia of Massachusetts entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement with Eversource, a Massachusetts voluntary association.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement, NiSource and Columbia of Massachusetts agreed to sell to Eversource, with certain additions and exceptions, (1) substantially all of the assets of Columbia of Massachusetts and (2) all of the assets held by any of Columbia of Massachusetts’ affiliates that primarily relate to the business of storing, distributing or transporting natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers in Massachusetts, as conducted by Columbia of Massachusetts, and Eversource agreed to assume certain liabilities of Columbia of Massachusetts and its affiliates.  For additional information, see Note 26, “Subsequent Event.”

B.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

C.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash.

We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We report amounts deposited in brokerage accounts for margin requirements as restricted cash. In addition, we have amounts deposited in trust to satisfy requirements for the provision of various property, liability, workers compensation, and long-term disability insurance, which is classified as restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and disclosed with cash and cash equivalents on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.

D.

Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenue.

Accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes both billed and unbilled amounts. Unbilled amounts of accounts receivable relate to a portion of a customer’s consumption of gas or electricity from the last cycle billing date through the last day of the month (balance sheet date). Factors taken into consideration when estimating unbilled revenue include historical usage, customer rates and weather. Accounts receivable fluctuates from year to year depending in large part on weather impacts and price volatility. Our accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets include unbilled revenue, less reserves, in the amounts of

$

350.5

million

and

$

324.2

million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. The reserve for uncollectible receivables is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable. We determined the reserve based on historical experience and in consideration of current market conditions. Account balances are charged against the allowance when it is anticipated the receivable will not be recovered. Refer to Note


, "Revenue Recognition," for additional information on customer-related accounts receivable.

E.

Investments in Debt Securities.

Our investments in debt securities are carried at fair value and are designated as available-for-sale. These investments are included within “Other investments” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. These investments are monitored for other than temporary declines in market value. Realized gains and losses and permanent impairments are reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss).

No

material impairment charges were recorded for the years ended

December 31, 2019

. Refer to Note


, "Fair Value," for additional information.

F.

Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.

Rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and it is probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are later recognized in income as the related amounts are included in customer rates and recovered from or refunded to customers.

In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for us to recover our costs in the future, all or a portion of our regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for regulatory accounting. In such an event, a write-down of all or a portion of our existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery was approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under GAAP for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply

the provisions of regulatory accounting, we would be required to apply the provisions of ASC 980-20,

Discontinuation of Rate-Regulated Accounting

. In management’s opinion, our regulated subsidiaries will be subject to regulatory accounting for the foreseeable future. Refer to Note


, "Regulatory Matters," for additional information.

G.

Plant and Other Property and Related Depreciation and Maintenance.

Property, plant and equipment (principally utility plant) is stated at cost. The rate-regulated subsidiaries record depreciation using composite rates on a straight-line basis over the remaining service lives of the electric, gas and common properties as approved by the appropriate regulators.

Non-utility property is generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over the life of the associated asset. Refer to Note


, "Property, Plant and Equipment," for additional information related to depreciation expense.

For rate-regulated companies, AFUDC is capitalized on all classes of property except organization costs, land, autos, office equipment, tools and other general property purchases. The allowance is applied to construction costs for that period of time between the date of the expenditure and the date on which such project is placed in service. Our pre-tax rate for AFUDC was

3.0

%

in


,

3.5

%

in


and

4.0

%

in


.

Generally, our subsidiaries follow the practice of charging maintenance and repairs, including the cost of removal of minor items of property, to expense as incurred. When our subsidiaries retire regulated property, plant and equipment, original cost plus the cost of retirement, less salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation. However, when it becomes probable a regulated asset will be retired substantially in advance of its original expected useful life or is abandoned, the cost of the asset and the corresponding accumulated depreciation is recognized as a separate asset. If the asset is still in operation, the net amount is classified as "Other property, at cost, less accumulated depreciation" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the asset is no longer operating, the net amount is classified in "Regulatory assets" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If we are able to recover a full return of and on investment, the carrying value of the asset is based on historical cost. If we are not able to recover a full return on investment, a loss on impairment is recognized to the extent the net book value of the asset exceeds the present value of future revenues discounted at the incremental borrowing rate.

When our subsidiaries sell entire regulated operating units, or retire or sell nonregulated properties, the original cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization balances are removed from "Property, Plant and Equipment" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any gain or loss is recorded in earnings, unless otherwise required by the applicable regulatory body. Refer to Note


, "Property, Plant and Equipment," for further information.

External and internal costs associated with computer software developed for internal use are capitalized. Capitalization of such costs commences upon the completion of the preliminary stage of each project. Once the installed software is ready for its intended use, such capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis generally over a period of five years, except for certain significant enterprise-wide technology investments which are amortized over a ten-year period.

External and internal up-front implementation costs associated with cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Once the installed software is ready for its intended use, such deferred costs are amortized on a straight-line basis to "Operation and maintenance," over the minimum term of the contract plus contractually-provided renewal periods that are reasonable expected to be exercised -- generally up to a maximum of five years.

H.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Substantially all of our goodwill relates to the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired in the Columbia acquisition on November 1, 2000. We test our goodwill for impairment annually as of May 1, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. Fair value of our reporting units is determined using a combination of income and market approaches.

We had other intangible assets consisting primarily of franchise rights apart from goodwill that were identified as part of the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts, which were being amortized on a straight-line basis over

forty

years from the date of acquisition.

During the fourth quarter of 2019, we impaired goodwill and intangible assets related to Columbia of Massachusetts. See Note


, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," for additional information.

I.

Accounts Receivable Transfer Program.

Certain of our subsidiaries have agreements with third parties to transfer certain accounts receivable without recourse. These transfers of accounts receivable are accounted for as secured borrowings. The entire gross receivables balance remains on the

in the amount of proceeds received from the transferees involved in the transactions. Refer to Note


, "Transfers of Financial Assets," for further information.

J.

Gas Cost and Fuel Adjustment Clause.

Our regulated subsidiaries defer most differences between gas and fuel purchase costs and the recovery of such costs in revenues, and adjust future billings for such deferrals on a basis consistent with applicable state-approved tariff provisions. These deferred balances are recorded as "Regulatory assets" or "Regulatory liabilities," as appropriate, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note


, "Regulatory Matters," for additional information.

K.

Inventory.

Both the LIFO inventory methodology and the weighted average cost methodology are used to value natural gas in storage, as approved by regulators for all of our regulated subsidiaries. Inventory valued using LIFO was

$

47.2

million

and

$

47.5

million

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. Based on the average cost of gas using the LIFO method, the estimated replacement cost of gas in storage was less than the stated LIFO cost by

$

and

$

December 31, 2019

and

$

239.3

million

at

December 31, 2018

.

Electric production fuel is valued using the weighted average cost inventory methodology, as approved by NIPSCO's regulator.

Materials and supplies are valued using the weighted average cost inventory methodology.

L.

Accounting for Exchange and Balancing Arrangements of Natural Gas.

Our Gas Distribution Operations segment enters into balancing and exchange arrangements of natural gas as part of its operations and off-system sales programs. We record a receivable or payable for any of our respective cumulative gas imbalances, as well as for any gas inventory borrowed or lent under a Gas Distribution Operations exchange agreement. Exchange gas is valued based on individual regulatory jurisdiction requirements (for example, historical spot rate, spot at the beginning of the month).  These receivables and payables are recorded as “Exchange gas receivable” or “Exchange gas payable” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as appropriate.

M.

Accounting for Risk Management Activities.

We account for our derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with ASC 815. We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, unless such contracts are exempted as a normal purchase normal sale under the provisions of the standard. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation.

We have elected not to net fair value amounts for any of our derivative instruments or the fair value amounts recognized for the right to receive cash collateral or obligation to pay cash collateral arising from those derivative instruments recognized at fair value, which are executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. See Note


, "Risk Management Activities," for additional information.

N.

Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits.

We record income taxes to recognize full interperiod tax allocations.

Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are provided for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Investment tax credits associated with regulated operations are deferred and amortized as a reduction to income tax expense over the estimated useful lives of the related properties.

To the extent certain deferred income taxes of the regulated companies are recoverable or payable through future rates, regulatory assets and liabilities have been established. Regulatory assets for income taxes are primarily attributable to property-related tax timing differences for which deferred taxes had not been provided in the past, when regulators did not recognize such taxes as costs in the rate-making process. Regulatory liabilities for income taxes are primarily attributable to the regulated companies’ obligation to refund to ratepayers deferred income taxes provided at rates higher than the current Federal income tax rate. Such property-related amounts are credited to ratepayers using either the average rate assumption method or the reverse South Georgia method. Non property-related amounts are credited to ratepayers consistent with state utility commission direction.

Pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code and relevant state taxing authorities, we and our subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns for federal and certain state jurisdictions. We and our subsidiaries are parties to a tax sharing agreement.  Income taxes recorded by each party represent amounts that would be owed had the party been separately subject to tax.

O.

Environmental Expenditures.

We accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, regardless of when the expenditures are actually made. The undiscounted estimated future expenditures are based on currently enacted laws and regulations, existing technology and estimated site-specific costs where assumptions may be made about the nature and extent of site contamination, the extent of



N

NC

.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

cleanup efforts, costs of alternative cleanup methods and other variables. The liability is adjusted as further information is discovered or circumstances change. The accruals for estimated environmental expenditures are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in “Legal and environmental” for short-term portions of these liabilities and “Other noncurrent liabilities” for the respective long-term portions of these liabilities. Rate-regulated subsidiaries applying regulatory accounting establish regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the extent that future recovery of environmental remediation costs is probable through the regulatory process. Refer to Note


, "Other Commitments and Contingencies," for further information.

P.

Excise Taxes.

As an agent for some state and local governments, we invoice and collect certain excise taxes levied by state and local governments on customers and record these amounts as liabilities payable to the applicable taxing jurisdiction.  Such balances are presented within "Other accruals" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These types of taxes collected from customers, comprised largely of sales taxes, are presented on a net basis affecting neither revenues nor cost of sales. We account for excise taxes for which we are liable by recording a liability for the expected tax with a corresponding charge to “Other taxes” expense on the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss).

Q.

Accrued Insurance Liabilities.

We accrue for insurance costs related to workers compensation, automobile, property, general and employment practices liabilities based on the most probable value of each claim. In general, claim values are determined by professional, licensed loss adjusters who consider the facts of the claim, anticipated indemnification and legal expenses, and respective state rules. Claims are reviewed by us at least quarterly and an adjustment is made to the accrual based on the most current information. Refer to Note


-E "Other Matters" for further information on accrued insurance liabilities related to the Greater Lawrence Incident.

Revenue Recognition

In


, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). ASU 2014-09 outlines a single, comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of the new standard is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In


, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations, and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. We adopted the provisions of ASC 606 beginning on

January 1, 2018

using a modified retrospective method, which was applied to all contracts. No material adjustments were made to

January 1, 2018

opening balances as a result of the adoption. As required under the modified retrospective method of adoption, results for reporting periods beginning after

January 1, 2018

are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC 605.

The table below provides results for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


as if it had been prepared under historic accounting guidance. We included operating revenue information for the year ended

December 31, 2017

for comparability.

Beginning in


with the adoption of ASC 606, the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss) disaggregates “Customer revenues” (i.e. ASC 606 Revenues) from “Other revenues,” both of which are discussed in more detail below.

Customer Revenues.

Substantially all of our revenues are tariff-based, which we have concluded is within the scope of ASC 606. Under ASC 606, the recipients of our utility service meet the definition of a customer, while the operating company tariffs represent an agreement that meets the definition of a contract. ASC 606 defines a contract as an agreement between two or more parties, in this case us and the customer, which creates enforceable rights and obligations. In order to be considered a contract, we have determined that it is probable that substantially all of the consideration to which we are entitled from customers will be collected upon satisfaction of performance obligations. We maintain common utility credit risk mitigation practices, including requiring deposits and actively pursuing collection of past due amounts. In addition, our regulated operations utilize certain regulatory mechanisms that facilitate recovery of bad debt costs within tariff-based rates, which provides further evidence of collectibility.

Customers in certain of our jurisdictions participate in programs that allow for a fixed payment each month regardless of usage. Payments received that exceed the value of gas or electricity actually delivered are recorded as a liability and presented in "Customer Deposits and Credits"  on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts in this account are reduced and revenue is recorded when customer usage begins to exceed payments received.

We have identified our performance obligations created under tariff-based sales as 1) the commodity (natural gas or electricity, which includes generation and capacity) and 2) delivery. These commodities are sold and / or delivered to and generally consumed by customers simultaneously, leading to satisfaction of our performance obligations over time as gas or electricity is delivered to customers. Due to the at-will nature of utility customers, performance obligations are limited to the services requested and received to date. Once complete, we generally maintain no additional performance obligations.

Transaction prices for each performance obligation are generally prescribed by each operating company’s respective tariff. Rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel and purchased power costs and cost of natural gas. Revenues are adjusted for differences between actual costs subject to reconciliation and the amounts billed in current rates. Under or over recovered revenues related to these cost recovery mechanisms are included in "Regulatory Assets" or "Regulatory Liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recovered from or returned to customers through adjustments to tariff rates. As we provide and deliver service to customers, revenue is recognized based on the transaction price allocated to each performance obligation. In general, revenue recognized from tariff-based sales is equivalent to the value of natural gas or electricity supplied and billed each period, in addition to an estimate for deliveries completed during the period but not yet billed to the customer.

In addition to tariff-based sales, our Gas Distribution Operations segment enters into balancing and exchange arrangements of natural gas as part of our operations and off-system sales programs. We have concluded that these sales are within the scope of ASC 606. Performance obligations for these types of sales include transportation and storage of natural gas and can be satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time, depending on the specific transaction. For those transactions that span a period of time, we record a receivable or payable for any cumulative gas imbalances, as well as for any gas inventory borrowed or lent under a Gas Distributions Operations exchange agreement.

Revenue Disaggregation and Reconciliation.

We disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers based upon reportable segment as well as by customer class. As our revenues are primarily earned over a period of time, and we do not earn a material amount of revenues at a point in time, revenues are not disaggregated as such below. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia,

Customer revenue amounts exclude intersegment revenues. See Note


, "Segments of Business," for discussion of intersegment revenues.

Customer revenue amounts exclude intersegment revenues. See Note


, "Segments of Business," for discussion of intersegment revenues.

Customer Accounts Receivable.

Accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets includes both billed and unbilled amounts, as well as certain amounts that are not related to customer revenues. Unbilled amounts of accounts receivable relate to a portion of a customer’s consumption of gas or electricity from the date of the last cycle billing through the last day of the month (balance sheet date). Factors taken into consideration when estimating unbilled revenue include historical usage, customer rates and weather.

The opening and closing balances of customer receivables for the years ended

December 31, 2019

are presented in the table below. We had no significant contract assets or liabilities during the period. Additionally, we have not incurred any significant costs to obtain or fulfill contracts.

Customer billed receivables decreased due to decreased natural gas costs and warmer weather in


compared to

Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. We generally expect that substantially all customer accounts receivable will be collected within the month following customer billing, as this revenue consists primarily of monthly, tariff-based billings for service and usage.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Other Revenues.

As permitted by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, regulated utilities have the ability to earn certain types of revenue that are outside the scope of ASC 606. These revenues primarily represent revenue earned under alternative revenue programs. Alternative revenue programs represent regulator-approved programs that allow for the adjustment of billings and revenue for certain broad, external factors, or for additional billings if the entity achieves certain objectives, such as a specified reduction of costs. We maintain a variety of these programs, including demand side management initiatives that recover costs associated with the implementation of energy efficiency programs, as well as normalization programs that adjust revenues for the effects of weather or other external factors. Additionally, we maintain certain programs with future test periods that operate similarly to FERC formula rate programs and allow for recovery of costs incurred to replace aging infrastructure. When the criteria to recognize alternative revenue have been met, we establish a regulatory asset and present revenue from alternative revenue programs on the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss) as “Other revenues.” When amounts previously recognized under alternative revenue accounting guidance are billed, we reduce the regulatory asset and record a customer account receivable.


.

Earnings Per Share

Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The weighted-average shares outstanding for diluted EPS includes the incremental effects of the various long-term incentive compensation plans and forward agreements when the impact of such plans and agreements would be dilutive. The calculation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2018 does not include any dilutive potential common shares as we had a net loss on the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss) for that period, and any incremental shares would have had an anti-dilutive impact on EPS. The calculation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 excludes the impact of forward agreements, which had an anti-dilutive effect for that period.

The computation of diluted average common shares is as follows:

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible and Other Long-Lived Assets Impairment.

Our intangible assets, apart from goodwill, consist of franchise rights. Franchise rights were identified as part of the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisition in February 1999 of Columbia of Massachusetts. We review our definite-lived intangible assets, along with other long-lived assets (utility plant), for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets' fair value might be below their carrying amount.

During the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the preparation of the year-end financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of our long-lived assets (including franchise rights) were below their carrying amount. While there was no single determinative event or factor, the consideration in totality of several factors that developed during the fourth quarter of 2019 led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit and the value of its long-lived assets was below

OURCE

.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

its carrying value.  These factors included: (i) increased Massachusetts DPU regulatory enforcement activity related to Columbia of Massachusetts during the fourth quarter, including (a) an order imposing work restrictions on Columbia of Massachusetts, impacting Columbia of Massachusetts' infrastructure replacement program, (b) two orders opening public investigations into Columbia of Massachusetts related to the Greater Lawrence Incident and restoration efforts following the incident, and (c) an order defining the scope of the Massachusetts DPU's investigation into the preparation and response of Columbia of Massachusetts related to the incident; (ii) increased uncertainty as to the ability of Columbia of Massachusetts to execute its growth strategy, including utility infrastructure investments, and to obtain timely regulatory outcomes with reasonable rates of return; (iii) further damage to Columbia of Massachusetts' reputation as a result of concerns related to service lines abandoned during the restoration work following the Greater Lawrence Incident and the gas release event in Lawrence, Massachusetts on September 27, 2019; and (iv) the potential sale of the Massachusetts Business.  See Note


, "Other Commitments and Contingencies - C. Legal Proceedings" for more information regarding Massachusetts DPU regulatory enforcement activity. See Note 26, "Subsequent Event" for more information on the potential sale of the Massachusetts Business.

As a result, we performed a year-end impairment test of the held and used long-lived assets in which we compared the book value of the Columbia of Massachusetts asset group to its undiscounted future cash flow and determined the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable.  We estimated the fair value of the Columbia of Massachusetts asset group using a weighting of income and market approaches and determined that the fair value was less than the carrying value. This resulting impairment was allocated to reduce the entire franchise rights book value to its fair value of zero, which resulted in an impairment charge totaling

$

209.7

million

recorded in the Gas Distribution Operations segment.

We also considered if any regulatory assets or ROU assets were  probable of disallowance and determined no disallowances were probable. All of Columbia of Massachusetts' regulatory assets represent incurred costs probable of recovery.

As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the carrying amount of the franchise rights was

$

0.0

million

and

$

million

(net of accumulated amortization of

), respectively. We recorded amortization expense of

$

million

in


,


and


related to our franchise rights intangible asset.

Goodwill.

Substantially all of our goodwill relates to the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired in the Columbia acquisition on November 1, 2000.

The following presents our goodwill balance allocated by segment as of

December 31, 2019

and


:

For our annual goodwill impairment analysis performed as of May 1, 2019, we completed a qualitative "step 0" analysis for all reporting units other than our Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit. In the step 0 analysis, we assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the applicable reporting units as compared to their baseline May 1, 2016 "step 1" fair value measurement. The results of this assessment indicated that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of these reporting units were less than their respective carrying values, accordingly, no "step 1" analysis was required.

The results of our Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit were negatively impacted by the Greater Lawrence Incident (see Note


-C, "Legal Proceedings"). As a result, we completed a quantitative "step 1" analysis for the May 1, 2019 goodwill analysis for this reporting unit. This analysis considered the progress Columbia of Massachusetts had made with its restoration efforts related to the Greater Lawrence Incident, including the replacement of previously repaired equipment and the settlement agreement with the three impacted municipalities, as well as the ability for Columbia of Massachusetts to sustain its infrastructure replacement growth strategy through GSEP and timely rate cases with reasonable rates of return. Consistent with our historical impairment testing of goodwill, fair value of the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches. These approaches require significant judgments, including appropriate long-term growth rates and discount rates for the income approach and appropriate multiples of earnings for peer companies and control premiums for the market approach. These approaches also incorporate the latest available cash flow projections reflecting the estimated ongoing impacts of the Greater Lawrence Incident on Columbia of Massachusetts’ operations. The discount rates were derived using peer company

data compiled with the assistance of a third party valuation services firm. The discount rates used are subject to change based on changes in tax rates at both the state and federal level, debt and equity ratios at each reporting unit and general economic conditions. The long-term growth rate was derived by evaluating historic growth rates, new business and investment opportunities beyond the near term horizon. The long-term growth rate is subject to change depending on inflationary impacts to the U.S. economy and the individual business environments in which each reporting unit operates. The step 1 analysis performed indicated that the fair value of the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. As a result, no impairment charge was recorded as of the May 1, 2019 test date.

Although our annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter, we continue to monitor changes in circumstances that may indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than the reporting unit carrying value. During the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the preparation of the year-end financial statements, we assessed the matters related to Columbia of Massachusetts.  These factors were the same fourth quarter circumstances outlined in the intangible and other long-lived assets impairment above.

As a result, a new impairment analysis was required for our Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit. Consistent with the May 1, 2019 test, fair value of this reporting unit was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches. The income approach calculated discounted cash flows using updated cash flow projections, discount rates and return on equity assumptions. The market approach applied a combination of comparable company multiples and comparable transactions and used updated cash flow projections. While certain assumptions, such as market multiples, remained unchanged in the year-end test, our cash flow projections, return on equity and rate case assumptions were all unfavorably updated at year-end compared to the May 1, 2019 test. The effects of these unfavorable developments were greater than the favorable change in weighted average cost of capital between the two tests. The year-end impairment analysis indicated that the fair value of the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit was below its carrying value. As a result, we reduced the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit goodwill balance to zero and recognized a goodwill impairment charge totaling

$

204.8

million

, which is non-deductible for tax purposes.

Asset Retirement Obligations

We have recognized asset retirement obligations associated with various legal obligations including costs to remove and dispose of certain construction materials located within many of our facilities, certain costs to retire pipeline, removal costs for certain underground storage tanks, removal of certain pipelines known to contain PCB contamination, closure costs for certain sites including ash ponds, solid waste management units and a landfill, as well as some other nominal asset retirement obligations. We also have a significant obligation associated with the decommissioning of our

two

hydro facilities located in Indiana. These hydro facilities have an indeterminate life, and as such, no asset retirement obligation has been recorded.

Changes in our liability for asset retirement obligations for the years


and


are presented in the table below:

(1)

The change in estimated cash flows for 2019 is primarily attributed to changes in estimated costs and settlement timing for electric generating stations and the changes in estimated costs for retirement of gas mains.

(2)

In 2018,

$

59.8

million

of additions and

$

17.7

Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income or expense are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in the income statement as the related amounts are included in customer rates and recovered from or refunded to customers.

Regulatory assets were comprised of the following items:

Regulatory liabilities were comprised of the following items:

Regulatory assets, including under-recovered gas and fuel cost, of approximately

$

1,524.3

million

as of

December 31, 2019

are not earning a return on investment. These costs are recovered over a remaining life of up to


years. Regulatory assets of approximately

million

include expenses that are recovered as components of the cost of service and are covered by regulatory orders. Regulatory assets of approximately

$

307.2

million

at

December 31, 2019

, require specific rate action.

Assets:

Unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit costs.

In 2007, we adopted certain updates of ASC 715 which required, among other things, the recognition in other comprehensive income or loss of the actuarial gains or losses and the prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but that are not immediately recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs. Certain subsidiaries defer these gains or losses as a regulatory asset in accordance with regulatory orders or as a result of regulatory precedent, to be recovered through base rates.

Deferred pension and other postretirement benefit costs.

Primarily relates to the difference between postretirement expense recorded by certain subsidiaries due to regulatory orders and the postretirement expense recorded in accordance with GAAP. These costs are expected to be collected through future base rates, revenue riders or tracking mechanisms.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Environmental costs.

Includes certain recoverable costs of investigating, testing, remediating and other costs related to gas plant sites, disposal sites or other sites onto which material may have migrated. Certain of our companies defer the costs as a regulatory asset in accordance with regulatory orders, to be recovered in future base rates, billing riders or tracking mechanisms.

Regulatory effects of accounting for income taxes.

Represents the deferral and under collection of deferred taxes in the rate making process. In prior years, we have lowered customer rates in certain jurisdictions for the benefits of accelerated tax deductions. Amounts are expensed for financial reporting purposes as we recover deferred taxes in the rate making process.

Under-recovered gas and fuel costs.

Represents the difference between the costs of gas and fuel and the recovery of such costs in revenue and is used to adjust future billings for such deferrals on a basis consistent with applicable state-approved tariff provisions. Recovery of these costs is achieved through tracking mechanisms.

Depreciation.

Represents differences between depreciation expense incurred on a GAAP basis and that prescribed through regulatory order. Significant components of this balance include:

•

Columbia of Ohio depreciation rates

. Prior to 2005, the PUCO-approved depreciation rates for rate-making had been lower than those which would have been utilized if Columbia of Ohio were not subject to regulation resulting in the creation of a regulatory asset. In 2005, the PUCO authorized Columbia of Ohio to revise its depreciation accrual rates for the period beginning January 1, 2005. The revised depreciation rates are higher than those which would have been utilized if Columbia of Ohio were not subject to regulation  allowing for amortization of the previously created regulatory asset. The amount of depreciation that would have been recorded from 2005 through


had Columbia of Ohio not been subject to rate regulation is a cumulative

$

923.5

million

,

$

103.8

million

less than that reflected in rates. The resulting regulatory asset balance was

$

27.9

million

and

$

39.5

million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

•

Columbia of Ohio IRP and CEP.

Columbia of Ohio also has PUCO approval to defer depreciation and debt-based post-in-service carrying charges (see "

Post-in-service carrying charges"

below) associated with its IRP and CEP. As of

December 31, 2019

, depreciation of

$

31.9

million

and

$

77.2

million

was deferred for the respective programs. Depreciation deferral balances for the respective programs as of December 31, 2018 were

$

29.1

million

and

$

76.0

million

. Recovery of the depreciation is approved annually through the IRP and CEP riders. The equivalent of annual depreciation expense, based on the average life of the related assets, is included in the calculation of the IRP and CEP riders approved by the PUCO and billed to customers. Deferred depreciation expense is recognized as the IRP and CEP riders are billed to customers.

•

NIPSCO ECRM.

NIPSCO obtained approval from the IURC to recover certain environmental related costs including operation and maintenance and depreciation expense once the environmental facilities become operational. The ECRM deferred charges represent expenses that will be recovered from customers through an annual ECRM Cost Tracker (ECT) which authorizes the collection of deferred balances over a six month period. Depreciation of $

15.2

million

and $

14.4

million

was deferred to a regulatory asset as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. This regulatory asset was included in electric base rates, which was approved by the IURC on December 4, 2019.

•

NIPSCO TDSIC.

NIPSCO obtained approval from the IURC to recover costs for certain system modernization projects outside of a base rate proceeding. Eighty percent of the related costs, including depreciation, property taxes, and debt and equity based carrying charges (see

"Post-in-service carrying charges"

below) are recovered through a semi-annual recovery mechanism. Recovery of these costs will continue through the TDSIC tracker until such assets are included in rate base through a gas or electric base rate case, respectively. The remaining twenty percent of the costs are deferred until the next base rate case. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, depreciation of $

22.0

million

and $

16.5

million

, respectively, was deferred as a regulatory asset.

Post-in-service carrying charges.

Represents deferred debt-based carrying charges incurred on certain assets placed into service but not yet included in customer rates. This balance includes:

•

Columbia of Ohio IRP and CEP.

See description of IRP and CEP programs above under the heading "

Depreciation

." As of

December 31, 2019

and


, Columbia of Ohio had deferred PISCC of $

206.4

, respectively.

•

NIPSCO TDSIC.

See description of TDSIC program above under the heading "

Depreciation

." Deferral of equity-based carrying charges for the TDSIC program is allowed; however, such amounts are not reflected in regulatory asset balances for financial reporting as equity-based returns do not meet the definition of incurred costs under ASC 980. As of

Safety activity costs.

Represents the difference between costs incurred in eligible safety programs in excess of those being recovered in rates.  The eligible cost deferrals represent necessary business expenses incurred in compliance with PHMSA regulations and are targeted to enhance the safety of the pipeline systems. Certain subsidiaries defer the excess costs as a regulatory asset in accordance with regulatory orders and recovery of these costs will be addressed in future base rate proceedings.

DSM programs.

Represents costs associated with Gas Distribution Operations and Electric Operations segments' energy efficiency and conservation programs. Costs are recovered through tracking mechanisms.

Bailly Generating Station.

Represents the net book value of Units 7 and 8 of Bailly Generating Station that was retired during 2018. These amounts are currently being amortized at a rate consistent with their inclusion in customer rates.

Liabilities:

Over-recovered gas and fuel costs.

Represents the difference between the cost of gas and fuel and the recovery of such costs in revenues and is the basis to adjust future billings for such refunds on a basis consistent with applicable state-approved tariff provisions. Refunding of these revenues is achieved through tracking mechanisms.

Cost of removal.

Represents anticipated costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and collected in customer rates of the rate-regulated subsidiaries for future costs to be incurred.

Regulatory effects of accounting for income taxes.

Represents amounts owed to customers for deferred taxes collected at a higher rate than the current statutory rates and liabilities associated with accelerated tax deductions owed to customers that are established during the rate making process. Balance includes excess deferred taxes recorded upon implementation of the TCJA in December 2017, net of amounts amortized through 2019.

Deferred pension and other postretirement benefit costs.

Primarily represents cash contributions in excess of postretirement benefit expense that is deferred as a regulatory liability by certain subsidiaries in accordance with regulatory orders.

Cost Recovery and Trackers

Comparability of our line item operating results is impacted by regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as those described below. Increases in the expenses that are the subject of trackers generally result in a corresponding increase in operating revenues and, therefore, have essentially no impact on total operating income results.

Certain costs of our operating companies are significant, recurring in nature and generally outside the control of the operating companies. Some states allow the recovery of such costs through cost tracking mechanisms. Such tracking mechanisms allow for abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the operating companies to implement charges and recover appropriate costs. Tracking mechanisms allow for more timely recovery of such costs as compared with more traditional cost recovery mechanisms. Examples of such mechanisms include GCR adjustment mechanisms, tax riders, bad debt recovery mechanisms, electric energy efficiency programs, MISO non-fuel costs and revenues, resource capacity charges, federally mandated costs and environmental-related costs.

A portion of the Gas Distribution revenue is related to the recovery of gas costs, the review and recovery of which occurs through standard regulatory proceedings. All states in our operating area require periodic review of actual gas procurement activity to determine prudence and to permit the recovery of prudently incurred costs related to the supply of gas for customers. Our distribution companies have historically been found prudent in the procurement of gas supplies to serve customers.

A portion of the Electric Operations revenue is related to the recovery of fuel costs to generate power and the fuel costs related to purchased power. These costs are recovered through a FAC, a quarterly regulatory proceeding in Indiana.

Infrastructure Replacement and Federally-Mandated Compliance Programs

All of our operating utility companies have completed rate proceedings involving infrastructure replacement or enhancement, and have embarked upon initiatives to replace significant portions of their operating systems that are nearing the end of their useful lives. Each company's approach to cost recovery is unique, given the different laws, regulations and precedent that exist in each jurisdiction.

Columbia of Ohio, IRP

- On December 3, 2008, the PUCO issued an order which established Columbia of Ohio’s IRP. Pursuant to that order, the IRP provides for recovery of costs resulting from: (1) the maintenance, repair and replacement of customer-owned service lines that have been determined by Columbia of Ohio to present an existing or probable hazard to persons and property;

(2) Columbia of Ohio’s replacement of cast iron, wrought iron, unprotected coated steel and bare steel pipe and associated company and customer-owned metallic service lines; (3) the replacement of customer-owned natural gas risers identified by the PUCO as prone to failure; and (4) the installation of AMR devices on all residential and commercial meters served by Columbia of Ohio. Recoverable costs include a return on investment, depreciation and property taxes, offset by specified cost savings. Columbia of Ohio’s five-year IRP plan renewal was last approved on January 31, 2018 for the years 2018-2022.

Columbia of Ohio, CEP -

On October 3, 2011, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to establish the CEP that would provide for the deferral of PISCC on those assets placed into service, but not reflected in rates as plant in service, and the deferral of depreciation expense and property taxes directly attributable to the CEP assets for the period October 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012. Capital expenditures covered under this program included those placed into service that were not part of Columbia of Ohio's IRP. CEP was approved by the PUCO on August 29, 2012. Under this program, the PUCO’s approval provided for the deferral of related PISCC, depreciation and property taxes up to the point where the deferred amount, if included in rates, would exceed $1.50 per month impact on the Small General Service class of customers, subject to the PUCO’s determination of the prudence and reasonableness of investments covered under this program in a future regulatory proceeding. Subsequently, on October 3, 2013, the PUCO modified and approved Columbia of Ohio’s application to continue its CEP deferrals in 2013 and succeeding years, subject to the determination of the prudence, reasonableness and magnitude of the deferrals and capital expenditures in a future cost recovery proceeding. On December 1, 2017, Columbia of Ohio filed an application in which it requested authority to implement a rider to begin recovering plant and associated deferrals related to its CEP. On October 25, 2018, a joint stipulation and recommendation was filed to recover CEP investments and deferrals through December 31, 2017, with annual adjustments for capital investments made in subsequent years. Additionally, the signatory parties to the stipulation agreed to a reduction in rates to adjust for the impacts of the Tax Cut Jobs Act and for a base rate case filing to be made by Columbia of Ohio no later than June 30, 2021. On November 28, 2018 the PUCO issued an order unanimously approving the settlement, without modification.

NIPSCO Gas and Electric, TDSIC

- On April 30, 2013, the Indiana Governor signed Senate Enrolled Act 560, known as the TDSIC statute, into law. Among other provisions, the TDSIC statute provides for cost recovery outside of a base rate proceeding for new or replacement electric and gas transmission, distribution, and storage projects that a public utility undertakes for the purposes of safety, reliability, system modernization or economic development. Provisions of the TDSIC statute require that, among other things, requests for recovery include a seven-year plan of eligible investments. Once the plan is approved by the IURC, eighty percent of eligible costs can be recovered using a periodic rate adjustment mechanism, known as the TDSIC mechanism. Recoverable costs include a return on the investment, including AFUDC, PISCC, depreciation and property taxes. The remaining twenty percent of recoverable costs are deferred for future recovery in NIPSCO's next general rate case. This rate adjustment mechanism is typically filed semi-annually and has a cap at an annual increase of two percent of total retail revenues. During the 2019 Legislative session, the Indiana General Assembly amended the TDSIC statute in House Enrolled Act 1470 that was signed into law by the Governor on April 24, 2019.  The revisions that became effective on July 1, 2019 permit flexibility in TDSIC Plans between five and seven years in length, permits the IURC to authorize multi-unit projects that do not include specific locations or an exact number of inspections, repairs, or replacements and projects involving advanced technology investments to support the modernization of transmission, distribution, or storage systems.  The amendments also authorize termination of TDSIC Plans prior to their expiration and provide that the projects associated with the terminated plan will continue to receive TDSIC treatment until an Order is issued in the utility’s next general rate case, and provide for the ability to seek approval of a new TDSIC Plan.  The amended statute also provides that the two percent revenue cap applies to the aggregate of approved TDSIC Plans and requires that the utility file a base rate case at some point during the term of each TDSIC plan. On December 31, 2019, NIPSCO Gas filed a new 6-year TDSIC for the periods 2020 through 2025.

NIPSCO Electric, ECRM

- NIPSCO has approval from the IURC to recover certain environmental related costs through an ECT (environmental cost tracker). Under the ECT, NIPSCO is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by NIPSCO to implement environmental compliance plan projects and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. All deferred costs associated with ECRM were included in electric rate base and approved by the IURC on December 4, 2019.

NIPSCO Gas and Electric, FMCA

- The FMCA statute provides for cost recovery outside of a base rate proceeding for projected federally mandated costs. Once the plan is approved by the IURC, eighty percent of eligible costs can be recovered using a periodic rate adjustment mechanism, known as the FMCA mechanism. Recoverable costs include a return on the investment, including AFUDC, PISCC, mandated operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and property taxes. The remaining twenty percent of recoverable costs are deferred for future recovery in NIPSCO's next general rate case. Actual costs that exceed the projected

federally mandated costs of the approved compliance project by more than twenty-five percent shall require specific justification by NIPSCO and specific approval by the IURC before being authorized in the next general rate case.

Columbia of Massachusetts, GSEP

- On July 7, 2014, the Governor of Massachusetts signed into law Chapter 149 of the Acts of 2014, an Act Relative to Natural Gas Leaks (“the Act”).  Adopted into the Massachusetts Utility Provisions, G.L. c. 164, § 145, the Act authorizes natural gas distribution companies to file a GSEP  for capital investments made on or after January 1, 2015, that are not included in the company’s current rate base as determined in the most recent base rate case, with the Massachusetts DPU to (1) address the replacement or improvement of existing aging natural gas pipeline infrastructure to improve public safety or infrastructure reliability, and (2) reduce the lost and unaccounted for natural gas through a reduction in natural gas system leaks. In addition, the Act provides that the Massachusetts DPU may, after review of the plan, allow the proposed estimated costs of the plan into rates as of May 1 of the subsequent year.  Recoverable costs include a return on investment, depreciation and property taxes, offset by identified operations and maintenance cost savings. Beginning with the 2019 GSEP, rates are subject to a capped annual revenue increase of three percent of total annual firm delivery revenues, plus imputed gas revenues for sales and transportation customers, calculated as the product of (1) the historical average cost of gas per therm, and (2) the average weather normalized sales, for the period beginning with 2013 and ending with the most recent year that actual data is available at the time of the October GSEP Plan filing, per the Massachusetts DPU order in Columbia of Massachusetts' 2019 GSEP.  Prior to the 2019 GSEP, the annual revenue increase was capped at one and a half percent. At the end of each 12-month period, in May of the subsequent year, Columbia of Massachusetts must file a reconciliation of the amount collected and actual costs. Any over-collection or under-collection balance is passed back to, or recovered from, customers through the surcharge over a 12-month period beginning in November. On October 31, 2019, the Massachusetts DPU issued an order on Columbia of Massachusetts' GSEP reconciliation proceeding finding that, due to pending investigations of the Greater Lawrence Incident and other operational matters, the Massachusetts DPU could not, at this time, make a finding of prudence with respect to the Columbia of Massachusetts' 2018 GSEP investments and deferred the decision on the prudency of the 2018 GSEP investments in the annual GSEP and GSEP reconciliation filings until the investigations by the DPU are complete. The DPU added that its inability to make a finding of prudence did not constitute a finding of imprudence. Once new base rates are established under a base rate proceeding, the GSEP factor is re-set to remove the capital investment and associated revenue reflected in the base rates. Columbia of Massachusetts' current five year GSEP plan for the periods 2019-2023 was approved April 30, 2019.

Columbia of Pennsylvania, DSIC

- On February 14, 2012, the Governor of Pennsylvania signed into law Act 11 of 2012, which provided a DSIC mechanism for certain utilities to recover costs related to repair, replacement or improvement of eligible distribution property that has not previously been reflected in rates or rate base. Through a DSIC, a utility may recover the fixed costs of eligible infrastructure incurred during the three months ended one month prior to the effective date of the charge, thereby reducing the historical regulatory lag associated with cost recovery through the traditional rate-making process. On March 14, 2013, the Pennsylvania PUC approved Columbia of Pennsylvania’s petition to implement a DSIC as of April 1, 2013. Accordingly, Columbia of Pennsylvania is authorized to recover the cost of eligible plant associated with repair, replacement or improvement that was not previously reflected in rate base and has been placed in service during the applicable three-month period. After the initial charge is established, the DSIC is updated quarterly to recover the cost of further plant additions and cannot exceed five percent of distribution revenues. Recoverable costs include a return on investment, exclusive of accumulated deferred income taxes from the calculation of rate base, and depreciation. Once new base rates are established under a base rate proceeding, the DSIC is set to zero. Additionally, the DSIC rate is also reset to zero if, in any quarter, the data reflected in the Columbia of Pennsylvania's most recent quarterly financial earnings report show that the utility will earn an overall rate of return that would exceed the allowable rate of return used to calculate its fixed costs under the DSIC mechanism.  A utility is exempt from filing a quarterly financial earnings report when a base rate proceeding is pending before the Pennsylvania PUC.

Columbia of Virginia, SAVE -

On March 11, 2010, the Virginia Governor signed legislation into law that allows natural gas utilities to implement programs to replace qualifying infrastructure on an expedited basis and provides for timely cost recovery.  Known as the SAVE Act, the law allows natural gas utilities to file programs with the VSCC providing a timeline and estimated costs for replacing eligible infrastructure. Eligible infrastructure replacement projects are those that (1) enhance safety or reliability by reducing system integrity risks associated with customer outages, corrosion, equipment failures, material failures, or natural forces; (2) do not increase revenues by directly connecting the infrastructure replacement to new customers; (3) reduce or have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; (4) are not included in the natural gas utility’s rate base in its most recent rate case; and (5) are commenced on or after January 1, 2010. The SAVE Act provides for recovery of costs associated with the eligible infrastructure through a rate rider. Recoverable costs include a return on investment, depreciation and property taxes. Columbia of Virginia’s current five year SAVE plan was approved by the VSCC in 2016 and amended in 2017 for the years 2016 through 2020 and amended in 2019 for calendar year 2020.

Columbia of Kentucky, SMRP (formerly AMRP)

- On October 26, 2009, the Kentucky PSC approved a mechanism for recovering the costs of Columbia of Kentucky’s AMRP not previously reflected in rate base through an annual fixed monthly rate rider filed in October. In its 2013 rate case, Columbia of Kentucky was allowed to base the AMRP rider on the expected annual cost of service. Recoverable costs include a return on investment, depreciation and property taxes, offset by specific cost savings. At the end of each 12-month period, Columbia of Kentucky must file a reconciliation of the amount collected and actual costs. Any over-collection or under-collection balance is passed back to, or recovered from, customers through the surcharge over a 12-month period beginning in June of the subsequent year. Once new base rates are established under a base rate proceeding, the AMRP rider is set to zero.  On July 29, 2019, CKY filed its SMRP to clarify approval of low pressure project spend and expand its AMRP to include for recovery of system safety investments, including low pressure project spend. On November 7, 2019, the Commission approved Columbia of Kentucky's request to amend and expand its annual AMRP to become the SMRP.

Columbia of Maryland, STRIDE

- On May 2, 2013, the Governor of Maryland signed Senate Bill 8 into law, authorizing gas companies to accelerate recovery of eligible infrastructure replacement, effective June 1, 2013. The STRIDE statute provides recovery for gas pipeline upgrades outside of the context of a base rate proceeding through an annual surcharge, IRIS, as approved by the Maryland PSC. The STRIDE statute directs gas utilities to file a plan to invest in eligible infrastructure replacement projects and to list the specific projects and elements in any such STRIDE plan with the Maryland PSC. The calendar year projected capital projects to be placed into plant in service and included in Columbia of Maryland's surcharge recovery request must satisfy a number of criteria per the statute, including a requirement that they be designed to improve public safety or infrastructure reliability.  Columbia of Maryland’s five-year STRIDE Plan renewal for years 2019 through 2023, as with the preceding five years, is focused on replacing (1) existing cast iron and bare steel mains, (2) associated services and meters, and (3) identified prone-to-failure vintage plastic piping. Columbia of Maryland’s IRIS mechanism recovers a return on investment, depreciation and property taxes of the STRIDE-eligible capital infrastructure statutorily capped at $2 per month for residential customers, and proportionally capped for commercial and industrial customer classes, and is reconciled to actual costs on an annual basis. Any over-collection or under-collection balance is passed back to, or recovered from, customers through the surcharge effective in May of the subsequent year, subject to the cap. STRIDE investments, and recovery thereof, are subject to prudency review by the Maryland PSC in the context of quarterly STRIDE update filings and in subsequent rate proceedings where STRIDE assets are rolled into rate base for recovery in base rates.

Rates were implemented in three steps, with implementation of step 1 rates effective October 1, 2018. Step 2 rates were effective on March 1, 2019, and step 3 rates were effective on January 1, 2020. The step 3 increase was approved based on actual information and revised from $107.3 million to $105.6 million. The IURC’s order also dismissed NIPSCO from phase 2 of the IURC’s TCJA investigation.

(2)

Rates, as originally filed, were implemented in February 2019 on an interim basis, subject to refund. The final approved rates, which replaced interim rates, were implemented in July 2019.

(3)

An order was received on December 4, 2019, which included the resolution of outstanding TCJA impacts to rates. Incremental revenues decreased due to a reduction in fuel costs associated with the new industrial service structure. Rates will be implemented in two steps, with implementation of step 1 rates effective January 2, 2020 and step 2 rates effective March 2, 2020.

On March 29, 2018, WCE, which is currently owned by BP p.l.c ("BP") and BP Products North America, which operates the BP Refinery, filed a petition at the IURC asking that the combined operations of WCE and BP be treated as a single premise, and the WCE generation be dedicated primarily to BP Refinery operations beginning in May 2019 as WCE has self-certified as a qualifying facility at FERC. BP Refinery planned to continue to purchase electric service from NIPSCO at a reduced demand level beginning in May 2019; however, a settlement agreement was filed on November 2, 2018 agreeing that BP and WCE would not move forward with construction of a private transmission line to serve BP until conclusion of NIPSCO’s pending electric rate case. The IURC approved the settlement agreement as filed on February 20, 2019.  On December 4, 2019, the IURC issued an order in the electric rate case approving the implementation of a new industrial service structure.  This resolved the issues included in BP’s original petition.

The December 4, 2019 electric rate case order approved the revenue requirement settlement filed in the case, with the exception of a change in the agreed to return on equity; the approved return on equity is 9.75%. The order included approval of the depreciation rates as requested, as well as authorization to create a regulatory asset upon the retirement of R.M. Schahfer Generating Units 14, 15, 17 and 18 and Michigan City Generating Station Unit 12. The order allows for the recovery of and on the net book value of the units by the end of 2032.

Risk Management Activities

We are exposed to certain risks relating to ongoing business operations; namely commodity price risk and interest rate risk. We recognize that the prudent and selective use of derivatives may help to lower our cost of debt capital, manage interest rate exposure and limit volatility in the price of natural gas.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Risk management assets and liabilities on our derivatives are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as shown below:

(1)

Presented in "Prepayments and other" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(2)

Presented in "Deferred charges and other" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(3)

Presented in "Other accruals" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Commodity Price Risk Management

We, along with our utility customers, are exposed to variability in cash flows associated with natural gas purchases and volatility in natural gas prices. We purchase natural gas for sale and delivery to our retail, commercial and industrial customers, and for most customers the variability in the market price of gas is passed through in their rates. Some of our utility subsidiaries offer programs whereby variability in the market price of gas is assumed by the respective utility. The objective of our commodity price risk programs is to mitigate the gas cost variability, for us or on behalf of our customers, associated with natural gas purchases or sales by economically hedging the various gas cost components using a combination of futures, options, forwards or other derivative contracts.

NIPSCO received IURC approval to lock in a fixed price for its natural gas customers using long-term forward purchase instruments.  The term of these instruments range from five to ten years and is limited to

twenty

percent of NIPSCO’s average annual GCA purchase volume. Gains and losses on these derivative contracts are deferred as regulatory liabilities or assets and are remitted to or collected from customers through NIPSCO’s quarterly GCA mechanism. These instruments are not designated as accounting hedges.

Interest Rate Risk Management

As of

December 31, 2019

, we have forward-starting interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value totaling

$

500.0

million

to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate during the periods from the effective dates of the swaps to the anticipated dates of forecasted debt issuances, which are expected to take place by the end of 2024. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. The effective portions of the gains and losses related to these swaps are recorded to AOCI and are recognized in "Interest expense, net" concurrently with the recognition of interest expense on the associated debt, once issued. If it becomes probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will no longer occur, the accumulated gains or losses on the derivative will be recognized currently in "Other, net" in the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss).

The passage of the TCJA and Greater Lawrence Incident led to significant changes to our long-term financing plan. As a result, during


, we settled forward-starting interest rate swaps with a notional value of

$

750.0

million

. These derivative contracts were accounted for as cash flow hedges. As part of the transactions, the associated net unrealized gain of

$

46.2

million

was recognized immediately in "Other, net" on the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss) due to the probability associated with the forecasted borrowing transactions no longer occurring.

and non-deductible fines and penalties related to the Greater Lawrence Incident (see Note 19, "Legal Proceedings" for additional information). The rate is also impacted by the relative impact of permanent differences on higher pre-tax income.

The

was primarily the result of state regulatory proceedings which resulted in a

$

decrease in federal income taxes offset by a related increase in state income taxes of

. Additionally, the increase was driven by a

$

26.9

million

decrease in income taxes related to amortization of the regulatory liability primarily associated with excess deferred taxes.

Net Deferred Income Tax Liability Components

Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. The principal components of our net deferred tax liability were as follows:

At

December 31, 2019

, we had

$

657.1

million

of federal net operating loss carryforwards. The federal net operating loss carryforwards are available to offset taxable income and will begin to expire in

$

107.2

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

We are subject to income taxation in the United States and various state jurisdictions, primarily Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland and Virginia.

We participate in the IRS CAP which provides the opportunity to resolve tax matters with the IRS before filing each year's consolidated federal income tax return. As of

December 31, 2019

, tax years through 2018 have been audited and are effectively closed to further assessment. The audit of tax year 2019 under the CAP program is expected to be completed in 2020.

The statute of limitations in each of the state jurisdictions in which we operate remains open until the years are settled for federal income tax purposes, at which time amended state income tax returns reflecting all federal income tax adjustments are filed.  As of

December 31, 2019

, there were no state income tax audits in progress that would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. As a result of the implementation of the TCJA, we remeasured deferred taxes and recognized

$

161.1

million

of income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The result of this remeasurement was a reduction in the net deferred tax liability of approximately

$

1.3

billion

, including approximately

$

0.4

billion

of regulatory "gross up" to account for over collection of past taxes from customers.  Offsetting the reduction in net deferred tax liabilities was an increase in regulatory liabilities of approximately

$

1.5

billion

as of December 31, 2017.  In 2018, we received regulatory orders on the treatment of excess deferred taxes from the jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result of these orders, we reduced our regulatory liability related to excess deferred income taxes by

$

120.7

million

(net of tax).  This adjustment is reflected in "Income Taxes" on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2018.

As of December 31, 2019, we received approval from regulators to return excess deferred taxes in all of our jurisdictions in accordance with regulatory proceedings.

On December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ("SAB 118"), which provides guidance on accounting for tax effects of the TCJA. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the TCJA enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740.  There were no adjustments recorded in the SAB 118 remeasurement period in 2018.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

We provide defined contribution plans and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans that cover certain of our employees. Benefits under the defined benefit retirement plans reflect the employees’ compensation, years of service and age at retirement. Additionally, we provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. The majority of employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement age while working for us. The expected cost of such benefits is accrued during the employees’ years of service. Current rates of rate-regulated companies include postretirement benefit costs, including amortization of the regulatory assets that arose prior to inclusion of these costs in rates. For most plans, cash contributions are remitted to grantor trusts.

Our Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans’ Asset Management

. We employ a liability-driven investing strategy for the pension plan, as noted below. A mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets and hedge the liabilities at a prudent level of risk. We utilize a total return investment approach for the other postretirement benefit plans. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and asset class volatility. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as well as growth, value, small and large capitalizations. Other assets such as private equity funds are used judiciously to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification. Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying assets. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability studies.

We utilize a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing in determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are analyzed to ensure that they are consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate greater return over the long run. Current market factors, such as inflation and interest rates, are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

The most important component of an investment strategy is the portfolio asset mix, or the allocation between the various classes of securities available to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans for investment purposes. The asset mix and acceptable minimum and maximum ranges established for our plan assets represents a long-term view and are listed in the table below.

In 2012, a dynamic asset allocation policy for the pension fund was approved.  This policy calls for a gradual reduction in the allocation of return-seeking assets (equities, real estate and private equity) and a corresponding increase in the allocation of liability-hedging assets (fixed income) as the funded status of the plans increase above 90% (as measured by the market value of qualified pension plan assets divided by the projected benefit obligations of the qualified pension plans). A new asset-liability study was completed in 2018 resulting in a more conservative glide path and an increase in the allocation to liability-hedging assets held in the portfolio.

As of

December 31, 2019

, the asset mix and acceptable minimum and maximum ranges established by the policy for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are as follows:

Fair Value Measurements.

The following table sets forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Master Trust and other postretirement benefits investment assets at fair value as of

and


, respectively.

Valuation Techniques Used to Determine Fair Value:

Level 1 Measurements

Most common and preferred stocks are traded in active markets on national and international securities exchanges and are valued at closing prices on the last business day of each period presented. Cash is stated at cost which approximates fair value, with the exception of cash held in foreign currencies which fluctuates with changes in the exchange rates. Short-term bills and notes are priced based on quoted market values.

Level 2 Measurements

Most U.S. Government Agency obligations, mortgage/asset-backed securities, and corporate fixed income securities are generally valued by benchmarking model-derived prices to quoted market prices and trade data for identical or comparable securities. To the extent that quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined based on a valuation model that includes inputs such as interest rate yield curves and credit spreads. Securities traded in markets that are not considered active are valued based on quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.  Other fixed income includes futures and options which are priced on bid valuation or settlement pricing.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Level 3 Measurements

Investments with unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities are classified as level 3 investments.

Not Classified

Commingled funds, private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships hold underlying investments that have prices derived from quoted prices in active markets and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. Instead, these assets are measured at estimated fair value using the net asset value per share of the investments. Commingled funds' underlying assets are principally marketable equity and fixed income securities. Units held in commingled funds are valued at the unit value as reported by the investment managers. Private equity and real estate funds invest in natural resources, commercial real estate and distressed real estate.  The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to the funds’ underlying assets.

For the year ended

The following table provides the key assumptions that were used to calculate the net periodic benefits cost for our various plans:

(1)

In January 2017, we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. This change, compared to the previous method, resulted in a decrease in the actuarially-determined service and interest cost components. Historically, we estimated service and interest cost utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. For fiscal 2017 and beyond, we now utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.

We believe it is appropriate to assume a

6.10

%

and

5.83

%

rate of return on pension and other postretirement plan assets, respectively, for our calculation of

24,964,163

shares of

$

0.01

par value common stock at a price of

$

shares of

5.650

%

Series A Fixed-Rate Reset Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred Stock") at a price of

$

393.9

million

of net proceeds, after deducting commissions and sale expenses. The Series A Preferred Stock was issued in a private placement pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. On December 13, 2018, we filed a registration statement with the SEC enabling holders to exchange their unregistered shares of Series A Preferred Stock for publicly registered shares with substantially identical terms.

Proceeds from the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock were used to pay a portion of the notes tendered in June 2018 and the redemption of the remaining notes in July 2018. See Note

In addition, we issued

20,000

shares of “Series B-1 Preferred Stock”, par value

$

0.01

per share, (“Series B-1 Preferred Stock”), as a distribution with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock. As a result, each of the depositary shares issued on December 5, 2018 now represents a 1/1,000th ownership interest in a share of Series B Preferred Stock and a 1/1,000th ownership interest in a share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock. We issued the Series B-1 Preferred Stock to enhance the voting rights of the Series B Preferred Stock to comply with the minimum voting rights policy of the New York Stock Exchange. The Series B-1 Preferred Stock is paired with the Series B Preferred Stock and may not be transferred, redeemed or repurchased except in connection with the simultaneous transfer, redemption or repurchase of a like number of shares of the underlying Series B Preferred Stock.

Holders of Series B Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights, except for limited voting rights with respect to (i) potential amendments to our certificate of incorporation that would have a material adverse effect on the existing preferences, rights, powers or duties of the Series B Preferred Stock, (ii) the creation or issuance of any security ranking on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock if the cumulative dividends payable on then outstanding Series B Preferred Stock are in arrears, or (iii) the creation or issuance of any security ranking senior to the Series B Preferred Stock. In addition, if and whenever dividends on any shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall not have been declared and paid for at least six dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors then constituting our Board of Directors shall automatically be increased by two until all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full, and the holders of Series B-1 Preferred Stock, voting as a class together with the holders of any outstanding securities ranking on a parity with the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and having like voting rights that are exercisable at the time and entitled to vote thereon, shall be entitled to elect the two additional directors. The Series B Preferred Stock does not have a stated maturity and is not subject to mandatory redemption or any sinking fund. The Series B Preferred Stock will remain outstanding indefinitely unless repurchased or redeemed by us.

Share-Based Compensation

Our stockholders most recently approved the NiSource Inc. 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan (“Omnibus Plan”) at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 12, 2015. The Omnibus Plan provides for awards to employees and non-employee directors of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards and other stock-based awards and supersedes the long-term incentive plan approved by stockholders on April 13, 1994 (“1994 Plan”) and the Director Stock Incentive Plan (“Director Plan”). The Omnibus Plan provides that the number of shares of common stock of NiSource available for awards is

8,000,000

plus the number of shares subject to outstanding awards that expire or terminate for any reason that were granted under either the 1994 Plan or the Director Plan, plus the number of shares that were awarded as a result of the Separation-related adjustments.  At

December 31, 2019

, there were

3,313,183

shares reserved for future awards under the Omnibus Plan.

We recognized stock-based employee compensation expense of

$

16.3

million

,

$

15.2

million

and

$

15.3

million

, during


,


and


, respectively, as well as related tax benefits of

$

0.8

million

,

$

1.0

million

and

$

4.4

million

in


,


and


, respectively.

As of

December 31, 2019

, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards amounted to

$

19.5

million

, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of

1.8

years.

Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock

. In


, we granted

166,031

restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock to employees, subject to service conditions. The total grant date fair value of the restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock was

$

4.1

million

, based on the average market price of our common stock at the date of each grant less the present value of any dividends not received during the vesting period, which will be expensed over the vesting period which is generally

three years

. As of

December 31, 2019

,

157,786

non-vested restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock granted in


were outstanding as of

December 31, 2019

.

In


, we granted

158,689

restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock to employees, subject to service conditions. The total grant date fair value of the restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock was

non-vested restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock granted in

Restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock granted to employees in 2017 were immaterial.

If an employee terminates employment before the service conditions lapse under the


,


or


awards due to (1) retirement or disability (as defined in the award agreement), or (2) death, the service conditions will lapse on the date of such termination with respect to a pro rata portion of the restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock based upon the percentage of the service period satisfied between the grant date and the date of the termination of employment. In the event of a change in  control (as defined in the award agreement), all unvested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded will immediately vest upon termination of employment occurring in connection with a change in control. Termination due to any other reason will result in all unvested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded being forfeited effective on the employee’s date of termination.

Performance Shares

. In

552,389

performance shares subject to service, performance and market conditions. The service conditions for these awards lapse on February 28, 2022. The performance period for the awards is the period beginning January 1, 2019 and ending December 31, 2021. The performance conditions are based on the achievement of one non-GAAP financial measure and additional operational measures as outlined below.

The financial measure is cumulative net operating earnings per share ("NOEPS"), which we define as income from continuing operations adjusted for certain unusual or non-recurring items. The number of cumulative NOEPS shares determined using this measure shall be increased or decreased based on our relative total shareholder return, a market condition which we define as the annualized growth in dividends and share price of a share of our common stock (calculated using a


trading day average of our closing price beginning on December 31, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2021) compared to the total shareholder return of a predetermined peer group of companies. A relative shareholder return result within the first quartile will result in an increase to the NOEPS shares of


%

, while a relative shareholder return result within the fourth quartile will result in a decrease of


%

. A Monte Carlo analysis was used to value the portion of these awards dependent on market conditions. The grant date fair value of the awards was

$

11.7

million

, based on the average market price of our common stock at the date of each grant less the present value of dividends not received during the vesting period which will be expensed over the requisite service period of

three years

. As of

December 31, 2019

,

422,825

of these non-vested performance shares granted in


remained outstanding.

If a threshold level of cumulative NOEPS financial performance is achieved, additional operational measures which we refer to as the customer value index, which consists of

five

equally weighted areas of focus including safety, customer satisfaction, financial, culture and environmental apply. Each area of focus represents

20%

of the customer value index shares, and the targets for all areas must be met for these awards to be eligible for

100%

payout of these awards. The grant date fair value of the awards was

Non-employee Director Awards

. As of May 11, 2010, awards to non-employee directors may be made only under the Omnibus Plan. Currently, restricted stock units are granted annually to non-employee directors, subject to a non-employee director’s election to defer receipt of such restricted stock unit award. The non-employee director’s annual award of restricted stock units vest on the first anniversary of the grant date subject to special pro-rata vesting rules in the event of retirement or disability (as defined in the award agreement), or death. The vested restricted stock units are payable as soon as practicable following vesting except as otherwise provided pursuant to the non-employee director’s election to defer. Certain restricted stock units remain outstanding from the Director Plan. All such awards are fully vested and shall be distributed to the directors upon their separation from the Board.

As of

December 31, 2019

165,768

restricted stock units are outstanding to non-employee directors under either the Omnibus Plan or the Director Plan. Of this amount,

49,926

restricted stock units are unvested and expected to vest.

Leases

ASC 842 Adoption.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842). ASU 2016-02 introduces a lessee model that brings most leases onto the balance sheet. The standard requires that lessees recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases, as that term is defined in the standard) at the lease commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. In 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-01, Leases (ASC 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to ASC 842, which allows us to not evaluate existing land easements under ASC 842, and ASU 2018-11, Leases (ASC 842): Targeted Improvements, which allows calendar year entities to initially apply ASC 842 prospectively from January 1, 2019.

We adopted the provisions of ASC 842 beginning on January 1, 2019, using the transition method provided in ASU 2018-11, which was applied to all existing leases at that date. As such, results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 will be presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts will continue to be reported in accordance with ASC 840. We elected a number of practical expedients, including the "practical expedient package" described in ASC 842-10-65-1 and the provisions of ASU 2018-01, which allows us to not evaluate existing land easements under ASC 842. Further, ASC 842 provides lessees the option of electing an accounting policy, by class of underlying asset, in which the lessee may choose not to separate nonlease components from lease components. We elected this practical expedient for our leases of fleet vehicles, IT assets and railcars. We elected to use a practical expedient that allows the use of hindsight in determining lease terms when evaluating leases that existed at the implementation date. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption, allowing us to not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for all leases that qualify.

Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of additional lease liabilities and corresponding ROU assets of

$

57.0

million

on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2019. The standard had no material impact on our Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss) or our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.

Lease Descriptions.

We are the lessee for substantially all of our leasing activity, which includes operating and finance leases for corporate and field offices, railcars, fleet vehicles and certain IT assets. Our corporate and field office leases have remaining lease terms between


and


years

with options to renew the leases for up to


years

. We lease railcars to transport coal to and from our electric generation facilities in Indiana. Our railcars are specifically identified in the lease agreements and have lease terms between


and


years

with options to renew for


year

. Our fleet vehicles include trucks, trailers and equipment that have been customized specifically for use in the utility industry. We lease fleet vehicles on


year

terms, after which we have the option to extend on a month-to-month basis or terminate with written notice. ROU assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets  do not include obligations for possible fleet vehicle lease renewals beyond the initial lease term. While we have the ability to renew these leases beyond the initial term, we are not reasonably certain (as that term is defined in ASC 842) to do so. We lease the majority of our IT assets under


year lease terms. Ownership of leased IT assets is transferred to us at the end of the lease term.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

We have not provided material residual value guarantees for our leases, nor do our leases contain material restrictions or covenants. Lease contracts containing renewal and termination options are mostly exercisable at our sole discretion. Certain of our real estate and railcar leases include renewal periods in the measurement of the lease obligation if we have deemed the renewals reasonably certain to be exercised.

With respect to service contracts involving the use of assets, if we have the right to direct the use of the asset and obtain substantially all economic benefits from the use of an asset, we account for the service contract as a lease. Unless specifically provided to us by the lessor, we utilize NiSource's collateralized incremental borrowing rate commensurate to the lease term as the discount rate for all of our leases.

Lease costs for the year ended

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Risk management assets and liabilities include interest rate swaps, exchange-traded NYMEX futures and NYMEX options and non-exchange-based forward purchase contracts. When utilized, exchange-traded derivative contracts are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore, nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non-exchange-traded derivatives are valued using broker or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges. In such cases, these non-exchange-traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non-exchange-based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. We use a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs, (i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means). Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized within Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized within Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange-traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, there were

no

material transfers between fair value hierarchies. Additionally, there were no changes in the method or significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our financial instruments.

We have entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk on coupon payments of forecasted issuances of long-term debt. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of each agreement. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the hedges are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps and we can settle the contracts at any time. For additional information, see Note


, "Risk Management Activities."

NIPSCO has entered into long-term forward natural gas purchase instruments that range from five to ten years to lock in a fixed price for its natural gas customers. We value these contracts using a pricing model that incorporates market-based information when available, as these instruments trade less frequently and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Available-for-sale securities are investments pledged as collateral for trust accounts related to our wholly-owned insurance company. Available-for-sale securities are included within “Other investments” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We value U.S. Treasury, corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities using a matrix pricing model that incorporates market-based information. These securities trade less frequently and are classified within Level 2. Total unrealized gains and losses from available-for-sale securities are included in other comprehensive income.

for franchise rights, in each case related to Columbia of Massachusetts. For additional information, see Note


, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

B.         Other Fair Value Disclosures for Financial Instruments

. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, notes receivable, customer deposits and short-term borrowings is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature. Our long-term borrowings are recorded at historical amounts.

The following method and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments.

Long-term debt

. The fair value of outstanding long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar securities. Certain premium costs associated with the early settlement of long-term debt are not taken into consideration in determining fair value. These fair value measurements are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For the years ended

Transfers of Financial Assets

Columbia of Ohio, NIPSCO and Columbia of Pennsylvania each maintain a receivables agreement whereby they transfer their customer accounts receivables to third party financial institutions through wholly-owned and consolidated special purpose entities. The three agreements expire between May 2020 and October 2020 and may be further extended if mutually agreed to by the parties thereto.

All receivables transferred to third parties are valued at face value, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The amount of the undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivables transferred is determined in part by required loss reserves under the agreements.

Transfers of accounts receivable are accounted for as secured borrowings resulting in the recognition of short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As of

Our purchase obligations are for the purchase of physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. Our service agreements encompass a broad range of business support and maintenance functions which are generally described below.

Our subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent minimum quantities of these commodities we are obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. To the extent contractual purchase prices are variable, obligations disclosed in the table above are valued at market prices as of

MW of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity generation from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by NIPSCO for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), NIPSCO may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination.

C.         Legal Proceedings

.

On September 13, 2018, a series of fires and explosions occurred in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, Massachusetts related to the delivery of natural gas by Columbia of Massachusetts (the "Greater Lawrence Incident"). The Greater Lawrence Incident resulted in one fatality and a number of injuries, damaged multiple homes and businesses, and caused the temporary evacuation of significant portions of each municipality. The Massachusetts Governor’s Office declared a state of emergency, authorizing the Massachusetts DPU to order another utility company to coordinate the restoration of utility services in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover.  The incident resulted in the interruption of gas for approximately

7,500

gas meters, the majority of which served residences and approximately


of which served businesses, and the interruption of other utility service more broadly in the area. Columbia of Massachusetts has replaced the cast iron and bare steel gas pipeline system in the affected area and restored service to nearly all of the gas meters. See “ - E. Other Matters - Greater Lawrence Pipeline Replacement” below for more information.

We are subject to inquiries and investigations by government authorities and regulatory agencies regarding the Greater Lawrence Incident, including the Massachusetts DPU and the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, as described below. We are cooperating with all inquiries and investigations.  In addition, on February 26, 2020, the Company and Columbia of Massachusetts entered into agreements with the U.S. Attorney’s Office to resolve the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s investigation relating to the Greater Lawrence Incident, as described below.

NTSB Investigation

. As previously disclosed, the NTSB concluded its investigation into the Greater Lawrence Incident, and we are implementing the

one

remaining safety recommendation resulting from the investigation.

Massachusetts Investigations.

Under Massachusetts law, the DPU is authorized to investigate potential violations of pipeline safety regulations and to assess a civil penalty of up to

$

218,647

for a violation of federal pipeline safety regulations. A separate violation occurs for each day of violation up to

$

2.2

million

for a related series of violations. The Massachusetts DPU also is authorized to investigate potential violations of the Columbia of Massachusetts emergency response plan and to assess penalties of up to

$

250,000

per violation per day, or up to

$


million

per related series of violations. Further, as a result of the declaration of emergency by the Governor, the DPU is authorized to investigate potential violations of the DPU's operational directives during the restoration efforts and assess penalties of up to

$


million

per violation. Pursuant to these authorities, the DPU is investigating Columbia of Massachusetts as described below. Columbia of Massachusetts will likely be subject to potential compliance actions related to the Greater Lawrence Incident and the restoration work following the incident, the timing and outcomes of which are uncertain at this time.

After the Greater Lawrence Incident, the Massachusetts DPU retained an independent evaluator to conduct a statewide examination of the safety of the natural gas distribution system and the operational and maintenance functions of natural gas companies in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Through authority granted by the Massachusetts Governor under the state of emergency, the Chair of the Massachusetts DPU has directed all natural gas distribution companies operating in the Commonwealth to fund the statewide examination. The statewide examination is complete. The Phase I report, which was issued in May 2019, included a program level assessment and evaluation of natural gas distribution companies. The Phase I report's conclusions were statewide and contained no specific conclusions about Columbia of Massachusetts. Phase II, which was focused on field assessments of each Massachusetts gas company, concluded in December 2019. The Phase II report made several observations about and recommendations to Massachusetts gas companies, including Columbia of Massachusetts, with regard to safety culture and assets.  The final report was issued in late January 2020, and the DPU directed each natural gas distribution company operating in Massachusetts to submit a plan in response to the report no later than February 28, 2020.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

On September 11, 2019, the Massachusetts DPU issued an order directing Columbia of Massachusetts to take several specific actions to address concerns related to service lines abandoned during the restoration work following the Greater Lawrence Incident and to furnish certain information and periodic reports to the DPU.

On October 1, 2019, the Massachusetts DPU issued four orders to Columbia of Massachusetts in connection with the service lines abandoned during the Greater Lawrence Incident restoration, which require: (1) the submission of a detailed work plan to the DPU, (2) the completion of quality control work on certain abandoned services, (3) the payment for a third-party independent audit, to be contracted through the DPU, of all gas pipeline work completed as part of the incident restoration effort, and (4) prompt and full response to any requests for information by the third-party auditor. The Massachusetts DPU retained an independent evaluator to conduct this audit, and that third party is currently evaluating compliance with Massachusetts and federal law, as well as any other operational or safety risks that may be posed by the pipeline work. The audit scope also includes Columbia of Massachusetts' operations in the Lawrence Division and other service territories as appropriate.

Also in October 2019, the Massachusetts DPU issued three additional orders requiring: (1) daily leak surveillance and reporting in areas where abandoned services are located, (2) completion by November 15, 2019 of the work plan previously submitted describing how Columbia of Massachusetts would address the estimated

2,200

locations at which an inside meter set was moved outside the property as part of the abandoned service work completed during the Greater Lawrence Incident restoration, and (3) submission of a report by December 2, 2019 showing any patterns, trends or correlations among the non-compliant work related to the abandonment of service lines, gate boxes and curb boxes during the incident restoration.

On October 3, 2019, the Massachusetts DPU notified Columbia of Massachusetts that, absent DPU approval, it is currently allowed to perform only emergency work on its gas distribution system throughout its service territories in Massachusetts. The restrictions do not apply to Columbia of Massachusetts’ work to address the previously identified issues with abandoned service lines and valve boxes in the Greater Lawrence, Massachusetts area. Columbia of Massachusetts is subject to daily monitoring by the DPU on any work that Columbia of Massachusetts conducts in Massachusetts.  Such restrictions on work remain in place until modified by the DPU.

On October 25, 2019, the Massachusetts DPU issued two orders opening public investigations into Columbia of Massachusetts with respect to the Greater Lawrence Incident. The Massachusetts DPU opened the first investigation under its authority to determine compliance with federal and state pipeline safety laws and regulations, and to investigate Columbia of Massachusetts’ responsibility for and response to the Greater Lawrence Incident and its restoration efforts following the incident. The Massachusetts DPU opened the second investigation under its authority to determine whether a gas distribution company has violated established standards regarding acceptable performance for emergency preparedness and restoration of service to investigate efforts by Columbia of Massachusetts to prepare for and restore service following the Greater Lawrence Incident. Separate penalties are applicable under each exercise of authority.

On December 23, 2019, the Massachusetts DPU issued an order defining the scope of its investigation into the response of Columbia of Massachusetts related to the Greater Lawrence Incident. The DPU identified three distinct time frames in which Columbia of Massachusetts handled emergency response and restoration directly: (1) September 13-14, 2018, (2) September 21 through December 16, 2018 (the Phase I restoration), and (3) September 27, 2019 through completion of restoration of outages resulting from the gas release event in Lawrence, Massachusetts that occurred on September 27, 2019.  The DPU determined that it is appropriate to investigate separately, for each time period described above, the areas of response, recovery and restoration for which Columbia of Massachusetts was responsible. The DPU noted that it also may investigate the continued restoration and related repair work that took place after December 16, 2018 and, depending on the outcome of that investigation, may deem it appropriate to consider that period of restoration as an additional separate time period.

The DPU also noted that its investigation into all of the above described time periods is ongoing and that if the DPU determines, based on its investigation, that it is appropriate to treat the separate time frames as separate emergency events, it may impose up to the maximum statutory penalty for each event, pursuant to Mass. G.L. c. 164 Section 1J. This provision authorizes the DPU to investigate potential violations of the Columbia of Massachusetts emergency response plan and to assess penalties of up to

$

250,000

per violation per day, or up to

$


million

per related series of violations.  The DPU noted that at this preliminary stage of the investigation, it does not have the factual basis to make those determinations.

In connection with its investigation related to the Greater Lawrence Incident, on February 4, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office issued a request for documents primarily focused on the restoration work following the incident.

Columbia of Massachusetts is cooperating with the investigations set forth above as well as other inquiries resulting from an increased amount of enforcement activity, for all of which the outcomes are uncertain at this time.

Massachusetts Legislative Matters

. On November 12, 2019, the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy held a hearing that focused on gas safety, but the Committee has not taken action on any bills. Increased scrutiny related to gas system safety and regulatory oversight in Massachusetts, including additional legislative oversight hearings and new legislative proposals, is expected to continue during the current two-year legislative session that ends in December 2020.

U.S. Department of Justice Investigation.

As previously disclosed, the Company and Columbia of Massachusetts are subject to a criminal investigation related to the Greater Lawrence Incident that is being conducted under the supervision of the U.S. Attorney's Office. The initial grand jury subpoenas were served on the Company and Columbia of Massachusetts on September 24, 2018.

On February 26, 2020, the Company and Columbia of Massachusetts entered into agreements with the U.S. Attorney’s Office to resolve the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s investigation relating to the Greater Lawrence Incident.  Columbia of Massachusetts agreed to plead guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (the “Court”) to violating the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act (the “Plea Agreement”), and the Company entered into a DPA.

Under the Plea Agreement, which must be approved by the Court, Columbia of Massachusetts will be subject to the following terms, among others: (i) a criminal fine in the amount of $53,030,116 paid within 30 days of sentencing; (ii) a three year probationary period that will early terminate upon a sale of Columbia of Massachusetts or a sale of its gas distribution business to a qualified third-party buyer consistent with certain requirements; (iii) compliance with each of the NTSB recommendations stemming from  the Greater Lawrence Incident; and (iv) employment of an in-house monitor during the term of the probationary period.

Under the DPA, the U.S. Attorney’s Office agreed to defer prosecution of the Company in connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident for a three-year period (which three-year period may be extended for twelve (12) months upon the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s determination of a breach of the DPA) subject to certain obligations of the Company, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) the Company will use reasonable best efforts to sell Columbia of Massachusetts or Columbia of Massachusetts’ gas distribution business to a qualified third-party buyer consistent with certain requirements, and, upon the completion of any such sale, the Company will cease and desist any and all gas pipeline and distribution activities in the District of Massachusetts; (ii) the Company will forfeit and pay, within 30 days of the later of the sale becoming final or the date on which post-closing adjustments to the purchase price are finally determined in accordance with the agreement to sell Columbia Gas of Massachusetts or its gas distribution business,  a fine equal to the total amount of any profit or gain from any sale of Columbia of Massachusetts or its gas distribution business, with the amount of profit or gain determined as provided in the DPA; and (iii) the Company agrees as to each of the Company’s subsidiaries involved in the distribution of gas through pipeline facilities in Massachusetts, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Kentucky and Virginia to implement and adhere to each of the recommendations from the NTSB stemming from the Greater Lawrence Incident.  Pursuant to the DPA, if the Company complies with all of its obligations under the DPA, including, but not limited to those identified above, the U.S. Attorney’s Office will not file any criminal charges against the Company related to the Greater Lawrence Incident. If Columbia of Massachusetts’ guilty plea is not accepted by the Court or is withdrawn for any reason, or if Columbia of Massachusetts should fail to perform an obligation under the Plea Agreement prior to the sale of Columbia of Massachusetts or its gas distribution business, the U.S. Attorney's Office may, at its sole option, render the DPA null and void.

U.S. Congressional Activity.

On September 30, 2019, the U.S. Pipeline Safety Act expired. There is no effect on PHMSA's authority. Action on past re-authorization bills has extended past the expiration date and action on this re-authorization is expected to continue well into 2020. Pipeline safety jurisdiction resides with the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, and is divided between two committees in the U.S. House of Representatives (Energy and Commerce, and Transportation and Infrastructure). Legislative proposals are currently in various stages of committee development and the timing of further action is uncertain. Certain legislative proposals, if enacted into law, may increase costs for natural gas industry companies, including the Company and Columbia of Massachusetts.

SEC Investigation.

On November 27, 2019, the SEC staff notified the Company that it concluded its investigation related to disclosures made by the Company prior to the Greater Lawrence Incident and, based on the information provided as of such date, it does not intend to recommend an enforcement action against the Company.

Private Actions.

Various lawsuits, including several purported class action lawsuits, have been filed by various affected residents or businesses in Massachusetts state courts against the Company and/or Columbia of Massachusetts in connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident. A special judge has been appointed to hear all pending and future cases and the class actions have been consolidated into one class action. On January 14, 2019, the special judge granted the parties’ joint motion to stay all cases until

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

April 30, 2019 to allow mediation, and the parties subsequently agreed to extend the stay until July 25, 2019. The class action lawsuits allege varying causes of action, including those for strict liability for ultra-hazardous activity, negligence, private nuisance, public nuisance, premises liability, trespass, breach of warranty, breach of contract, failure to warn, unjust enrichment, consumer protection act claims, negligent, reckless and intentional infliction of emotional distress and gross negligence, and seek actual compensatory damages, plus treble damages, and punitive damages.

On July 26, 2019, the Company, Columbia of Massachusetts and NiSource Corporate Services Company, a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a term sheet with the class action plaintiffs under which they agreed to settle the class action claims in connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident. Columbia of Massachusetts agreed to pay

$


million

into a settlement fund to compensate the settlement class and the settlement class agreed to release Columbia of Massachusetts and affiliates from all claims arising out of or related to the Greater Lawrence Incident. The following claims are not covered under the proposed settlement because they are not part of the consolidated class action: (1) physical bodily injury and wrongful death; (2) insurance subrogation, whether equitable, contractual or otherwise; and (3) claims arising out of appliances that are subject to the Massachusetts DPU orders. Emotional distress and similar claims are covered under the proposed settlement unless they are secondary to a physical bodily injury. The settlement class is defined under the term sheet as all persons and businesses in the three municipalities of Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, Massachusetts, subject to certain limited exceptions. The motion for preliminary approval and the settlement documents were filed on September 25, 2019. The preliminary approval court hearing was held on October 7, 2019 and the court issued an order granting preliminary approval of the settlement on October 11, 2019. The proposed settlement is subject to final court approval, and a hearing occurred on February 27, 2020. The court took the matter under advisement.

Many residents and business owners have submitted individual damage claims to Columbia of Massachusetts. Most of the wrongful death and bodily injury claims that have been asserted have been settled, and we continue to discuss potential settlements with plaintiffs asserting such claims. In addition, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is seeking reimbursement from Columbia of Massachusetts for its expenses incurred in connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident.  The outcomes and impacts of such private actions are uncertain at this time.

Financial Impact.

Since the Greater Lawrence Incident, we have recorded expenses of approximately

$

1,041

million

for third-party claims and fines, penalties and settlements associated with government investigations. We estimate that total costs related to third-party claims and fines, penalties and settlements associated with  government investigations resulting from the incident will range from

$

1,041

million

to

$

1,065

million

, depending on the number, nature, final outcome and value of third-party claims and the final outcome of government investigations. With regard to third-party claims, these costs include, but are not limited to, personal injury and property damage claims, damage to infrastructure, business interruption claims, and mutual aid payments to other utilities assisting with the restoration effort. These costs do not include costs of certain third-party claims and fines, penalties or settlements associated with government investigations that we are not able to estimate, nor do they include non-claims related and government investigation-related legal expenses resulting from the incident and the capital cost of the pipeline replacement, which are set forth in  " - E. Other Matters - Greater Lawrence Incident Restoration" and "- Greater Lawrence Incident Pipeline Replacement," respectively, below.

The process for estimating costs associated with third-party claims and fines, penalties, and settlements associated with government investigations relating to the Greater Lawrence Incident requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors. As more information becomes known, including additional information regarding ongoing investigations, management’s estimates and assumptions regarding the financial impact of the Greater Lawrence Incident may change.

The aggregate amount of third-party liability insurance coverage available for losses arising from the Greater Lawrence Incident is

$


million

. We have collected the entire

$


million

as of December 31, 2019. Total expenses related to the incident have exceeded the total amount of insurance coverage available under our policies. Refer to "- E. Other Matters - Greater Lawrence Incident Restoration," below for a summary of third-party claims-related expense activity and associated insurance recoveries recorded since the Greater Lawrence Incident.

We are also party to certain other claims, regulatory and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business in each state in which we have operations, none of which is deemed to be individually material at this time.

Due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim, proceeding or investigation related to the Greater Lawrence Incident or otherwise would not have a material adverse effect on our results of

OURCE

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

operations, financial position or liquidity. Certain matters in connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident have had or may have a material impact as described above. If one or more of such additional or other matters were decided against us, the effects could be material to our results of operations in the period in which we would be required to record or adjust the related liability and could also be material to our cash flows in the periods that we would be required to pay such liability.

D.        Environmental Matters

.

Our operations are subject to environmental statutes and regulations related to air quality, water quality, hazardous waste and solid waste. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the environmental regulations currently applicable to our operations.

It is management's continued intent to address environmental issues in cooperation with regulatory authorities in such a manner as to achieve mutually acceptable compliance plans. However, there can be no assurance that fines and penalties will not be incurred. Management expects a significant portion of environmental assessment, improvement and remediation costs to be recoverable through rates for certain of our companies.

As of

December 31, 2019

and


, we had recorded a liability of

$

104.4

million

and

$

101.2

million

, respectively, to cover environmental remediation at various sites. The current portion of this liability is included in "Legal and environmental" in the  Consolidated Balance Sheets. The noncurrent portion is included in "Other noncurrent liabilities." We recognize costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The original estimates for remediation activities may differ materially from the amount ultimately expended. The actual future expenditures depend on many factors, including currently enacted laws and regulations, the nature and extent of impact and the method of remediation. These expenditures are not currently estimable at some sites. We periodically adjust our liability as information is collected and estimates become more refined.

Electric Operations' compliance estimates disclosed below are reflective of NIPSCO's Integrated Resource Plan submitted to the IURC on October 31, 2018. See section " - E. Other Matters - NIPSCO 2018 Integrated Resource Plan," below for additional information.

Air

Future legislative and regulatory programs could significantly limit allowed GHG emissions or impose a cost or tax on GHG emissions. Additionally, rules that require further GHG reductions or impose additional requirements for natural gas facilities could impose additional costs. NiSource will carefully monitor all GHG reduction proposals and regulations.

ACE Rule.

On July 8, 2019, the EPA published the final ACE rule, which establishes emission guidelines for states to use when developing plans to limit carbon dioxide at coal-fired electric generating units based on heat rate improvement measures. The coal-fired units at NIPSCO’s R.M. Schahfer Generating Station and Michigan City Generating Station are potentially affected sources, and compliance requirements for these units which NIPSCO plans to retire by 2023 and 2028, respectively, will be determined by future Indiana rulemaking. The ACE rule notes that states have “broad flexibility in setting standards of performance for designated facilities” and that a state may set a “business as usual” standard for sources that have a remaining useful life “so short that imposing any costs on the electric generating unit is unreasonable.” State plans are due by 2022, and the EPA will have six months to determine completeness and then one additional year to determine whether to approve the submitted plan. States have the discretion to determine the compliance period for each source. As a result, NIPSCO will continue to monitor this matter and cannot estimate its impact at this time.

Waste

CERCLA.

Our subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties at waste disposal sites under the CERCLA (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws. Under CERCLA, each potentially responsible party can be held jointly, severally and strictly liable for the remediation costs as the EPA, or state, can allow the parties to pay for remedial action or perform remedial action themselves and request reimbursement from the potentially responsible parties. Our affiliates have retained CERCLA environmental liabilities, including remediation liabilities, associated with certain current and former operations. These liabilities are not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

MGP.

A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries or predecessors may have liability. The program has identified


such sites where liability is probable. Remedial actions at many of these sites are being overseen by state or federal environmental agencies through consent agreements or voluntary remediation agreements.

We utilize a probabilistic model to estimate our future remediation costs related to MGP sites. The model was prepared with the assistance of a third party and incorporates our experience and general industry experience with remediating MGP sites. We

complete an annual refresh of the model in the second quarter of each fiscal year. No material changes to the estimated future remediation costs were noted as a result of the refresh completed as of June 30, 2019. Our total estimated liability related to the facilities subject to remediation was

$

102.2

million

and

$

97.5

million

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. The liability represents our best estimate of the probable cost to remediate the facilities. We believe that it is reasonably possible that remediation costs could vary by as much as

$


million

in addition to the costs noted above. Remediation costs are estimated based on the best available information, applicable remediation standards at the balance sheet date, and experience with similar facilities.

CCRs.

On April 17, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule for regulation of CCRs. The rule regulates CCRs under the RCRA Subtitle D, which determines them to be nonhazardous. The rule is implemented in phases and requires increased groundwater monitoring, reporting, recordkeeping and posting of related information to the Internet. The rule also establishes requirements related to CCR management and disposal. The rule will allow NIPSCO to continue its byproduct beneficial use program.

To comply with the rule, NIPSCO completed capital expenditures to modify its infrastructure and manage CCRs during 2019. The CCR rule also resulted in revisions to previously recorded legal obligations associated with the retirement of certain NIPSCO facilities. The actual asset retirement costs related to the CCR rule may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the increased asset retirement obligation due to the uncertainty about the requirements that will be established by environmental authorities, compliance strategies that will be used and the preliminary nature of available data used to estimate costs. As allowed by the rule, NIPSCO will continue to collect data over time to determine the specific compliance solutions and associated costs and, as a result, the actual costs may vary. NIPSCO has filed initial CCR closure plans for R.M. Schahfer Generating Station and Michigan City Generating Station with the Indiana Department of Environmental Management.

Water

ELG.

On November 3, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule to amend the ELG and standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating category. Based upon a  study performed in 2016 of the final rule, capital compliance costs were expected to be approximately

$

170.0

million

. The EPA has proposed revisions to the final rule, and public comments were due on January 21, 2020. NIPSCO does not anticipate material ELG compliance costs based on the preferred option announced as part of NIPSCO's 2018 Integrated Resource Plan (discussed below).

E.         Other Matters.

NIPSCO 2018 Integrated Resource Plan.

Multiple factors, but primarily economic ones, including low natural gas prices, advancing cost effective renewable technology and increasing capital and operating costs associated with existing coal plants, have led NIPSCO to conclude in its October 2018 Integrated Resource Plan submission that NIPSCO’s current fleet of coal generation facilities will be retired earlier than previous Integrated Resource Plans had indicated.

The Integrated Resource Plan evaluated demand-side and supply-side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet NIPSCO customers' future energy requirements over the ensuing


years. The preferred option within the Integrated Resource Plan retires R.M. Schahfer Generating Station (Units 14, 15, 17, and 18) by 2023 and Michigan City Generating Station (Unit 12) by 2028. These units represent

2,080

MW of generating capacity, equal to


%

of NIPSCO’s remaining generating capacity (and


%

of NIPSCO's remaining coal-fired generating capacity) after the retirement of Bailly Units 7 and 8 on May 31, 2018.

The current replacement plan includes renewable sources of energy, including wind, solar, and battery storage to be obtained through a combination of NIPSCO ownership and PPAs.

In January 2019, NIPSCO executed

two


year PPAs to purchase


%

of the output from renewable generation facilities at a fixed price per MWh. NIPSCO submitted the PPAs to the IURC for approval in February 2019 and the IURC approved the PPAs on June 5, 2019. Payments under the PPAs will not begin until the associated generation facilities are constructed by the owner / seller which is currently scheduled to be complete by the end of 2020 for one facility. NIPSCO has filed a notice with the IURC of its intention not to move forward with one of its approved PPAs due to the failure to meet a condition precedent in the agreement as a result of local zoning restrictions.

Also in January 2019, NIPSCO executed a BTA with a developer to construct a renewable generation facility with a nameplate capacity of approximately


MW. Once complete, ownership of the facility would be transferred to a joint venture owned by NIPSCO, the developer and an unrelated tax equity partner. The aforementioned joint venture is expected to be fully owned by NIPSCO after the PTC are monetized from the project (approximately


years after the facility goes into service). NIPSCO's purchase requirement under the BTA is dependent on satisfactory approval of the BTA by the IURC, successful execution of an agreement with a tax equity partner, and timely completion of construction. NIPSCO submitted the BTA to the IURC for approval

in February 2019 and the IURC approved the BTA on August 7, 2019. Required FERC filings occurred after receiving the IURC order and the related approvals were received.  Construction of the facility is expected to be completed by the end of 2020.

On October 1, 2019, NIPSCO announced the opening of its next round of RFP to consider potential resources to meet the future electric needs of its customers. The RFP closed on November 20, 2019, and NIPSCO continues to evaluate the results. NIPSCO is considering all sources in the RFP process.

In October 2019, NIPSCO executed a BTA with a developer to construct an additional renewable generation facility with a nameplate capacity of approximately


MW. Once complete, ownership of the facility would be transferred to a joint venture owned by NIPSCO, the developer and an unrelated tax equity partner. The aforementioned joint venture is expected to be fully owned by NIPSCO after the PTC are monetized from the project (approximately


years after the facility goes into service). NIPSCO's purchase requirement under the BTA is dependent on satisfactory approval of the BTA by the IURC, successful execution of an agreement with a tax equity partner, and timely completion of construction. NIPSCO submitted the BTA to the IURC for approval on October 22, 2019, and the IURC approved the BTA on February 19, 2020. Required FERC filings are expected to be filed by the end of June 2020.  Construction of the facility is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.

Greater Lawrence Incident Restoration

. In addition to the amounts estimated for third-party claims and fines, penalties and settlements associated with government investigations described above, since the Greater Lawrence Incident, we have recorded expenses of approximately

$420 million

for other incident-related costs.  We estimate that total other incident-related costs will range from

$


million

to

$


million

, depending on the incurrence of costs associated with resolving outstanding inquiries and investigations discuss above in " - C. Legal Proceedings."  Such costs include certain consulting costs, legal costs, vendor costs, claims center costs, labor and related expenses incurred in connection with the incident, and insurance-related loss surcharges. The amounts set forth above do not include the capital cost of the pipeline replacement, which is set forth below, or any estimates for fines and penalties, which are discussed above in " - C. Legal Proceedings."

As discussed in "- C. Legal Proceedings," the aggregate amount of third-party liability insurance coverage available for losses arising from the Greater Lawrence Incident is

$


million

.  We have collected the entire

$


million

as of December 31, 2019. Expenses related to the incident have exceeded the total amount of insurance coverage available under our policies.

(1)

$5 million

of insurance recoveries were collected during 2018.

Greater Lawrence Pipeline Replacement

. In connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident, Columbia of Massachusetts, in cooperation with the Massachusetts Governor’s office, replaced the entire affected


-mile cast iron and bare steel pipeline system that delivers gas to approximately

7,500

gas meters, the majority of which serve residences and approximately


of which serve businesses impacted in the Greater Lawrence Incident. This system was replaced with plastic distribution mains and service lines, as well as enhanced safety features such as pressure regulation and excess flow valves at each premise.

Since the Greater Lawrence Incident and through December 31, 2019, we have invested approximately

$


million

of capital spend for the pipeline replacement; this work was completed in 2019. We maintain property insurance for gas pipelines and other applicable property. Columbia of Massachusetts has filed a proof of loss with its property insurer for the full cost of the pipeline replacement.  In January 2020, we filed a lawsuit against the property insurer, seeking payment of our property claim.  We are currently unable to predict the timing or amount of any insurance recovery under the property policy. The recovery of any capital investment not reimbursed through insurance will be addressed in a future regulatory proceeding; a future regulatory proceeding is dependent on the outcome of the sale of the Massachusetts Business. The outcome of such a proceeding (if any) is uncertain. In accordance with ASC 980-360, if it becomes probable that a portion of the pipeline replacement cost will not be recoverable through customer rates and an amount can be reasonably estimated, we will reduce our regulated plant balance for the amount of the probable disallowance and record an associated charge to earnings. This could result in a material adverse effect to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, if a rate order is received allowing recovery of the investment with no or reduced return on investment, a loss on disallowance may be required.

State Income Taxes Related to Greater Lawrence Incident Expenses

.  As of December 31, 2018, expenses related to the Greater Lawrence Incident were

$

1,023

million

. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we filed an application for Alternative Apportionment with the MA DOR to request an allocable approach to these expenses for purposes of Massachusetts state income taxes, which, if approved, would result in a state deferred tax asset of approximately

$


million

, net. The MA DOR is expected to review the application within nine months from the date of filing, and we believe it is reasonably possible that the application will be accepted, or an alternative method proposed.

Subsequent Event

On February 26, 2020, NiSource and Columbia of Massachusetts entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement with Eversource. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement, NiSource and Columbia of Massachusetts agreed to sell to Eversource, with certain additions and exceptions: (1) substantially all of the assets of Columbia of Massachusetts and (2) all of the assets held by any of Columbia of Massachusetts’ affiliates that primarily relate to the Massachusetts Business, and Eversource agreed to assume certain liabilities of Columbia of Massachusetts and its affiliates. The liabilities assumed by Eversource under the Asset Purchase Agreement do not include, among others, any liabilities arising out of the Greater Lawrence Incident or liabilities of Columbia of Massachusetts or its affiliates pursuant to civil claims for injury of persons or damage to property to the extent such injury or damage occurs prior to the closing in connection with the Massachusetts Business. The Asset Purchase Agreement provides for a purchase price of

$

1,100

million

in cash, subject to adjustment based on Columbia of Massachusetts’ net working capital as of the closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement is subject to Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and regulatory approvals, resolution of certain proceedings before governmental bodies and other conditions. The Massachusetts Business did not meet the requirements under GAAP to be classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2019. When the Massachusetts Business meets the requirements to be classified as held-for-sale, in each period leading up to the closing date of the transaction, the assets and liabilities of the Massachusetts Business will be measured at fair value, less costs to sell. The final pre-tax gain or loss on the transaction will be determined as of the closing date. Assuming the Massachusetts Business is classified as held-for-sale at March 31, 2020, we estimate that the total pre-tax loss to be measured in the quarter ended March 31, 2020 will be approximately

$


million

, based on December 31, 2019 asset and liability balances and estimated transaction costs. This estimated pre-tax loss is subject to change based on estimated transaction costs, working capital adjustments and asset and liability balances at each measurement date leading up to the closing date.  The sale is expected to close by September 30, 2020, subject to closing conditions.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that financial information was processed, recorded and reported accurately.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. However, management would note that a control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Our management has adopted the 2013 framework set forth in the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission report, Internal Control - Integrated Framework, the most commonly used and understood framework for evaluating internal control over financial reporting, as its framework for evaluating the reliability and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. During 2019, we conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, issued an attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Controls

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of NiSource Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of NiSource Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
