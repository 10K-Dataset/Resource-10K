ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

NiSource Inc.

NiSource is an energy holding company whose subsidiaries provide natural gas, electricity and other
products and services to approximately 3.8 million customers located within a corridor that runs
from the Gulf Coast through the Midwest to New England. NiSource is the successor to an Indiana
corporation organized in 1987 under the name of NIPSCO Industries, Inc., which changed its name to
NiSource Inc. on April 14, 1999. In connection with the acquisition of Columbia on November 1,
2000, NiSource became a Delaware corporation registered under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935. Effective February 8, 2006, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was
repealed. NiSource is now a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005.

NiSource is the largest natural gas distribution company operating east of the Rocky Mountains, as
measured by number of customers. NiSource’s principal subsidiaries include Columbia, a
vertically-integrated natural gas distribution, transmission and storage holding company whose
subsidiaries provide service to customers in the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast;
Northern Indiana, a vertically-integrated gas and electric company providing service to customers
in northern Indiana; and Bay State, a natural gas distribution company serving customers in New
England. NiSource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating
results of its 16 direct subsidiaries.

NiSource’s business segments are: Gas Distribution Operations; Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations; Electric Operations; and Other Operations. During the third quarter of 2003, NiSource
sold its exploration and production operations. Previous to this sale, NiSource reported these
operations in an Exploration and Production Operations segment. In addition, during the fourth
quarter of 2003, NiSource sold certain subsidiaries of PEI (formerly Primary Energy). Previously,
the operations of the PEI subsidiaries were reported in the Other Operations segment. All periods
have been adjusted to reflect the PEI subsidiaries and the Exploration and Production Operations
segment as discontinued operations.

Gas Distribution Operations

NiSource’s natural gas distribution operations serve more than 3.3 million customers in 9 states
and operate approximately 57 thousand miles of pipeline. Through its wholly owned subsidiary,
Columbia, NiSource owns five distribution subsidiaries that provide natural gas to approximately
2.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia,
Kentucky and Maryland. NiSource also distributes natural gas to approximately 789 thousand
customers in northern Indiana through three subsidiaries: Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and
Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Additionally, NiSource’s subsidiaries Bay State and Northern
Utilities distribute natural gas to approximately 338 thousand customers in Massachusetts, Maine
and New Hampshire.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations

NiSource’s Gas Transmission and Storage Operations subsidiaries own and operate approximately 16
thousand miles of interstate pipelines and operate one of the nation’s largest underground natural
gas storage systems capable of storing approximately 646 Bcf of natural gas. Through its
subsidiaries, Columbia Transmission, Columbia Gulf, Crossroads Pipeline and Granite State Gas,
NiSource owns and operates an interstate pipeline network extending from offshore in the Gulf of
Mexico to Lake Erie, New York and the eastern seaboard. Together, these companies serve customers
in 19 northeastern, mid-Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The
Gas Transmission and Storage Operations subsidiaries are engaged in several projects that will
expand their facilities and throughput. The largest such project is the proposed Millennium
Pipeline. The Millennium Pipeline is a project proposed by a partnership of energy companies
including Columbia Transmission, which would replace parts of an existing Columbia Transmission
pipeline. Another project is Hardy Storage, a Columbia Transmission partnership to develop a
storage field in West Virginia to provide additional natural gas storage for the eastern United
States. Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central
and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both
projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East
Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the
central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing
appropriate regulatory applications during 2006.



ITEM 1.

BUSINESS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Electric Operations

NiSource generates and distributes electricity through its subsidiary Northern Indiana to
approximately 450 thousand customers in 21 counties in the northern part of Indiana and engages in
wholesale and transmission transactions. Northern Indiana owns and has the ability to operate four
coal-fired electric generating stations with a net capability of 3,059 mw, six gas-fired generating
units with a net capability of 323 mw and two hydroelectric generating plants with a net capability
of 10 mw. These facilities provide for a total system net capability of 3,392 mw. Northern
Indiana’s transmission system, with voltages from 34,500 to 345,000 volts, consists of 3,184
circuit miles. Northern Indiana is interconnected with five neighboring electric utilities.

Northern Indiana now operates three coal-fired generation stations with a net capacity of 2,574 mw,
six gas-fired generating units with a net capacity of 323 mw and two hydroelectric plants with a
net capability of 10 mw, totaling a net capability of 2,907 mw. During the year ended December 31,
2005, Northern Indiana generated 87.1% and purchased 12.9% of its electric requirements. Northern
Indiana’s Mitchell Station, indefinitely shut down in 2002, is not included in the net capacity
above. Northern Indiana’s generating requirements are currently under review. Northern Indiana’s
Integrated Resource Plan, filed with the IURC in November 2005, indicated a gap between customer
demand projections and company owned generating capability, primarily in peak hours during the
summer. Northern Indiana is also considering capacity requirements associated with its varying
load.

Other Operations

The Other Operations segment participates in energy-related services including gas marketing, power
trading and ventures focused on distributed power generation technologies, including a cogeneration
facility, fuel cells and storage systems. PEI operates the Whiting Clean Energy project at BP’s
Whiting, Indiana refinery, which is a 525 mw cogeneration facility that uses natural gas to produce
electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and also provides steam for industrial use.
Additionally, the Other Operations segment is involved in real estate and other businesses.

Divestiture of Non-Core Assets

In recent years, NiSource sold certain businesses judged to be non-core to NiSource’s strategy. In
2003, NiSource sold CER, Transcom, Columbia Service Partners, and all of the steel-related,
inside-the-fence assets of PEI. Refer to “Discontinued Operations” included in Item 7, and Note 4,
“Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.

Business Strategy

NiSource focuses its business strategy on its core, rate-regulated asset-based businesses with
virtually 100% of its operating income generated from the rate-regulated businesses. With the
nation’s fourth largest natural gas pipeline, the largest natural gas distribution network east of
the Rocky Mountains and one of the nation’s largest natural gas storage networks, NiSource operates
throughout the energy-intensive corridor that extends from the supply areas in the Gulf Coast
through the consumption centers in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, New England and Northeast. This
corridor includes 30% of the nation’s population and 40% of its energy consumption. NiSource
continues to position its assets to meet the corridor’s growing energy needs.

Competition and Changes in the Regulatory Environment

The regulatory frameworks applicable to NiSource’s operations, at both the state and federal
levels, continue to evolve. These changes have had and will continue to have an impact on
NiSource’s operations, structure and profitability. Management continually seeks new ways to be
more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including providing gas customers
with increased choices for products and services, and developing new energy-related products and
services for residential, commercial and industrial customers.



ITEM 1.

BUSINESS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Natural Gas Competition.

Open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the
deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets. LDC
customers and marketers began to purchase gas directly from producers and marketers and an open,
competitive market for gas supplies has emerged. This separation or “unbundling” of the
transportation and other services offered by pipelines and LDC’s allows customers to purchase the
commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and LDC’s. The LDC’s continue to
purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers. NiSource’s Gas Distribution
Operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to
purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use the NiSource Gas Distribution
Operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services.

Electric Competition.

In 1996, the FERC ordered that all public utilities owning, controlling or
operating electric transmission lines file non-discriminatory, open-access tariffs and offer
wholesale electricity suppliers and marketers the same transmission service they provide to
themselves. In 1997, the FERC accepted for filing Northern Indiana’s open-access transmission
tariff and issued an opinion on December 31, 2002. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a
final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule
was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service.
In compliance with the rule, Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric
transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs
under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission
Tariff was retired. (See “Electric Operations — Regulatory Matters” included in Item 7.)

NiSource’s Other Operations subsidiaries also experience competition for energy sales and related
services from third party providers. NiSource meets these challenges through innovative programs
aimed at providing energy products and services at competitive prices while also providing new
services that are responsive to the evolving energy market and customer requirements.

Financing Subsidiary

NiSource Finance is a wholly-owned, consolidated finance subsidiary of NiSource that engages in
financing activities to raise funds for the business operations of NiSource and its subsidiaries.
NiSource Finance was incorporated in February 2000 under the laws of the state of Indiana.
NiSource Finance’s obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NiSource.

Other Relevant Business Information

NiSource’s customer base is broadly diversified, with no single customer accounting for a
significant portion of revenues.

As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of whom 3,405 were subject to collective
bargaining agreements.

For a listing of certain subsidiaries of NiSource refer to Exhibit 21.

NiSource files various reports with the SEC. The reports include the annual report on Form 10-K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed
or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. NiSource
makes all SEC filings available without charge to the public on its web site at

http://www.nisource.com

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

NiSource Inc.

There are many factors that could have a material adverse effect on NiSource’s operating results
and financial condition. New risks may emerge at any time, and NiSource cannot predict those risks
or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance. Each of the risks described
below could adversely impact the value of NiSource’s securities.

NiSource has substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect its financial condition.

NiSource has a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding as a result of the acquisition of
Columbia. NiSource had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately $6,610 million outstanding
as of December 31, 2005. The substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to
investors. For example, it could:

Some of NiSource’s debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debt-to-capital ratios
and cross-default provisions. NiSource’s failure to comply with any of these covenants could
result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of
outstanding debt obligations.

NiSource’s costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant. The costs of compliance
with future environmental laws and the incurrence of environmental liabilities could impact cash
flow and profitability.

NiSource’s subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental
requirements that, among other things, regulate air emissions, water usage and discharges,
remediation and the management of chemicals, hazardous waste and solid waste. Compliance with
these legal requirements requires NiSource to commit significant expenditures for installation of
pollution control equipment, remediation, environmental monitoring, emissions fees and permits at
many of NiSource’s facilities. These expenditures are significant, and NiSource expects that they
will continue to be significant in the future.

If NiSource’s subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or causes harm to
the environment or persons, even if caused by factors beyond NiSource’s control, that failure or
harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against NiSource and
its subsidiaries. In September 2004, the EPA issued an NOV to Northern Indiana alleging violations
of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require capital expenditures beyond the EPA requirements that cannot be determined at this time and
could require payment of substantial penalties.

Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised, and new laws and regulations seeking to
protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to NiSource’s subsidiaries. Revised or
additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating
restrictions on NiSource’s facilities or increased compliance costs, which may not be fully
recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income. The cost impact of any new or
amended legislation would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at
this time.



ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

A significant portion of the gas and electricity NiSource sells is used by residential and
commercial customers for heating and air conditioning. Accordingly, the operating results
fluctuate depending on the weather and, to a certain extent, the price of gas or electricity.

Energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather. Forecasts of energy sales are based on normal
weather, which represents a long-term historical average. Significant variations from normal
weather could have, and have had, a material impact on energy sales. Additionally, residential
usage, and to some degree commercial usage, have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity
costs for gas and electricity, whereby usage declines with increased energy costs, thus affecting
NiSource’s financial results.

NiSource’s electric operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries.

Electric operations in northern Indiana have been and may continue to be adversely affected by
events in the steel and steel related industries. In particular, sales to large industrial
customers in these industries have been impacted by economic downturns generally, and may be
affected by consolidation and globalization within such industries.

The majority of NiSource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the
impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings.

Virtually all of NiSource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal
or state level. As such, the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to
regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority. Two NiSource companies are
currently obligated to participate in rate reviews, which determine the energy rates charged to
customers, and directly impacts revenues. As part of a settlement reached in other regulatory
proceedings, Northern Indiana has agreed to file an electric base rate case with the IURC on or
before July 1, 2008. The outcome for the rate case could have a material effect on NiSource’s
financial results. Also, Columbia of Virginia has been directed to file schedules normally
associated with a rate case by May 1, 2006, as part of the VSCC’s investigation into the justness
and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginia’s rates.

Certain events that are beyond NiSource’s control have increased the level of public and regulatory
scrutiny of the industry. Regulatory authorities’, governmental and market reactions to these
events may have negative impacts on NiSource’s business, financial condition and access to capital.

As a result of the energy crisis in California during the summer of 2001, the recent volatility of
natural gas prices in North America, the bankruptcy filing by Enron Corporation, the blackout in
the Northeast in 2003, accounting irregularities at public companies in general and energy
companies in particular, and investigations by governmental authorities into energy trading
activities, companies in the regulated and unregulated utility business have been under a generally
increased amount of public and regulatory scrutiny and suspicion. All of the above-mentioned
factors have caused regulators and legislators to review current regulatory practices, operating
practices and accounting practices. The capital markets and ratings agencies also have increased
their level of scrutiny. NiSource believes that it is complying with all applicable laws and
accounting standards, but it is difficult or impossible to predict or control what effect these
types of events may have on the business, financial condition or access to the capital markets.

NiSource’s recent outsourcing initiative and service agreement with IBM may not achieve the level
of savings that was originally anticipated. Additionally, many associated changes in systems and
personnel are being made, increasing operational and control risk during transition, which may have
an impact on the business and its financial condition.

NiSource expects the 10-year agreement with IBM to deliver upwards of $530 million in gross savings
in operating and capital costs. This cost savings is dependent upon many factors, and
unanticipated changes in operations may cause actual cost savings to be substantially less than
expected. Many functions are being transitioned to IBM and many new personnel are assuming
responsibilities across these functions, increasing the risk of operational delays, potential
errors and control failures which may have an impact on NiSource and its financial condition.
Additionally, new information technology systems and process changes are also being put into place
increasing the risk of operational delays, potential errors and control failures which may have an
impact on NiSource and its financial condition.



ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

NiSource’s Whiting merchant energy project is operating at a loss.

NiSource owns and operates a merchant energy facility, Whiting Clean Energy, at BP’s Whiting,
Indiana refinery. This facility uses natural gas to generate electricity for sale in the wholesale
markets and to generate steam for industrial use by BP’s refinery and as such, the profitability of
this facility is dependant upon the market prices for electricity and natural gas, regional load
dispatch patterns and the steam requirements of BP’s refinery. It is anticipated that the facility
will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas
and electricity. The after-tax loss for Whiting Clean Energy was approximately $21.5 million for
2005 and $29.6 million for 2004.

generating stations with a net capability of 3,059 mw, six gas-fired generating units with a net
capability of 323 mw and two hydroelectric generating plants with a net capability of 10 mw. These
facilities provide for a total system net capability of 3,392 mw. It has 291 substations with an
aggregate transformer capacity of 23,182,800 kilovolt-amps. Its transmission system, with voltages
from 34,500 to 345,000 volts, consists of 3,184 circuit miles of line. The electric distribution
system extends into 21 counties and consists of 7,739 circuit miles of overhead and 1,940 cable
miles of underground primary distribution lines operating at various voltages from 2,400 to 12,500
volts. Northern Indiana has distribution transformers having an aggregate capacity of 12,426,163
kilovolt-amps and 471,936 electric watt-hour meters.

Northern Indiana now operates three coal-fired generation stations with a net capacity of 2,574 mw,
six gas-fired generating units with a net capacity of 323 mw and two hydroelectric plants with a
net capability of 10 mw, totaling a net capability of 2,907 mw. Northern Indiana’s Mitchell
Station, indefinitely shut down in 2002, is not included in the net capacity above. Northern
Indiana’s generating requirements are currently under review. Northern Indiana’s Integrated
Resource Plan, filed with the IURC in November 2005, indicated a gap between customer demand
projections and company owned generating capability, primarily in peak hours during the summer.
Northern Indiana is also considering capacity requirements associated with its varying load.

Other Operations.

PEI owns and operates the Whiting Clean Energy project at BP’s Whiting, Indiana
refinery, which is a 525 mw cogeneration facility that uses natural gas to produce electricity for
sale in the wholesale markets and also provides steam for industrial use. Through other
subsidiaries, NiSource owns the Southlake Complex, its 325,000 square foot headquarters building
located in Merrillville, Indiana and other residential and development property that it holds for
resale in Indiana.



ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Character of Ownership.

The principal offices and properties of NiSource and its subsidiaries are
held in fee and are free from encumbrances, subject to minor exceptions, none of which are of such
a nature as to impair substantially the usefulness of such properties. Many of the offices in
various communities served are occupied by subsidiaries of NiSource under leases. All properties
are subject to liens for taxes, assessments and undetermined charges (if any) incidental to
construction. It is NiSource’s practice regularly to pay such amounts, as and when due, unless
contested in good faith. In general, the electric lines, gas pipelines and related facilities are
located on land not owned in fee but are covered by necessary consents of various governmental
authorities or by appropriate rights obtained from owners of private property. NiSource does not,
however, generally have specific easements from the owners of the property adjacent to public
highways over, upon or under which its electric lines and gas distribution pipelines are located.
At the time each of the principal properties was purchased a title search was made. In general, no
examination of titles as to rights-of-way for electric lines, gas pipelines or related facilities
was made, other than examination, in certain cases, to verify the grantors’ ownership and the lien
status thereof.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

NiSource Inc.

1.

Virginia Natural Gas, Inc. v. Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation, Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission

On January 13, 2004, VNG filed with the FERC a “Complaint Seeking Compliance with the Natural
Gas Act and with Regulations and Certificate Orders of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
and Seeking Remedies” in Docket No. RP04-139. VNG alleged various violations during the winter
of 2002-2003 by Columbia Transmission of its firm service obligations to VNG. VNG sought
monetary damages and remedies (exceeding $37 million), and also sought certain prospective
remedies. On July 29, 2004, the FERC issued an order in which it refused to grant VNG any
monetary damages and said such claims are best determined by a court of law. The FERC also
agreed with Columbia Transmission that Columbia Transmission had not abandoned its obligation to
provide service and that it had not inappropriately continued interruptible service to the
detriment of firm service. However, the FERC did find that Columbia Transmission had failed to
exercise sufficient due diligence in its modifications to or its operation of vaporization
equipment at its Chesapeake LNG facility and that Columbia Transmission had failed to deliver
gas to VNG at 250 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) as called for by the agreement between VNG
and Columbia Transmission. The FERC declined VNG’s request to award damages in this case and,
as noted above, stated that any claim for damages could best be determined by a court of law.
Both VNG and Columbia Transmission sought rehearing of the FERC order, but the FERC denied the
requests for rehearing. Both Columbia Transmission and VNG have appealed the FERC’s decision to
the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, where the appeals are currently
pending.

2.

Stand Energy Corporation, et al. v. Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation, et al.,
Kanawha County Court, West Virginia

On July 14, 2004, Stand Energy Corporation filed a complaint in Kanawha County Court in West
Virginia. The complaint contains allegations against various NiSource companies, including
Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, and asserts that those companies and certain “select
shippers” engaged in an “illegal gas scheme” that constituted a breach of contract and violated
state law. The “illegal gas scheme” complained of by the plaintiffs relates to the Columbia
Transmission and Columbia Gulf gas imbalance transactions that were the subject of the FERC
enforcement staff investigation and subsequent settlement approved in October 2000. Columbia
Transmission and Columbia Gulf filed a Notice of Removal with the Federal Court in West Virginia
on August 13, 2004 and a Motion to Dismiss on September 10, 2004. In October 2004, however, the
plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint, which clarified the identity of some of the
“select shipper” defendants and added a federal antitrust cause of action. On January 6, 2005,
the Court denied the Columbia companies’ motion to strike the Second Amended Complaint and
granted the plaintiffs leave to amend. To address the issues raised in the Second Amended
Complaint, the Columbia companies revised their briefs in support of the previously filed
motions to dismiss. In June 2005, the Court granted in part and denied in part the Columbia
companies’ motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. The Columbia companies have filed an
answer to the Second Amended Complaint. One of the plaintiffs, Atlantigas Corporation, has been
dismissed from the case, and has appealed the dismissal to the Court of Appeals. On December 1,
2005, Plaintiffs filed a motion to certify this case as a class action. The Court has ordered
that discovery will proceed on the issue of class certification as well as the merits.

3.

Vivian K. Kershaw et al. v. Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., et al., Chautauqua County
Court, New York

Plaintiffs filed a complaint in 2000 against CNR a former subsidiary, Columbia Transmission,
Columbia and CER. The complaint alleges that plaintiffs own an interest in oil and gas leases
in New York and that the defendants have underpaid royalties on those leases by, among other
things, failing to base royalties on the price at which natural gas is sold to the end-user and
by improperly deducting post-production costs. Plaintiffs seek the alleged royalty underpayment
and punitive damages. The complaint also seeks class action status on behalf of all royalty
owners in oil and gas leases owned by the defendants. Discovery is proceeding regarding class
certification issues.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (continued)

4.

United States of America ex rel. Jack J. Grynberg v. Columbia Gas Transmission
Corporation, et al., U.S. District Court, E.D. Louisiana

The plaintiff filed a complaint in 1997, under the False Claims Act, on behalf of the United
States of America, against approximately seventy pipelines, including Columbia Gulf and Columbia
Transmission. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants had submitted false royalty reports to
the government (or caused others to do so) by mis-measuring the volume and heating content of
natural gas produced on Federal land and Indian lands. The Plaintiff’s original complaint was
dismissed without prejudice for misjoinder of parties and for failing to plead fraud with
specificity. The plaintiff then filed over sixty-five new False Claims Act complaints against
over 330 defendants in numerous Federal courts. One of those complaints was filed in the
Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against Columbia and thirteen
affiliated entities (collectively, the “Columbia defendants”).

Plaintiff’s second complaint, filed in 1997, repeats the mis-measurement claims previously made
and adds valuation claims alleging that the defendants have undervalued natural gas for royalty
purposes in various ways, including sales to affiliated entities at artificially low prices.
Most of the Grynberg cases were transferred to Federal court in Wyoming in 1999.

The defendants, including the Columbia defendants, have filed motions to dismiss for lack of
subject matter jurisdiction in this case. Oral argument on the motions to dismiss was held on
March 17 and 18, 2005 before a Special Master. On May 13, 2005, the Special Master issued his
report and recommendations and recommended dismissal of the action against the Columbia
defendants. The decision of the Special Master has been briefed and argued by the parties and
presented to the Federal District Court Judge for a final ruling, which is expected in the first
quarter of 2006.

5.

Tawney, et al. v. Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., Roane County, WV Circuit Court

The Plaintiffs, who are royalty owners, filed a lawsuit in early 2003 against CNR alleging that
CNR underpaid royalties by improperly deducting post-production costs and not paying a fair
value for the gas produced from their leases. Plaintiffs seek the alleged royalty underpayment
and punitive damages claiming that CNR fraudulently concealed the deduction of post-production
charges. The court has certified the case as a class action that includes any person who, after
July 31, 1990, received or is due royalties from CNR (and its predecessors or successors) on
lands lying within the boundary of the state of West Virginia. All claims by the government of
the United States are excluded from the class. CNR appealed the decision certifying the class
and the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals denied the appeal. Although NiSource sold CNR in
2003, NiSource remains obligated to manage this litigation and also remains at least partly
liable for any damages awarded to the plaintiffs. In December 2004, the court granted
plaintiffs’ motion to add NiSource and Columbia as defendants. The trial was originally
scheduled for the first quarter of 2006, but has been continued indefinitely, pending review by
the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals on one of the material issues in the case.

6.

Environmental Protection Agency Notice of Violation

On September 29, 2004, the EPA issued an NOV to Northern Indiana for alleged violations of the
Clean Air Act and the Indiana SIP. The NOV alleges that modifications were made to certain
boiler units at three of Northern Indiana’s generating stations between the years of 1985 and
1995 without obtaining appropriate air permits for the modifications. Northern Indiana is
currently in discussions with the EPA regarding possible resolutions to this NOV.

As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 46,451 common stockholders of record and 272,622,905 shares
outstanding.

On November 1, 2004, NiSource issued approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the
settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSource’s
SAILS

sm

. NiSource received approximately $144.4 million in satisfaction of the
SAILS

sm

holders’ obligation under the stock purchase contracts, which was used to pay
down short-term borrowings. Effective November 1, 2004, the interest rate on the $144.4 million of
debentures that comprised the debt component of the SAILS

sm

was reset to 3.628% per
annum. The debentures mature November 1, 2006.

In February 2003, NiSource issued approximately 13.1 million shares of common stock associated with
the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component of the Corporate PIES.
Concurrently with the settlement of the forward agreements, NiSource remarketed the underlying
debentures, due February 19, 2005, and reset the interest rate to 4.25%. NiSource received net
proceeds of $344.1 million from the remarketing in satisfaction of the Corporate PIES holders’
obligation under the forward equity agreements. The sole purchaser of the remarketed debentures
purchased newly-offered 6.15% notes of NiSource Finance due March 1, 2013, using the remarketed
debentures as consideration.

Holders of shares of NiSource’s common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, as and if
declared by NiSource’s Board out of funds legally available. The policy of the Board has been to
declare cash dividends on a quarterly basis payable on or about the 20th day of February, May,
August and November. Beginning with the November 2003 dividend, NiSource reduced its annual
dividend to $0.92 per share from $1.16 per share in line with the company’s objectives of ongoing
debt reduction, cash flow and core business reinvestment for the future. This decision was also
influenced by the fact that its dividend yield and payout ratio prior to the dividend reduction
were higher than industry averages. NiSource paid quarterly common dividends totaling $0.92 per
share for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. At its January 6, 2006 meeting, the Board
declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.23 per share, payable on February 20, 2006 to holders of
record on January 31, 2006.

Although the Board currently intends to continue the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on
common shares, the timing and amount of future dividends will depend on the earnings of NiSource’s
subsidiaries, their financial condition, cash requirements, regulatory restrictions, any
restrictions in financing agreements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.



ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES (continued)

NiSource Inc.

As a holding company, NiSource depends on dividends received from its operating subsidiaries.
Dividends from those subsidiaries may be subject to regulatory limitations. Northern Indiana’s
charter provides that so long as any shares of Northern Indiana’s cumulative preferred stock are
outstanding, no cash dividends shall be paid or declared on its common stock in excess of 75% of
the net income available for the preceding calendar year, unless the aggregate of the capital
applicable to stocks subordinate as to assets and dividends to the cumulative preferred stock plus
the surplus, after giving effect to such common stock dividends, would equal or exceed 25% of the
sum of all obligations evidenced by bonds, notes, debentures or other securities, plus the total
capital and surplus. At December 31, 2005, the sum of the capital applicable to stocks subordinate
to the cumulative preferred stock plus the surplus was equal to 55% of the total capitalization
including surplus.

Note regarding forward-looking statements

The Management’s Discussion and Analysis, including statements regarding market risk sensitive
instruments, contains “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Investors and prospective investors should understand that many factors govern whether
any forward-looking statement contained herein will be or can be realized. Any one of those
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning NiSource’s plans,
objectives, expected performance, expenditures and recovery of expenditures through rates, stated
on either a consolidated or segment basis, and any and all underlying assumptions and other
statements that are other than statements of historical fact. From time to time, NiSource may
publish or otherwise make available forward-looking statements of this nature. All such subsequent
forward-looking statements, whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of NiSource,
are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. All forward-looking statements are
based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance
that actual results will not differ materially.

Realization of NiSource’s objectives and expected performance is subject to a wide range of risks
and can be adversely affected by, among other things, weather, fluctuations in supply and demand
for energy commodities, growth opportunities for NiSource’s businesses, increased competition in
deregulated energy markets, the success of regulatory and commercial initiatives, dealings with
third parties over whom NiSource has no control, the effectiveness of NiSource’s outsourcing
initiative, actual operating experience of NiSource’s assets, the regulatory process, regulatory
and legislative changes, changes in general economic, capital and commodity market conditions, and
counter-party credit risk, many of which risks are beyond the control of NiSource. In addition,
the relative contributions to profitability by each segment, and the assumptions underlying the
forward-looking statements relating thereto, may change over time.

CONSOLIDATED REVIEW

Executive Summary

NiSource is an energy holding company whose subsidiaries are engaged in the transmission, storage
and distribution of natural gas and the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in
the high-demand energy corridor stretching from the Gulf Coast through the Midwest to New England.
NiSource generates virtually 100 percent of its operating income through these rate-regulated
businesses. A significant portion of NiSource’s operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations in
sales. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, net revenues
from gas are more significant, and during the cooling season, which is primarily from June through
September, net revenues from electric sales and transportation services are more significant than
in other months.

NiSource had been registered as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding company Act of
1935, as amended. On August 8, President Bush signed the “Energy Policy Act of 2005” into law
which, among other things, effectively repealed the Public Utility Holding company Act of 1935.
NiSource is now a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, which was
issued as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource
Inc.

The effective date for this change was February 8, 2006. Through this new law, the FERC was
granted many of the oversight provisions previously held by the SEC.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, NiSource reported income from continuing operations before
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $283.6 million, or $1.05 per basic
share, compared with income from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle of $431.0 million, or $1.63 per basic share, for 2004. The decrease in
earnings was primarily the result of $82.8 million of pre-tax restructuring and transition costs
incurred in connection with an outsourcing agreement with IBM initiated during 2005, a $108.6
million pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt, asset impairment charges of $21.8
million and other factors discussed below.

Operating results for 2005 were also adversely impacted by higher depreciation expense, primarily
from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio; decreased usage
of natural gas by utility customers, driven in part by higher gas prices; incremental costs
associated with the MISO in NiSource’s Indiana electric market; and lower net revenues in the gas
transmission and storage business due primarily to the 2004 renegotiation of contracts with
NiSource pipelines’ major customers, net of remarketing activities. These impacts were partially
offset by increases in net revenues from Gas Distribution and Electric Operations, primarily driven
by favorable weather versus a year ago, regulatory initiatives including trackers and increased
electric sales to residential and commercial customers, and improved results from Whiting Clean
Energy. These factors are discussed in more detail within the following discussions of “Results
of Operations” and “Results and Discussion of Segment Operations.”

Natural gas prices on the wholesale market hit all-time highs in late 2005 due to a national
imbalance between supply and demand that was complicated by the unusually active hurricane
season. The higher natural gas prices contributed to lower natural gas usage by customers,
which in turn affected NiSource’s results, particularly in Gas Distribution Operations.

While Hurricanes Katrina and Rita were disruptive, they did not cause severe damage to NiSource’s
pipelines, and the costs of repairing damage to pipeline facilities did not have a material impact
on NiSource’s 2005 results.

Contributing to the decline in EPS was an increase in the average number of shares outstanding at
December 31, 2005, compared to the year earlier, due primarily to the issuance of approximately 6.8
million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts
associated with the SAILS

sm

on November 1, 2004.

Four-Point Platform for Growth

NiSource made significant progress during 2005 on each of its four key initiatives to build a
platform for long-term, sustainable growth: expansion and commercial growth in the pipeline
and storage business; regulatory and commercial initiatives; financial management; and process
and expense management.

Expansion and Commercial Growth in the Pipeline and Storage Business.

NiSource’s Columbia
Transmission launched an open season for a proposed expansion of its natural gas transmission
system in the growing Mid-Atlantic markets. This Eastern Market expansion is moving forward
to a 2009 in-service date, based on definitive agreements with four East Coast customers. The
Eastern Market expansion is a development project to expand existing Mid-Atlantic storage and
transmission assets to provide almost 100,000 Dth/day of storage for eastern growth markets.
Millennium, which is targeting a fourth quarter of 2007, in-service date, filed an amended
certificate application with the FERC in August 2005. Also in August, Millennium signed
Consolidated Edison and KeySpan as anchor customers. The Hardy Storage project is on track to
develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in Hardy and
Hampshire Counties, West Virginia. Hardy Storage, which is being jointly developed by
Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont, filed its formal project application with
the FERC in April 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction
should begin as scheduled early in 2006 and storage injections by project customers are
scheduled as early as the spring of 2007.

Regulatory and Commercial Initiatives.

As a regulated company, NiSource is exposed to regulatory
risk and manages this risk by monitoring its operations and working with various regulatory bodies
to maintain a business that continues to provide value for its customers and stockholders in this
changing environment. During 2005, NiSource continued to make progress with regulatory and
commercial initiatives.

On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing
the continuation of the Customer Choice

sm

Program. The renewed program provides
residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier
while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the
previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement
programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs
for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers.

On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates
by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay State’s request for a performance based
rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program.

Refer to the “Results and Discussion of Segment Operations” for a complete discussion of Regulatory
matters.

Financial Management.

During 2005, NiSource refinanced $2.4 billion in long-term debt that will
yield approximately $43 million in annual interest savings beginning in 2006. In September 2005,
NiSource Finance issued $450 million of 5.25% 12-year unsecured notes that mature September 15,
2017 and $550 million of 5.45% 15-year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2020. The
proceeds were used in part to redeem $900 million of NiSource Finance notes on November 15, 2005.
Additionally, on November 28, 2005, NiSource Finance issued $900 million in senior notes, the
proceeds of which, along with other funding sources, were used to refinance $1.1 billion of
Columbia senior unsecured notes that became callable on November 28, 2005.

In March 2005, NiSource entered into a $1.25 billion revolving credit agreement to fund future
working capital requirements and other corporate needs. The new five-year agreement replaced
previous agreements and reduced interest expense by approximately $0.5 million during 2005. It is
expected to reduce interest expense by approximately $1.2 million annually beginning in 2006.

In addition, NiSource put in place a new $300 million short-term credit facility during November
2005. This new facility has significantly bolstered the company’s liquidity position. NiSource
ended the year with $626.5 million of unused credit facilities.

Process and Expense Management.

In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a
definitive agreement to provide a broad range of business process and support services to NiSource.
The 10-year agreement is expected to deliver approximately $395 million in net savings, after
costs to achieve this transition and transformation of systems, in operating and capital costs
across NiSource’s 15 primary operating subsidiaries over the course of the contract, as well as
provide new tools and technology advances and enhanced service capabilities. Included in the
transformation process during 2005 and 2006 are major projects in Human Resources, Finance and
Accounting, Supply Chain, Gas Management, Operations and Meter to Cash. The identified net savings
do not include efficiencies and other benefits from a three-year project to implement common work
management solutions (WMS) and geographical information systems (GIS) across operations.

During December 2005 and extending into 2006, NiSource initiated a corporate streamlining effort
that will include reducing office locations, realigning executive compensation and reducing
executive positions.

NiSource
Inc.

2006 Outlook

Consistent with the 2006 guidance included within the press release
issued on January 31, 2006, NiSource’s 2006 projection for income from continuing operations is in the range of $1.42 to $1.52
basic earnings per share. This projection is based on typical assumptions such as normal weather,
customer growth offsetting usage declines, and customary increases in costs such as depreciation,
taxes and employee and administrative expenses. Other factors built into NiSource’s business plan
include: the successful completion of key regulatory and commercial initiatives; achieving expected
savings from the outsourcing to IBM; deferral of MISO costs beginning August 1, 2006, and modest
deterioration of results from Whiting Clean Energy, which benefited from a strong market during the
summer 2005 period.

NiSource expects additional transition costs associated with the outsourcing initiative with IBM of
approximately $14 — $15 million, or 3 cents per basic share. This expectation is included in the
earnings projection above.

Higher natural gas prices that contributed to the natural gas usage decline during 2005 may
continue to impact 2006 results.

NiSource also intends to increase the level of capital expenditures and other investing activities
during 2006. For 2006, the projected capital program is expected to be $638.2 million, which is
$39.2 million higher than the 2005 level. This higher spending is mainly due to an increase in
expenditures for integrity-management improvements in the pipeline segment and expenditures to
replace key components within electric generation in addition to new business projects. The
program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations.

Ethics and Controls

NiSource has always been committed to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well
as requiring a strong commitment to ethical behavior by its employees. During 2005, NiSource
tested all significant controls across its financial processes and NiSource’s management has
concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end
of the period covered by this Form 10-K. Refer to “Management’s Report on Internal Controls Over
Financial Reporting” included in Item 9A. NiSource’s senior management takes an active role in the
development of this Form 10-K and the monitoring of the company’s internal control structure and
performance. In addition, NiSource will continue the mandatory ethics-training program in which
employees at every level and in every function of the organization participate.

Results of Operations

The Consolidated Review information should be read taking into account the critical accounting
policies applied by NiSource and discussed in “Other Information” of this Item 7.

Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, NiSource reported income from continuing operations
before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $283.6 million, or $1.05 per basic
share, compared to $431.0 million, or $1.63 per basic share in 2004. Income from continuing
operations before the cumulative change in accounting principle for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2003 was $426.9 million, or $1.64 per basic share.

Including results from discontinued operations and the change in accounting principle, NiSource
reported 2005 net income of $306.5 million, or $1.13 per basic share, 2004 net income of $436.3
million, or $1.65 per basic share, and 2003 net income of $85.2 million, or $0.33 per basic share.

Net Revenues

Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2005 were $3,149.8 million, a $98.0 million increase compared with 2004. The change
was driven by $64.3 million increase in Gas Distribution Operations net revenues, $34.9 million
increase in Electric Operations net revenues and $20.4 million in increased net revenues from Other
Operations, partially offset by decreased revenues of $21.9 million from Gas Transmission and
Storage Operations. Favorable weather during 2005 as compared to 2004 drove approximately $24
million and $27 million of the increases for Gas Distribution Operations and Electric Operations,
respectively. Net revenues also improved due to overall increased regulatory and non-regulatory
tracker revenues of $33.6 million which are offset in operating expenses, increased residential and
commercial customers and increased overall customer usage within Electric Operations contributing
approximately $24.4 million, improved results from

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource
Inc.

Whiting Clean Energy of $17.6 million, increased residential customers for Gas Distribution
Operations contributing approximately $8 million, and $12.1 million recognized on the buyout of a
large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a decline in
customer usage within gas operations of approximately $33.1 million, lower Gas Transmission and
Storage Operations revenues of $20.3 million attributable to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service
contracts with major pipeline customers, net of remarketing activities, and increases in the cost
of service for Electric Operations associated with MISO amounting to $15.7 million.

Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 were $3,051.8
million, a $4.6 million decrease compared with 2003. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues
decreased $36.0 million, primarily as a result of reduced residential and commercial natural gas
deliveries due to warmer weather of approximately $33 million compared to the previous year and
lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products, releases of
capacity and gas cost incentives that amounted to $33.1 million partially offset by increased
revenues from regulatory strategies of approximately $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement
granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. The
reduction in Gas Distribution Operations net revenue was partially offset by a $31.6 million
increase in electric net revenue for 2004 as compared to 2003. This was the result of higher net
revenues from environmental trackers, increased customer usage and the effect of reserves recorded
for regulatory refunds in the comparable 2003 period.

Expenses

Operating expenses were $2,197.0 million in 2005, a $222.7 million increase from 2004 due to higher
operation and maintenance expenses of $124.7 million, higher depreciation and amortization of
$36.6 million, higher other taxes of $36.1 million and an impairment and loss on sale of assets of
$22.2 million during 2005 compared to a gain on sale of assets of $3.1 million in 2004. The
increase in operation and maintenance expenses was primarily due to restructuring charges,
including a pension and other postretirement benefit charge, transition costs and consulting fees
related to the outsourcing initiative and service agreement with IBM which totaled $82.8 million,
increased expense for uncollectible accounts of $4.6 which are partly offset in revenues, increased
tracked expenses of $33.6 million which are offset in revenues, and higher electric generation
expenses of $7.2 million. Depreciation expense increased approximately $30 million as a result of
the expiration in November 2004 of the prior Columbia of Ohio regulatory stipulation that allowed
for deferral of certain depreciation amounts. The 2004 period benefited from a reduction in
estimated property tax accruals amounting to $33.0 million, while gross receipts tax increased
$16.0 million in 2005, which is offset in revenue. In addition, goodwill associated with Kokomo
Gas was impaired by $10.9 million and certain software systems were impaired totaling $10.9 million
due to the outsourcing initiative and service agreement with IBM.

Operating expenses of $1,974.3 million for 2004 increased $40.2 million over 2003 due primarily to
the comparable 2003 period being favorably impacted by insurance recoveries, recovery of previously
uncollected accounts receivable under the Columbia of Ohio bad debt tracker, and the reversal of
legal, environmental, and other accrued expenses of approximately $40.5 million and a $16.6 million
gain on the sale of Columbia Service Partners. Operating expenses for 2004 were favorably impacted
by a reduction in estimated property taxes of $29.3 million partially offset by an increase in
depreciation expense of approximately $13 million.

Other Income (Deductions)

Other Income (Deductions) in 2005 reduced income $519.8 million compared to a reduction of $405.1
million in 2004. A loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt of $108.6 million during 2005
compared to a $4.1 million loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt during 2004 was the
primary reason for the increase in other deductions. Interest expense, net increased $17.1 million
from 2004 primarily due to the impact of higher short-term interest rates on variable rate debt and
higher average long-term debt balances due to the prefunding of November 2005 debt maturities.
Other, net increased $6.7 million primarily as the result of higher interest income.

Other Income (Deductions) in 2004 reduced income $405.1 million compared to a reduction of $460.5
million in 2003. Interest expense, net decreased $60.8 million from 2003 primarily due to lower
long-term interest rates and a decrease in total debt of $354 million from December 31, 2003.

Income Taxes

Income taxes decreased $92.0 million in 2005 as compared with 2004 primarily due to lower pre-tax
income from the prior year. Income taxes increased $6.5 million in 2004 over 2003 primarily as a
result of higher pre-tax income. The effective income tax rates were 34.5%, 35.9%, and 35.5 % in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Contributing to the reduction in the effective tax rate for
2005 versus 2004 is the impact of the tax benefit associated with the electric production deduction
(discussed below), an adjustment to deferred taxes at Northern Indiana related to a reduction in
deferred income tax requirements and a reduction in deferred state income tax liabilities resulting
from a revised estimate of consolidated state income tax apportionment factors. Offsetting these
reductions is an increase in the effective tax rate associated with the non-deductible goodwill
impairment charge recorded at Kokomo Gas and increased taxes related to Ohio income tax law changes
enacted on June 30, 2005.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, signed into law on October 22, 2004, created new Internal
Revenue Code Section 199 which, beginning in 2005, permits taxpayers to claim a deduction from
taxable income attributable to certain domestic production activities. Northern Indiana and
Whiting Clean Energy’s electric production activities qualify for this deduction. The deduction is
equal to 3% of QPAI for the taxable year, with certain limitations. This deduction increases to 6%
of QPAI beginning in 2007 and 9% of QPAI beginning in 2010 and thereafter. The 2005 tax benefit
associated with the Section 199 domestic production deduction is estimated to be $1.9 million and
will be finalized prior to inclusion in NiSource’s 2005 consolidated federal income tax return to
be filed in 2006.

Discontinued Operations

Discontinued operations reflected income of $23.2 million, or $0.08 per basic share, in 2005, $5.3
million, or $0.02 per basic share, in 2004 and a loss of $332.9 million, or loss of $1.28 per
basic share, in 2003. Current year’s income from discontinued operations, net-of-taxes, is
due to a gain on discontinued operations of $43.5 million offset by a loss of $20.3 million.
The gain on disposition of discontinued operations, net-of-taxes, resulted from changes to
reserves for contingencies related primarily to the previous sales of IWC, former Primary
Energy subsidiaries and other dispositions. The loss from discontinued operations included
changes to reserves for contingencies primarily related to CER and an impairment of assets
related to Transcom. In 2004, income from discontinued operations, net-of-taxes, is primarily
from a reduction in estimated income taxes associated with NiSource’s former exploration and
production subsidiary, CER. In 2003, an after-tax loss of $301.2 million was related to the
sale of CER, while a loss of $29.1 million was recognized on the sale of six PEI subsidiaries
and a loss of $1.3 million on the sale of Transcom.

Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2005 of $0.3 million, net-of-taxes,
resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. The cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle in 2003 of $8.8 million, net-of-taxes, resulted from the cumulative
effect of adopting SFAS No. 143. Refer to Note 10, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for additional information regarding the cumulative
effect of adopting FIN 47.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating
requirements. A significant portion of NiSource’s operations, most notably in the gas
distribution, gas transportation and electric distribution businesses, is subject to seasonal
fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through
March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements.
During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the
electric business during the summer cooling season and external short-term and long-term financing,
is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary
maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas.

Operating Activities

Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was $712.3
million, a decrease of $343.6 million from a year ago. This decrease was due primarily to the
impact of accounts receivable balances which were $267 million higher due mainly to the impact of
higher gas prices, and the additional $114 million of cash required for deferred tax payments
mostly due to the expiration in 2004 of “bonus” tax depreciation enacted under the Job Creation and
Worker Assistance Act of 2002.

Investing Activities

On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel-related, “inside-the-fence” assets of its
subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name
“Primary Energy”. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in
cash and the assumption of debt-related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such
liabilities and the after-tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSource’s debt by $273.6
million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold
as discontinued operations and has adjusted all periods presented accordingly.

On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER, to a
subsidiary of Triana for $330 million, plus Triana’s assumption of obligations to deliver
approximately 94.0 Bcf of natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. On January 28,
2003, NiSource’s former subsidiary, CNR, sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and
production assets in New York for approximately $95 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as
discontinued operations and has adjusted all periods presented accordingly. During 2003, NiSource
recognized an after-tax loss of $301.2 million related to the sales.

Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities.

For 2005, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $599.0 million, an
increase of $75.6 million over 2004. This increase was primarily due to construction of the
Columbus Northern Loop Pipeline project at the Gas Distribution Operations segment and incremental
pipeline expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in compliance with the
DOT’s Integrity Management Rule.

The Gas Distribution Operations segment’s capital program in 2005 included new business initiatives
to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to
the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to
ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The
Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily on modernizing and upgrading
facilities and new business initiatives to maintain and expand market share in storage and
transportation interstate commerce by meeting the demands of consumers who will use gas for
electric power generation and meeting the needs of existing, new or growing customers through the
construction of



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource
Inc.

significant new facilities, either wholly-owned by NiSource or in partnership with
other qualified project participants. The Electric Operations segment capital program included
improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution
assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to
electric distribution systems related to new business. Capital expenditures in the Other
Operations segment mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise-wide information
technology infrastructure improvement.

For 2006, the projected capital program is expected to be $638.2 million, which is $39.2 million
higher than the 2005 level. This higher spending is mainly due to an increase in expenditures for
integrity-management improvements in the pipeline segment and expenditures to replace key
components within electric generation in addition to new business projects. The program is
expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations.

Financing Activities

On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to periodically sell
up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The
registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSource’s
pre-existing shelf capacity, provided an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. As of
December 31, 2005, NiSource’s shelf capacity is currently $850 million.

Long-term Debt.

On November 29, 2005, Columbia redeemed $1.1 billion of its senior unsecured notes
that became callable on November 28, 2005, having an average interest rate of 7.34%. On November
28, 2005, Columbia redeemed $281.5 million of its senior unsecured notes with an average interest
rate of 6.80%. The associated charges included an $86 million non-cash charge relating to the
write-off of the unamortized portion of a fair market value adjustment made at the time of the
NiSource Columbia merger, an $8 million non-cash charge associated with the unamortized portion of
swap termination charges, and a $14 million cash charge for call premiums, all of which were
charged to loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt.

On November 28, 2005, NiSource Finance issued, in the private placement market, $900 million in
unregistered senior unsecured notes in four tranches: $315 million of 7-year notes at a coupon rate
of 5.21%; $230 million of 10-year notes at a coupon rate of 5.36%; $90 million of 11-year notes at
a coupon rate of 5.41%; and $265 million of 20-year notes at a coupon rate of 5.89%. The proceeds,
along with other funding sources, were used to refinance the above mentioned Columbia senior
unsecured notes.

On November 15, 2005, NiSource Finance redeemed $900 million of its senior unsecured notes having
an average interest of 7.625%.

On September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of 5.25% 12-year unsecured notes that
mature September 15, 2017 and $550 million of 5.45% 15-year unsecured notes that mature September
15, 2020. The proceeds were used in part to redeem $900 million of NiSource Finance notes due
November 15, 2005. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes, NiSource
Finance settled $900 million of forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to
NiSource’s swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of
the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively.

During July 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $34 million of its medium-term notes with an average
interest rate of 6.62%.

During June 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $39.3 million of its medium-term notes and Bay State
redeemed $10 million of its medium-term notes with an average interest rate of 6.79% and 6.58%,
respectively.

During April 2005, Capital Markets redeemed $30 million of its medium-term notes, with an average
interest rate of 7.67%.

On November 23, 2004, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of five-year floating rate unsecured
notes that mature November 23, 2009. The notes are callable, at par, on or after November 23,
2006. Subsequently, on December 10, 2004, NiSource Finance used $250 million of the proceeds from
the $450 million floating rate note offering to

redeem $250 million of existing floating rate notes
that were due May 2005. The remaining proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finance
short-term borrowings.

On November 1, 2004, NiSource issued approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the
settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSource’s
SAILS

sm

. NiSource received approximately $144.4 million in satisfaction of the
SAILS

holders’ obligation under the stock purchase contracts, which was used to pay
down short-term borrowings. Effective November 1, 2004, the interest rate on the $144.4 million of
debentures that comprised the debt component of the SAILS

sm

was reset to 3.628% per
annum. The debentures mature November 1, 2006.

During July 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $32 million of its medium-term notes, with an average
interest rate of 6.53%.

During April 2004, Capital Markets redeemed $80 million of its medium-term notes, with an average
interest rate of 7.39%.

During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium-term notes and Bay
State redeemed $10 million of its medium-term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.49% and
7.63%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.5 million, of which $4.1 million was
charged to loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt and $0.4 million was recorded as a
regulatory asset.

Credit Facilities.

On November 30, 2005, NiSource Finance entered into a new $300 million 9-month
revolving credit agreement with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein LLC. The new facility will further
improve NiSource’s available liquidity in the current environment of volatile natural gas prices.

During March 2005, NiSource Finance obtained a new $1.25 billion five-year revolving credit
facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an expiring
$500 million 364-day credit facility, as well as a $750 million three-year credit facility that
would have expired in March 2007.

As of February 28, 2006, there were $717.5 million of borrowings under the existing facilities.
NiSource had short-term cash investments of $7.1 million as of that date.

NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances of $898.0 million at December 31, 2005, at a
weighted average interest rate of 4.95%, and advances of $307.6 million at December 31, 2004, at a
weighted average interest rate of 3.04%. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, NiSource
had $101.6 million and $111.6 million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At
December 31, 2005, $72.7 million of the $101.6 million total outstanding letters of credit resided
within a separate bi-lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource obtained
during February 2004. Of the remaining $28.9 million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding at
December 31, 2005, $25.5 million resided under NiSource’s five-year credit facility and $3.4
million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution. As of
December 31, 2005, $626.5 million of credit was available under both credit facilities.

Debt Covenants.

NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under both its five-year revolving
credit facility and its nine-month revolving credit agreement. NiSource must maintain a debt to
capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of December 31, 2005, NiSource was in compliance
with this financial covenant in both of its credit agreements.

NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such
covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSource’s assets,
generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting
security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSource’s consolidated net
tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and/or transfer of
NiSource’s assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit
facilities also include a cross-default provision, which triggers an event of default under the
credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource
or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more.

NiSource’s bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However,
NiSource’s bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured
payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on
NiSource’s assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests,
preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of
NiSource’s consolidated net tangible assets.

Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables.

On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to
sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CORC, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated
May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts
receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts
receivable under the agreement. The agreement has a scheduled expiration date of May 12, 2006, and
can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, $175 million of
accounts receivable had been sold by CORC.

Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping
and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives
a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services.

On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of
its trade receivables, as they originate, to NRC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana.
NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest
in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200
million of accounts receivable under the agreement. NRC’s agreement with the commercial paper
conduit has a scheduled expiration date of December 22, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed
to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, NRC had sold $200 million of accounts receivable.
Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indiana’s debt
rating falls below BBB- or Baa3 at Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s, respectively.

Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and
cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which
provides adequate compensation, for such services.

Credit Ratings.

NiSource’s credit ratings continue to be affirmed by the major rating agencies.
Both Moody’s Investors Services and Standard and Poor’s affirmed their ratings in December of 2005.
Moody’s Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the
existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moody’s ratings outlook for NiSource and its
subsidiaries is stable. Standard and Poor’s affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at
BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poor’s outlook for NiSource
and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating
for NiSource and the BBB+ ratings for Columbia and Northern Indiana. Fitch’s outlook for NiSource
and all of its subsidiaries is stable.

Certain TPC gas trading agreements contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral if
the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB- by Standard and
Poor’s or Baa3 by Moody’s. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger
levels would amount to approximately $20 million to $25 million. In addition to agreements with
ratings triggers, there are other gas trading agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or
“material adverse change” provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount
to approximately $170 million to $175 million.

Columbia Energy Services is the principal for two surety bonds issued to guarantee performance in
two separate long-term gas supply agreements. The surety, in accordance with the terms of its
indemnity agreements, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of
approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2005, the
total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $72.7 million. The
agreement will expire on December 31, 2008.

Columbia was the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales
agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia and had
indemnity values, which

declined over time and had ratings triggers based on Columbia’s credit
rating. In the third quarter of 2005, these bonds expired. In February 2006, the forward sales
agreements guaranteed by Columbia were completed.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments.

NiSource has certain contractual obligations
that extend beyond 2006. The obligations include long-term debt, lease obligations, and purchase
obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total

The long-term debt amounts shown above represent payment of principal and do not include associated
interest costs. For 2006, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of
approximately $381 million, which includes $338 million of interest payments related to its
long-term debt. NiSource also has obligations associated with various taxes and expects to make
tax payments of approximately $638 million in 2006.

NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and
storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2006 to 2019, require
NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges.

In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad
range of business process and support services to NiSource. As part of this agreement, IBM will
operate a broad range of business support functions for NiSource, including processes within the
Human Resources, Finance and Accounting, Supply Chain (procurement), Customer Contact, Meter to
Cash (billing and collections) and Information Technology areas. The agreement also includes a
broad array of transformational consulting services and emerging technology expertise. The
contract has a 10-year term and NiSource has the right to renew it for up to three additional
years. NiSource will pay for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The
variable charge component can fluctuate to reflect NiSource’s actual usage of service and service
levels. Fees may be adjusted to reflect economic changes such as inflation or business changes that
both parties agree to.

Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by
IBM), NiSource must pay IBM a termination charge that will include a breakage fee, repayment of
IBM’s un-recovered capital investments, and IBM wind-down expense. This termination fee can be a
material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the
termination.

Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products
and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under
this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a
combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various
performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana
terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty-year contract period.

Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSource’s pension fund assets as of September 30,
2005, have increased for the third year in a row. Additionally, $9.1 million in employer
contributions were made during 2005 to certain of NiSource’s qualified and non-qualified pension
plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical
periods and expects to contribute approximately $7.1 million in 2006 to certain pension plans.
However, NiSource may provide additional funding for the pension plans. As a result of the
increase in the fair value of the plan assets and certain changes to the pension plans and benefits
provided, NiSource expects pension expense for 2006 to decrease
approximately $15.7 million from
the amount recognized in 2005. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $54.2 million to
its postretirement medical and life plans in 2006.

Market Risk Disclosures

Risk is an inherent part of NiSource’s energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly
and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk
involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify,
assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following
principal trading and non-trading risks that are involved in NiSource’s energy businesses:
commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a
multi-faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment
and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSource’s senior management takes an
active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that
require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification,
assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and
complex nature of the energy business, NiSource’s risk management policies and procedures
continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification.

Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSource’s market and credit
risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio
from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level.

Non-Trading Risks

Commodity price risk resulting from non-trading activities at NiSource’s rate-regulated
subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power,
fuel and gas costs through the rate-making process. If states should explore additional regulatory
reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional
rate-making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk.

As a result of the fixed-to-variable interest rate swap transactions referenced below, $1,160
million of NiSource Finance’s existing long-term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest
rates.

NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings
under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes,
which have interest rates that are indexed to short-term market interest rates. NiSource is also
exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed-to-variable interest rate
swaps that hedge the fair value of long-term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt
obligations subject to fluctuations in short-term market interest rates during 2005 and 2004, an
increase in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest
expense by $20.1 million and $20.5 million for the years 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of
forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long-term debt. The
$900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12-year forward
starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15-year
forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource
Inc.

During September 2005, NiSource Finance settled these forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to
NiSource’s swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of
the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively.

On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in a
notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2-year term. NiSource Finance
will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount
based on U.S. 6-month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of
premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the
swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid-market.

On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in
a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11-year term. NiSource Finance
will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount
based on U.S. 6-month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of
premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the
swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid-market.

On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in a
notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a
fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6-month BBA LIBOR plus
an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps.
These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004.

On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreement in a
notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty
amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the
remaining term of the underlying debt.

Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSource’s business
activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or
counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before
the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when
counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from
the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and
potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial
instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, stand-by letters of credit and
guarantees. Because many of NiSource’s exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also
estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical
analysis of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to
reduce individual counterparty credit risk.

Trading Risks

The transactions associated with NiSource’s power trading operations give rise to various risks,
including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices
of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over-the-counter contracts for the
purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require
settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. As of
December 31, 2005, all power trading contracts were settled. TPC may enter into power derivative
contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with operating Whiting Clean Energy, which
may not qualify for hedge treatment as determined by SFAS No. 133.

Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms-length
transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract
volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively
quoted markets such as the NYMEX, other external sources including electronic exchanges and
over-the-counter broker-dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black-Scholes
option pricing model.

Market Risk Measurement

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates,
indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in
losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one-day VaR at a 95%
confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a
variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market
exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was less than $0.1 million, $0.4
million and zero, during 2005, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and
trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.1
million during 2005, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.5 million
for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio
risk. The VaR limit for power trading was $2.5 million, however, this limit was reduced to zero in
the third quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts. Should TPC enter
into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with Whiting Clean
Energy, those contracts would be limited to the physical generation capacity of Whiting Clean
Energy.

Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies” included in this Item 7 and Note 1-S, “Accounting for Risk
Management and Energy Trading Activities,” and Note 6, “Risk Management and Energy Trading
Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSource’s
risk management.

Off Balance Sheet Items

NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.1 billion of commodity-related
payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and to satisfy requirements
under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to
counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas.
To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity-related contracts subject to these guarantees,
such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other
guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit
outstanding. Refer to Note 6, “Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities,” and Note 17, “Other
Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information about NiSource’s off balance sheet arrangements.

Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products
and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under
this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a
combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various
performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana
terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty-year contract period.

In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSource’s accounts receivable
programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140.
In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put
presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other
receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs.
Refer to Note 16, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on these agreements.

Other Information

Critical Accounting Policies

NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below
that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSource’s results of operations
and Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.

SFAS No. 71, provides that rate-regulated
subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of
the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the
costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that
such rates can be charged and collected. NiSource’s rate-regulated subsidiaries follow the
accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to
utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in
service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets
and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,203.1 million and $1,386.1
million at December 31, 2005, and $998.4 million and $1,222.3 million at December 31, 2004,
respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1-F, “Basis of Accounting for
Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its
costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the
criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write-down of all or a portion of
NiSource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is
approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally
accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during
such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable
amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required
to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In management’s opinion, NiSource’s regulated
subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future.

Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets require
specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of
these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for
deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory
action amounted to $49.8 million at December 31, 2005. If NiSource determined that the amounts
included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be
required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts.

Accounting for Risk Management Activities.

Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the
fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation.
Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other
comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of
such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective
portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in
earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and
losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged
item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate-regulated subsidiaries generally record
gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings
when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized
in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates.

In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the
hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness
test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter,
throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be
ineffective are recorded currently in earnings.

Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate
certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is
such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the
underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange-traded natural gas futures and options
contracts and over-the-counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its
natural-gas-related businesses. NiSource had $376.0 million and $209.4 million of price risk

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource
Inc.

management assets, of which $338.1 million and $200.0 million related to hedges, at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively, and $94.5 million and $52.4 million of price risk management
liabilities, of which $85.6 million and $26.7 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income,
net-of-taxes, was $150.7 million and $93.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Accounting for Energy Trading Activities.

NiSource is not presently involved in energy trading
activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective
of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource
evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative
contracts under SFAS No. 133.

Pursuant to EITF No. 98-10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including
“energy-related contracts” such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be
accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts,
recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF
No. 98-10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to
market. Refer to Note 6, “Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statement for further information.

While the assessment of fair values for NiSource’s trading contracts have been mainly based on
pricing information for exchange-traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to
gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair
value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and
storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the
sale or expiration of all gas-trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power
trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair
value employing the widely-used Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the
“mark-to-fair-value” options outstanding was zero and a loss of $3.0 million at December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of zero and $8.8
million and price risk management liabilities of zero and $11.9 million, at December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities.

Pensions and Postretirement Benefits.

NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and
other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106.
The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a
significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities
to present value, long-term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions.
Due to the size of the plans and the long-term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in
the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of
the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSource’s pensions
and other postretirement benefits see Note 9, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

FASB Interpretation No. 47 — Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations.

In March
2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations
and to provide additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to
reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143.
This interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2005. NiSource has adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 2005. Refer to Note 10,
“Asset Retirement Obligations,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.

SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) — Share-Based Payment.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.
123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized
in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting
for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the
first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, as directed by the SEC
in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4-01(a) of Regulation

S-X. NiSource will adopt this standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the
statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining
portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered.
Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on
a pro-forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified
or settled after December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R.

NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of
SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in
the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as
previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock
options, the current share-based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are
currently. For 2006, NiSource’s Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent
executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares.

Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions.

On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft,
“Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions,” an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks
to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and
measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would
require that a tax position meet a “probable recognition threshold” for the benefit of an uncertain
tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition
in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that
position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based
solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of
the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for
March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December
15, 2006.

Environmental Matters

NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated
with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations,
certain LDCs and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas
less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations
using mercury-containing measuring equipment.

The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors
including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible
parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only
those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered “probable and
reasonably estimable” under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96-1. As costs become probable and
reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes
that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately
liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSource’s financial position.

Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United
States and worldwide to reduce so-called “greenhouse gases” such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of
burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage
in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently
a participant in United States EPA’s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and
participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas
emissions.

Bargaining Unit Contract

As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of which 3,405 were subject to collective
bargaining agreements. These agreements expire in various periods between 2006 and 2013. Northern
Indiana’s agreement, which covers over half of the total bargaining unit employees, expires on May
31, 2009.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued)

Competition

Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor-owned, municipal, and cooperative electric
utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas
utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong
competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas.
Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial
markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates
are primarily driven by low-cost, coal-fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas
competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets
mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane-based heating which, over time, has
comprised a declining percentage of the overall market.

Restructuring

Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection
with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from
NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas
Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability
remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, “Restructuring Activities,” in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring
initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment.

Regulatory Matters

Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE

®

opportunities, where customers
can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of
its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations’
residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier.

On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing
the continuation of the Customer Choice

sm

Program. The renewed program provides
residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while
avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous
pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that
provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the
winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers.

On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to
establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for
the recovery over a five-year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On
October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible
Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCO’s approval of
this application resulted in Columbia of Ohio’s commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible
accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004.
As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable
pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohio’s application to
decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad
debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a
reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery.

On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates
of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop
Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and
contemplates an approximately 25-mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and
southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for
Columbia of Ohio’s customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of
Ohio’s construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the
project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006.

On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to
increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery
of Columbia of Ohio’s deferred PIP balance over a twelve-month period plus the expected level of
arrears during each succeeding twelve-month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio
supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to



ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued)

extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This
filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf.
Columbia of Ohio’s Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its
November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative
within the 45-day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty-five day period, and on
January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider
rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which
it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohio’s application (as supplemented) on the 46th day
after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs,
reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and
after March 2, 2006.

On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the
Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to
increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay State’s request for a
performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure
replacement program.

On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a
performance based rate-making methodology (“PBR Plan”), which would freeze non-gas cost rates at
their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order
on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation
(“Investigation”) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginia’s current rates,
charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of
Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before
February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion
to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006.

Northern Indiana’s gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in
1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined
annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity
component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC
approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the
demand component filing. Northern Indiana’s GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the
sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas
supply portfolio cost to a market-based benchmark price.

Northern Indiana’s GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004
through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August
24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on
the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indiana’s GCA5.

Northern Indiana’s GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005
through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim
basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in
the second quarter of 2006.

On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement
Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the
Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The
new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indiana’s Choice program for
customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings
of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the
settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain
defined issues during the term of this agreement.

Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program “Winter Warmth” in the fourth quarter of
2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income
and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected
from ratepayers through a volumetric

surcharge. The one-year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the
fourth quarter of 2004.

Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar
year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005
extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final
order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006.
The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will
contribute $1.0 million of the total funding.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of
December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions.
Refer to Note 17-F, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment.

Market Conditions

Spot prices for the winter of 2004-2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00-$8.00/Dth. This was
a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003-2004 that were in the
$4.00-$6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004-2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all-time
high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293
Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004-2005 winter season left national storage
levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf.

During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of
September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the
devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production
platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached
3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five-year average. Through
December 2005, the winter of 2005-2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth,
while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth.

All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state-approved recovery mechanisms that
provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as
pass-through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs
included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the
difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer
billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been
adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost.

The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non-traditional revenue sources within the
evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services
upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories
and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products
are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company
and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on-system
services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and
balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give
the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such
things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce
pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of
transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others
using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice
programs described above under “Regulatory Matters.”

Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities

The Gas Distribution Operations segment’s net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in
2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital
expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and
upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled
approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006.

Weather

In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer
demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree-days. Normal is evaluated using
heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for
measuring heating degree-days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load
begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62
degrees.

Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder
than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the
year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004.

Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer
than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003.

Throughput

Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared
to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off-system and transportation
sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential
sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased
in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE

®

program, where they
would purchase gas from a third party supplier.

Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared
to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off-system, industrial, and
transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of
warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003.

Net Revenues

Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues
grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder
weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers
that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of
regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in
operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract.
These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential
and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused
largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005.

Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of
decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather
during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33
million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction
programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and
reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were
partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of
approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net
revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the
recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State.

Operating Income

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations
segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The
decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of
tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described
above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges,
including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated
with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating
income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004
expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of
goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in
1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations
segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The
decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of
$29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million
and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably
impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004
and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the
bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003.

Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project

Millennium has proposed a pipeline project, in which Columbia Transmission is participating and
will serve as operator, which will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the
Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the
project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at
the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a
lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York.
Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New
York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City
metropolitan market.

The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the
original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until
certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now
being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act,
which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not
consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millennium’s appeal of that decision to the
United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States
Department of Commerce ruling relating to the project’s Hudson River crossing plan in the United
States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending.

On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended
filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details
construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent
agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of
the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on
completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin,
Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the “Companion Pipelines.” The timing of
receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact
the targeted in-service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of
Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to
begin construction in Spring 2007.

The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by
DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia
Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia
purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute
that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the
other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an
MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia
Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbia’s ownership
will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with
the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re-writing the
partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions
require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least
three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan
and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process
identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia
Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term
sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to
finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in “final draft” form. The equity
redistribution and the re-writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the
end of the first quarter of 2006.

Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control
over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from
the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership
agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millennium’s key employees, selection of the
construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject
to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of
at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005,
whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize
its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This
approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered
“substantive participating rights” as discussed in EITF 96-16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding
additional aspects of the project may impair Millennium’s ability to recover in rates certain
development costs it has previously incurred.

Hardy Storage Project

In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to
jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market
demand for natural gas in the eastern United States.

Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage
field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and
Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as
operator of the facilities.

An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the
project’s storage capacity under long-term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity
to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and
will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four
customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long-term
firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued)

deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas
transmission system to create this capacity.

Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with
the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is
scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be
available in 2007.

Other Growth Projects

Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and
southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects
was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast
customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and
southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate
regulatory applications during 2006.

Pipeline Firm Service Contracts

Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990’s, the services of Columbia
Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open
access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided
primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and
Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized
a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The
terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range
from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions
were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from
remarketing efforts and new firm contracts.

Regulatory Matters

On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the “Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs.” This
guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for
accounting of the DOT’s Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January
1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the
rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be
permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is
anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 — $12 million in future years
related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOT’s
Integrity Management Rule.

On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmission’s annual EPCA filing.
The FERC’s order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address
issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric
Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was
filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without
modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the
company.

On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmission’s March
1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmission’s March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC,
with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM
filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order.

Restructuring

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in
connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource
Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and
Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining
at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, “Restructuring Activities,” in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives
for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental
response actions. Refer to Note 17-F, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations.

Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment’s capital expenditure program was $167.9
million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due
to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects
and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project
is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania.
New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8
million in 2006.

Throughput

Columbia Transmission’s throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and
other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid-Atlantic,
midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf
reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short-haul
transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in
northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and
Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this
segment.

Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005,
compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were
offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission.

Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004,
compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer
weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other
non-weather factors.

Net Revenues

Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was
primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers,
which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory
trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net
revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from
remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third-party buyout of a bankruptcy
claim relating to the rejection of a shipper’s long-term contract.

Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was
due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the
expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October
31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual
revenues.

Operating Income

Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the
reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of
tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges,
including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with
the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense
were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense.



ITEM 7.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued)

Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue
decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due
primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve
for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit
settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the
sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and
depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period.

Market Conditions

The regulatory frameworks applicable to Electric Operations continue to be affected by fundamental
changes that will impact Electric Operations’ structure and profitability. Notwithstanding those
changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and
revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing
environment.

Electric Operations (continued)

The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international
competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has
responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position
in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered
production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international
producers and those in the United States.

Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year.
It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as
much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once
again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel
industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004.

In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 - 85% of contracted
amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad
Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected
electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for
PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second
quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if
coal deliveries will be impacted.

Restructuring

Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a
NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource
Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations
amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was
zero. Refer to Note 3, “Restructuring Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric
Operations segment.

Regulatory Matters

During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate
review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement.
The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will
receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225
million, for the minimum 49-month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate
moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a
specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated
based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1
million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were
recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation
of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in
the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional
control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for
Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana
Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired.

The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of
electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under “Day 1”, the
MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under “Day 2” the MISO dispatches wholesale
electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its
responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and
managing the day-ahead, real-time and financial transmission rights markets.

As part of Northern Indiana’s use of the MISO’s transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana
incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC-approved tariff, as well as administrative fees,
which relate to the MISO’s management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1
transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied
recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indiana’s rate moratorium. Day 2
charges consist of fuel-related and non-fuel-related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued
an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel-related Day 2 costs. The order denied



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Electric Operations (continued)

recovery or deferral of non-fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indiana’s rate moratorium, which
expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types
of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non-fuel. These particular charges, which amounted
to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indiana’s FAC-69 filing, but,
pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full
amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indiana’s FAC-69 filing, but noted that this
particular category of charges was approved “subject to refund” and subject to the final order. On
February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through
the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the
charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power & Light, Vectren Energy
Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non-fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs
recorded as non-recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were
recorded as non-recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is
authorized to begin the deferral of all non-fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after
July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established
settlements process with market participants, MISO uses “resettlement” statements to make
adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be
anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed.

In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004,
the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is
located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the
Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC
seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and
conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006,
the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement
agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana
lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law.
Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light
of the City of Gary’s need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting
the facility.

On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and
Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indiana’s
retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in
this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final
order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs
incurred in August to December 2005 as described below.

On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource,
filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three-year arrangement pursuant
to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energy’s
generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana.
On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and
energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the
Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is
issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim
purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21,
2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the
IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte County’s Petition for Reconsideration. On
September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURC’s Order of August 31,
2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on
January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three-year arrangement.
The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the
intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which
were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and
final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006.

Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19,
2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial
Group agreed to support Northern Indiana’s recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its
FAC for the period August 9, 2005



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Electric Operations (continued)

through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indiana’s agreement
to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008.

Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its
customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a
negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were
prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed
testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval
from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005.

Northern Indiana filed FAC-68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of
intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim
Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005.

Northern Indiana filed FAC-69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual
intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included
recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order
approving the FAC-69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost
recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The
recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to
refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above).

On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern
Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by
Northern Indiana to implement IDEM’s NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related
operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become
operational through an EERM. Under the IURC’s November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is
permitted to submit filings on a semi-annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the
EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indiana’s latest compliance plan with the
estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million
for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed
ECR-5 simultaneously with EER-2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those
components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating
expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR-5 and EER-2 on March
23, 2005. ECR-6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated
depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight
modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR-7 simultaneously with EER-3 for
capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed
in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through
December 31, 2005.

On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by
Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indiana’s service quality was not reasonably
adequate. While concluding that Northern Indiana’s service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled
that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special
fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from
recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURC’s
order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On
June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting
a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter
and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana’s Motion to Stay
the IURC’s April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million
to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line
and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On
December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand
asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the
appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the
sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern
Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for
remand filed by Jupiter.

Electric Operations (continued)

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31,
2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note
17-F, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment.

Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities

The Electric Operations segment’s capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is
projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures
for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation.
Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted
to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were
approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006.

Sales

Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh
compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due
primarily to warmer weather, increases in non-weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer
count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales.

Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared
to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler
weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non-weather related usage and
customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases
occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August,
which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater.

Net Revenues

Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from
2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million
compared to the 2004 period, and increased non-weather related usage and customer count totaling
$24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which
$6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially
offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million
reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the
purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy.

Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from
2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7
million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non-weather related usage and
customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003
period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler
weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million.

Operating Income

Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease
was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses
associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The
operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a
pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing
and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of
$7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other
tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax
accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of
which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue.

Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase
was primarily a result of the above-mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes
of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million.
Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1



ITEM 7.

Electric Operations (continued)

million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased
due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and
administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In
addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the
year-over-year increase in operating expenses.

Lake Erie Land Company, Inc.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of
$2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations
of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at
$12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An
additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next
twelve-months, are reflected as assets held for sale.

Sale of SunPower Corporation

In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchaser’s common
shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource
recognized a pre-tax gain of $3.4 million and an after-tax gain of $2.0 million related to this
sale.

Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP.

On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for
approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the
fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre-tax gain of $7.5 million and an after-tax gain of
$4.4 million related to this sale which is included in “Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of
assets” on the Statements of Consolidated Income.

Sale of PEI Assets

On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel-related, “inside-the-fence” assets of its
subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name
“Primary Energy”. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in
cash and the assumption of debt-related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such
liabilities and the after-tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSource’s debt by $273.6
million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold
as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly.

PEI Holdings, Inc.

Whiting Clean Energy.

PEI’s Whiting Clean Energy project at BP’s Whiting, Indiana refinery was
placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the
extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an
agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under
which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant
modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the
insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs.

For 2005, the PEI holding companies’ consolidated after-tax loss was approximately $22.6 million.
The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among
other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph,
prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the
profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BP’s oil refinery. During the
first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Other Operations (continued)

of the terms of its agreement with BP’s oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised
agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BP’s need for steam, while reducing the power
plant’s required run time for the next three years.

In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request
for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of
intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy.
Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such
intermediate dispatchable power.

On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource,
filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three-year arrangement pursuant
to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energy’s
generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana.
On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and
energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the
Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is
issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim
purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21,
2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the
IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte County’s Petition for Reconsideration. On
September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURC’s Order of August 31,
2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on
January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three-year arrangement.
The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the
intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which
were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and
final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006.

Restructuring

Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from
NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, “Restructuring Activities,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives
for the Other Operations segment.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005,
a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17-F,
“Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment.

Net Revenues

For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million
from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and
$7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers.

For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million
from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a
lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million.

Operating Loss

The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an
operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased
losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial
and industrial marketing customers.

The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an
operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase
in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity
investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4
million.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors of NiSource Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, statements of consolidated
capitalization and long-term debt of NiSource Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December
31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, common stockholders’ equity
and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item
8. We also have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and
financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedules, an opinion on management’s assessment, and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit of financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.



ITEM 8.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource
Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also in our opinion,
management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

As explained in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2003,
the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” As
explained in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, effective December 31, 2005, the
Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations.”

Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

A. Company Structure and Principles of Consolidation.

NiSource, a Delaware corporation, is a
holding company whose subsidiaries provide natural gas, electricity and other products and services
to approximately 3.8 million customers located within a corridor that runs from the Gulf Coast
through the Midwest to New England. NiSource is a holding company under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 2005. NiSource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the
operating results of its 16 direct subsidiaries.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NiSource and its majority-owned
subsidiaries after the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. Investments for
which at least a 20% interest is owned, certain joint ventures and limited partnership interests of
more than 3% are accounted for under the equity method. Except where noted above and in the event
where NiSource has significant influence, investments with less than a 20% interest are accounted
for under the cost method. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%
of Millennium, it does not exert control over the partnership and therefore did not consolidate the
Millennium project entities. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission
(47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan
Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the
operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was
with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the
other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia
Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity
redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this
transaction, Columbia’s ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE
will be 26.25% each. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, the partners in
Millennium performed a comprehensive due diligence review and completed a revised term sheet in
January 2006 to be utilized as a base to finalize revised partnership agreements and the
redistribution of Columbia Atlantic Trading’s equity. NiSource also consolidates variable interest
entities for which NiSource is the primary beneficiary as a result of the adoption in January 2003
of FIN No. 46.

B. Basis of Accounting Presentation.

In the Statements of Consolidated Income for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the classification of loss on early extinguishment of
long-term debt has been reclassified to “Other Income (Deductions).” NiSource previously reported
such amounts within operating income. This resulted in a $4.1 million increase in operating income
and a corresponding decrease to other income (deduction) for the twelve months ended December 31,
2004 and 2003. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income did not change for either period.

In the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, the
classification of accrued liability for postretirement and post employment benefits between current
and long term liabilities was changed to conform to the current year presentation. This resulted
in increases of $27.8 million in Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits and corresponding decreases
to Total Current Liabilities for balances as of December 31, 2004.

Certain other amounts in 2004 and 2003 have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.

C. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash.

NiSource considers all investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. NiSource reports amounts deposited in
brokerage accounts for margin requirements in the restricted cash balance sheet caption. In
addition, NiSource has amounts deposited in trust to satisfy requirements for the provision of
various property, liability, workers compensation, and long-term disability insurance, which is
classified as restricted cash and disclosed as an investing cash flow on the Statement of
Consolidated Cash Flows.

D. Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenue

. Accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets includes both billed and unbilled amounts as NiSource believes that total accounts
receivable is a more meaningful presentation, given the factors which impact both billed and
unbilled accounts receivable. Unbilled revenue is based on estimated amounts of electric energy or
natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its customers. Unbilled amounts of accounts receivable
relate to a portion of a customer’s consumption of gas or electricity from the date of the last
cycle billing date through the last day of the month (balance sheet date). Factors taken into
consideration when estimating unbilled revenue include historical usage, customer rates and
weather. Accounts receivable

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

fluctuates from year to year depending upon seasonality and price volatility. NiSource’s accounts
receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes unbilled revenue, less reserves, in the
amounts of $437.6 million and $293.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

E. Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

. NiSource’s investments in debt and marketable
securities are carried at fair value and are designated as available-for-sale. These investments
are included within “Other investments” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and
losses, net of deferred income taxes, are reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income.
These investments are monitored for other than temporary declines in market value. Realized gains
and losses and permanent impairments are reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Income.

At December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively, approximately $39 million and $36 million
of investments were pledged as collateral for trust accounts related to NiSource’s wholly owned
insurance company.

F. Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.

NiSource’s rate-regulated subsidiaries
follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. SFAS No. 71 provides that
rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the
economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are
designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and it is probable that such rates
can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate
determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are
recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or
refunded to customers.

In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its
costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the
criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write-down of all or a portion of
NiSource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery
was approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally
accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during
such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable
amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required
to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In management’s opinion, NiSource’s regulated
subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future.

Regulatory assets of approximately $1,066.4 million are not presently included in rate base and
consequently are not earning a return on investment. These regulatory assets are being
recovered as components of cost of service over a remaining life of up to 10 years.
Regulatory assets of approximately $49.8 million require specific rate action.

G. Utility Plant and Other Property and Related Depreciation and Maintenance.

Property, plant and
equipment (principally utility plant) are stated at cost. The rate-regulated subsidiaries record
depreciation using composite rates on a straight-line basis over the remaining service lives of the
electric, gas and common properties.

For rate-regulated companies, an AFUDC is capitalized on all classes of property except
organization, land, autos, office equipment, tools and other general property purchases. The
allowance is applied to construction costs for that period of time between the date of the
expenditure and the date on which such project is completed and placed in service, reducing gross
interest expense during the respective construction period. The pre-tax rate for AFUDC was 2.5% in
2005, 2.5% in 2004, and 2.0% in 2003. Short-term borrowings were used to fund construction efforts
for all three years presented. The increase in the 2004 AFUDC rate, as compared with 2003, was due
to higher short-term interest rates.

The depreciation provisions for utility plant, as a percentage of the original cost, for the
periods ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

The Whiting Clean Energy facility owned by PEI, a consolidated subsidiary of NiSource, is being
depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 40-year useful life.

Generally, NiSource’s subsidiaries follow the practice of charging maintenance and repairs,
including the cost of removal of minor items of property, to expense as incurred. When property
that represents a retired unit is replaced or removed, the cost of such property is credited to
utility plant, and such cost, net of salvage, is charged to the accumulated provision for
depreciation.

H. Carrying Charges and Deferred Depreciation.

Upon completion of units 17 and 18 at the R. M.
Schahfer Generating Station, Northern Indiana capitalized the carrying charges and deferred
depreciation in accordance with orders of the IURC, pending the inclusion of the cost of each unit
in rates. Such carrying charges and deferred depreciation are being amortized over the remaining
service life of each unit.

Northern Indiana has capitalized carrying charges and deferred depreciation and certain operating
expenses relating to its scrubber service agreement for its Bailly Generating Station in accordance
with an order of the IURC. The accumulated balance of the deferred costs and related carrying
charges is being amortized over the remaining life of the scrubber service agreement.

In the Columbia of Ohio 1999 rate agreement, the PUCO authorized Columbia of Ohio to revise its
depreciation accrual rates for the period January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2004. The revised
depreciation rates were lower than those which would have been utilized if Columbia of Ohio were
not subject to regulation and, accordingly, a regulatory asset had been established for the
difference. The amount of depreciation that would have been recorded for 2004 had Columbia of Ohio
not been subject to rate regulation is $36.4 million, a $20.5 million increase over the $15.9
million reflected in rates. The amount of depreciation that would have been recorded for 2003 had
Columbia of Ohio not been subject to rate regulations is $36.6 million, a $22.1 million increase
over the $14.5 million reflected in rates.

In 2005, the PUCO authorized Columbia of Ohio to revise its depreciation accrual rates for the
period beginning January 1, 2005. The revised depreciation rates are now higher than those which
would have been utilized if Columbia of Ohio were not subject to regulation. Accordingly, the
cumulative regulatory asset balance of $131.7 million through December 31, 2004 has been reduced in
2005. The amount of depreciation that would have been recorded for 2005 had Columbia of Ohio not
been subject to rate regulation is $35.2 million, a $6.1 million decrease over the $41.3 million
reflected in rates. The regulatory asset was $125.6 million as of December 31, 2005.

I. Amortization of Software Costs.

External and internal costs associated with computer software
developed for internal use are capitalized. Capitalization of such costs commences upon the
completion of the preliminary stage of each project in accordance with SOP 98-1. Once the
installed software is ready for its intended use, such capitalized costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over a period of five to ten years. NiSource amortized $28.3 million in 2005,
$35.0 million in 2004 and $29.1 million in 2003 related to software costs.

J. Intangible Assets.

NiSource has approximately $3.7 billion in goodwill and other intangible
assets. Substantially all goodwill relates to the excess of cost over the fair value of the net
assets acquired in the Columbia acquisition. In addition, NiSource has other intangible assets
consisting primarily of franchise rights apart from goodwill that were identified as part of the
purchase price allocations associated with the acquisitions of Bay State, Northern Utilities, which
is a subsidiary of Bay State, and Granite, all of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of NiSource,
which are being amortized over forty years from the date of acquisition. NiSource accounts for its
intangible assets, including goodwill, in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Refer to Note 8, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.

K. Revenue Recognition.

With the exception of amounts recognized for energy trading activities,
revenues are recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to
customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include
estimates for electricity and gas delivered. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to
be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery
of the commodities.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Revenues relating to energy trading operations are recorded based upon changes in the fair values,
net of reserves, of the related energy trading contracts. Changes in the fair values of energy
trading contracts are recognized in revenues net of associated costs. Gains and losses relating to
non-trading derivatives designated as cash flow or fair value hedges are reported on a gross basis,
upon settlement, in the same income statement category as the related hedged item. Normal purchase
or sale contracts are reported on a gross basis upon settlement and recorded in the corresponding
income statement category based on commodity type.

L. Earnings Per Share.

Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders
by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The weighted
average shares outstanding for diluted EPS include the incremental effects of the various long-term
incentive compensation plans.

The numerator in calculating both basic and diluted EPS for each year is reported net income. The
computation of diluted average common shares follows:

M. Estimated Rate Refunds.

Certain rate-regulated subsidiaries collect revenues subject to refund
pending final determination in rate proceedings. In connection with such revenues, estimated rate
refund liabilities are recorded which reflect management’s current judgment of the ultimate
outcomes of the proceedings. No provisions are made when, in the opinion of management, the facts
and circumstances preclude a reasonable estimate of the outcome.

N. Accounts Receivable Sales Program.

NiSource enters into agreements with third parties to sell
certain accounts receivable without recourse. These sales are reflected as reductions of accounts
receivable in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and as operating cash flows in the
accompanying Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. The costs of these programs, which are based
upon the purchasers’ level of investment and borrowing costs, are charged to other income in the
accompanying Statements of Consolidated Income.

O. Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

P. Fuel Adjustment Clause.

All metered electric rates contain a provision for adjustment to
reflect increases and decreases in the cost of fuel and the fuel cost of purchased power through
operation of a fuel adjustment clause. As prescribed by order of the IURC applicable to metered
retail rates, the adjustment factor has been calculated based on the estimated cost of fuel and the
fuel cost of purchased power in a future three-month period. If two statutory requirements
relating to expense and return levels are satisfied, any under-recovery or over-recovery caused by
variances between estimated and actual costs in a given three-month period are recorded as
adjustments to revenue and will be included in a future filing. Northern Indiana records any
under-recovery or over-recovery as a current regulatory asset or liability until such time as it is
billed or refunded to its customers. The fuel adjustment factor is subject to a quarterly hearing
by the IURC and remains in effect for a three-month period.

Q. Gas Cost Adjustment Clause.

All of NiSource’s Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries except
for Northern Indiana defer most differences between gas purchase costs and the recovery of such
costs in revenues, and adjust future billings for such deferrals on a basis consistent with
applicable state-approved tariff provisions.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Northern Indiana adjusts its revenues for differences
between amounts collected from customers and actual gas costs and adjusts future billings for such
deferrals on a basis consistent with applicable state-approved tariff
provisions.

R. Gas Inventory.

Both the LIFO inventory methodology and the weighted average methodology are
used to value natural gas in storage. The application of different methodologies is due to the
acquisition of Bay State. Bay State uses the weighted average cost of gas method, as approved by
state regulators, in setting its rates while both Northern Indiana and the Columbia subsidiaries
use the LIFO methodology when setting rates in their respective jurisdictions. Inventory valued
using LIFO was $445.4 million and $392.4 million at December 31, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
Based on the average cost of gas using the LIFO method, the estimated replacement cost of gas in
storage at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004,
exceeded the stated LIFO cost by $922.4 million
and $448.1 million, respectively. Inventory valued using the weighted average methodology was
$81.5 million at December 31, 2005 and $60.5 million at December 31, 2004.

S. Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities.

SFAS No. 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging
activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, unless such contracts are exempted as
normal under the provisions of the standard. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a
derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation.

NiSource uses a variety of derivative instruments (exchange traded futures and options, physical
forwards and options, financial commodity swaps, and interest rate swaps) to effectively manage its
commodity price risk and interest rate risk exposure. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically
designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or
liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows
of a forecasted transaction. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the
relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly
effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting
period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to
be ineffective are recognized currently in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003 the ineffectiveness on NiSource’s hedged instruments was immaterial.

Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other
comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such
derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective
portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in
earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. If a forecasted transaction
corresponding to a cash flow hedge is not expected to occur, the accumulated gains or losses on the
derivative are recognized currently in earnings. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are
recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a
result of the rate-making process, the rate-regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and
losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both
the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in
earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. When gains and losses are
recognized in earnings, they are recognized in cost of sales for derivatives that correspond to
commodity risk activities and are recognized in interest expense for derivatives that correspond to
interest-rate risk activities.

Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating
profits on, or from exposure to, shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the
contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under
SFAS No. 133. Trading contracts not meeting the criteria to be accounted for as derivatives under
SFAS No. 133 are recorded at fair value under EITF No. 02-03. EITF No. 02-03 indicates that when
certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including “energy-related contracts” such as
tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to
market) along with any related derivative contracts. The resulting gains and losses resulting from
marking these contracts to fair value are reported on a net basis and included currently in
earnings. Refer to Note 6, “Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

T. Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits.

NiSource records income taxes to recognize full
interperiod tax allocations. Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for
the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to
future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of
existing assets and liabilities. Previously recorded investment tax credits of the regulated
subsidiaries were deferred and are being amortized over the life of the related properties to
conform to regulatory policy.

To the extent certain deferred income taxes of the regulated companies are recoverable or payable
through future rates, regulatory assets and liabilities have been established. Regulatory assets
for income taxes are primarily attributable to property related tax timing differences for which
deferred taxes had not been provided in the past, when regulators did not recognize such taxes as
costs in the rate-making process. Regulatory liabilities for income taxes are primarily
attributable to the regulated companies’ obligation to credit to ratepayers deferred income taxes
provided at rates higher than the current federal income tax rate currently being credited to
ratepayers using the average rate assumption method and unamortized deferred investment tax
credits.

NiSource files consolidated federal and state income tax returns with certain of its other
affiliated companies. NiSource and its subsidiaries are parties to a tax allocation agreement
under which the consolidated tax is allocated among the members of the group in proportion to each
member’s relative contribution to the group’s consolidated tax liability. In addition, the
separate company tax benefits associated with NiSource’s tax losses, excluding tax benefits from
interest expense on acquisition debt, are allocated to NiSource’s subsidiaries with separate return
tax.

U. Environmental Expenditures.

NiSource accrues for costs associated with environmental
remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs is probable and the amounts can be
reasonably estimated, regardless of when the expenditures are actually made. The undiscounted
estimated future expenditures are based on currently enacted laws and regulations, existing
technology and site-specific costs. The liability is adjusted as further information is discovered
or circumstances change. The reserves for estimated environmental expenditures are recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets in “Other accruals” for short-term portions of these liabilities and
“Other noncurrent liabilities” for the respective long-term portions of these liabilities.
Rate-regulated subsidiaries applying SFAS No. 71 establish regulatory assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets to the extent that future recovery of environmental remediation costs is probable
through the regulatory process.

In addition, Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC in 2003 to recover costs associated
with environmental compliance programs for NOx pollution-reduction equipment at Northern Indiana’s
generating stations. Refer to Note 5, “Regulatory Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information.

V. Stock Options and Awards.

SFAS No. 123R requires companies to adopt the fair value method of
accounting for stock-based compensation. NiSource will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, as
allowed for and required by the SEC in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4-01(a) of Regulation
S-X. The fair value method would require the amortization of the fair value of stock-based
compensation at the date of grant over the related vesting period. NiSource applied the intrinsic
value method of APB No. 25 for awards granted under its stock-based compensation plans through
December 31, 2005. NiSource complies with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123. The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and EPS as if NiSource had applied the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation.

W. Excise Taxes.

NiSource accounts for excise taxes that are customer liabilities by separately
stating on its invoices the tax to its customers and recording amounts invoiced as liabilities
payable to the applicable taxing jurisdiction. These types of taxes, comprised largely of sales
taxes collected, are presented on a net basis affecting neither revenues nor cost of sales.
NiSource accounts for other taxes for which it is liable by recording a liability for the expected
tax with a corresponding charge to “Other taxes” expense.

X. Equity Forward Contracts.

NiSource accounted for equity forward contracts on its own common
shares as permanent equity consistent with the provisions of EITF No. 00-19. Accordingly, the
Corporate PIES and SAILS

sm

were recorded in equity at fair value at the date of
inception through the settlement of the their associated equity forward agreements with changes in
fair value not recognized as long as the contracts were classified as equity. Refer to Note 12,
“Common Stock,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

FASB Interpretation No. 47 — Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations.

In March
2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations
and to provide additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to
reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143.
This interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource has
adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 2005. Refer to Note 10, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) — Share-Based Payment.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.
123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized
in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting
for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the
first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, as directed by the SEC
in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4-01(a) of Regulation S-X. NiSource will adopt this
standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the
statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining
portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered.
Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on
a pro-forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified or settled after December 31, 2005 in
accordance with SFAS No. 123R.

NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of
SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle which



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in
the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as
previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock
options, the current share-based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are
currently. For 2006, NiSource’s Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent
executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares.

Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions.

On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft,
“Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions,” an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks
to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and
measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would
require that a tax position meet a “probable recognition threshold” for the benefit of an uncertain
tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition
in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that
position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based
solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of
the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for
March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December
15, 2006.

Restructuring Activities

During the second quarter of 2005, NiSource Corporate Services reached a definitive agreement with
IBM under which IBM will provide a broad range of business transformation and outsourcing services
to NiSource. The service and outsourcing agreement is for ten years with a transition period to
extend through December 31, 2006. In connection with the IBM agreement, a total reduction of
approximately 1,000 positions is expected through the transition period. Approximately 570 of the
impacted employees are expected to become employees of IBM or its subcontractors. As of December
31, 2005, 679 employees were terminated as a result of the agreement with IBM, of which 546 became
employees of IBM. In June 2005, NiSource recorded a restructuring charge of $16.4 million for
estimated severance payments expected to be made in connection with the IBM agreement. Of the
$16.4 million restructuring charge recorded for the second quarter, $11.2 million was recorded by
the Gas Distribution Operations segment, $2.7 million was recorded by the Gas Transmission and
Storage Operations segment, $1.8 million was recorded by the Electric Operations segment, $0.2
million was recorded by the Other Operations segment and $0.5 million was recorded by Corporate.
During the third quarter of 2005, NiSource recognized $18.0 million in restructuring charges for
non-cash pension and post-retirement benefit expense related to the severed employees, which is
reflected in the liability for postretirement and pension benefits. Of the $18.0 million
restructuring charge recorded in the third quarter, $10.6 million was recorded by the Gas
Distribution Operations segment, $3.5 million was recorded by the Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations segment, $2.0 million was recorded by the Electric Operations segment, $0.5 million was
recorded by the Other Operations segment and $1.4 million was recorded by Corporate. During the
fourth quarter of 2005, NiSource reduced the reserve by $0.6 million based on actual payments and
revised estimates. These restructuring charges are included in “Operation and maintenance” expense
on the Statements of Consolidated Income.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, NiSource announced a plan to reduce its executive ranks by
approximately 15% to 20% of the top-level executive group. In part, this reduction will come
through anticipated attrition and consolidation of basic positions. NiSource recognized a $2.9
million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2005 for anticipated severance payments
expected to be made in connection with this action.

In previous years, NiSource implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and
realize efficiencies as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. In 2000, these restructuring
initiatives included a severance program, a voluntary early retirement program, and a transition
plan to implement operational efficiencies throughout the company. In 2001, NiSource’s restructuring initiatives focused on creating operating efficiencies
in the Gas Distribution and the Electric Operations segments and included the closure of the
Mitchell Station in Gary, Indiana. During 2002, NiSource implemented a restructuring initiative
which resulted in employee terminations throughout the organization mainly affecting executive and
other management-level employees. In connection with these earlier restructuring initiatives, a
total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and

technical positions were
identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 1,565 employees were
terminated, of whom 3 employees were terminated during 2005.

Adjustments to the restructuring liability were recorded mainly for reductions in estimated
expenses related to previous restructuring initiatives. Of the $10.1 million remaining
restructuring liability from the Columbia merger and related initiatives, $9.6 million is related
to facility exit costs.

Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale

As part of PEI’s sale to Private Power in 2003, NiSource retained certain obligations with respect
to the former PEI subsidiaries. NiSource retained operational guarantees related to environmental
compliance, inventory balances, employee relations, and a contingent obligation to Private Power
that could be triggered if U.S. Steel exercised a purchase option under its agreement with a former
PEI subsidiary. At the time of the sale, NiSource allocated $0.6 million to this contingent option
obligation. However, in November 2005, U.S. Steel Gary Works announced its intent to exercise the
purchase option. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2005, NiSource accrued an additional $7.4
million for the probable settlement of this contingent obligation.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of
$2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations
of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at
$12.0 million as of December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An
additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next
twelve-months, are reflected as assets held for sale.

In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchaser’s common
shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter 2004,
NiSource had an after-tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale.

Columbia Transmission is in the process of selling certain facilities that are non-core to the
operation of the pipeline system. NiSource has accounted for the assets of these facilities, with
a net book value of $17.0 million, as assets held for sale. Based on discussion with the potential
buyer, NiSource does not believe that it is likely to sell certain
assets formerly held by Transcom that were valued at $6.1 million. These assets were written down
to zero in June 2005.

On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for
approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the
fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized an after-tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale
which is included in “Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets” on the Statements of
Consolidated Income.

On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel-related, “inside-the-fence” assets of its
subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name
“Primary Energy”. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in
cash and the assumption of debt-related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such
liabilities and the after-tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSource’s debt by $273.6
million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold
as discontinued operations and has adjusted all periods presented accordingly.

On September 30, 2003, NiSource sold Columbia Service Partners, a subsidiary of Columbia for
approximately $22.5 million. In 2003, NiSource recognized a pre-tax gain of $16.6 million related
to the sale. Columbia Service Partners had been reported as assets held for sale.

On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER, to a subsidiary
of Triana. Under the CER sales agreement, Triana, an affiliate of MSCP, purchased all of the stock
of CER for $330 million, plus the assumption of obligations to deliver approximately 94.0 Bcf of
natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. The sale transferred 1.1 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas reserves. Approximately $220 million of after-tax cash proceeds from the sale
were used to reduce NiSource’s debt. In addition, a $213 million liability related to the forward
sales contracts was removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On January 28, 2003, NiSource’s
former subsidiary CNR sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in
New York for approximately $95 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as discontinued operations
and has adjusted all periods presented accordingly. During 2004, NiSource realized after-tax net
income due primarily to tax adjustments, while an after-tax loss of $301.2 million related to the
sale of CER was recorded in 2003.

Results from discontinued operations of CER (including the New York State properties), the six PEI
subsidiaries, Transcom, Lake Erie Land and the water utilities are provided in the following table:

Regulatory Matters

Gas Distribution Operations Related Matters

Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE

®

opportunities, where customers
can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of
its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations’
residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier.

On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing
the continuation of the Customer Choice

sm

Program. The renewed program provides
residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while
avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous
pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that
provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the
winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers.

On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to
establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for
the recovery over a five-year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On
October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible
Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCO’s approval of
this application resulted in Columbia of Ohio’s commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible
accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements
in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable
pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohio’s application to
decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad
debt recovery requirements

of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a
reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery.

On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates
of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop
Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and
contemplates an approximately 25-mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and
southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for
Columbia of Ohio’s customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of
Ohio’s construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the
project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006.

On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to
increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery
of Columbia of Ohio’s deferred PIP balance over a twelve-month period plus the expected level of
arrears during each succeeding twelve-month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio
supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to extend the recovery period for its
deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative,
for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohio’s Supplement to its
Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be
billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45-day review process. The PUCO
took no action within the forty-five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed
revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills.
On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia
of Ohio’s application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On
February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of
$.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006.

On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the
Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to
increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay State’s request for a
performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure
replacement program.

On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a
performance based rate-making methodology (“PBR Plan”), which would freeze non-gas cost rates at
their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order
on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation
(“Investigation”) into the justness and reasonableness of
Columbia of Virginia’s current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary
Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a
general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the
VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation
until May 1, 2006.

Northern Indiana’s gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in
1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined
annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity
component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC
approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the
demand component filing. Northern Indiana’s GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the
sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas
supply portfolio cost to a market-based benchmark price.

Northern Indiana’s GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004
through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August
24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on
the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indiana’s GCA5.

Northern Indiana’s GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005
through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim
basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in
the second quarter of 2006.



ITEM 8.

On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement
Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the
Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The
new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indiana’s Choice program for
customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings
of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the
settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain
defined issues during the term of this agreement.

Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program “Winter Warmth” in the fourth quarter of
2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income
and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected
from ratepayers through a volumetric surcharge. The one-year pilot program, for calendar year
2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004.

Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar
year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005
extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final
order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006.
The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will
contribute $1.0 million of the total funding.

Electric Operations Related Matters

During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate
review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement.
The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will
receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225
million, for the minimum 49-month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate
moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a
specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated
based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1
million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were
recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation
of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in
the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional
control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for
Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana
Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired.

The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of
electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under “Day 1”, the
MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under “Day 2” the MISO dispatches
wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its
responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and
managing the day-ahead, real-time and financial transmission rights markets.

As part of Northern Indiana’s use of the MISO’s transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana
incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC-approved tariff, as well as administrative fees,
which relate to the MISO’s management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1
transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied
recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indiana’s rate moratorium. Day 2
charges consist of fuel-related and non-fuel-related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued
an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel-related Day 2 costs. The order denied
recovery or deferral of non-fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indiana’s rate moratorium, which
expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types
of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non-fuel. These particular charges, which amounted
to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indiana’s FAC-69 filing,
but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full
amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indiana’s FAC-69 filing,



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

but noted that this
particular category of charges was approved “subject to refund” and subject to the final order. On
February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through
the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the
charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power & Light, Vectren Energy
Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non-fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs
recorded as non-recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were
recorded as non-recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is
authorized to begin the deferral of all non-fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after
July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established
settlements process with market participants, MISO uses “resettlement” statements to make
adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be
anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed.

In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004,
the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is
located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the
Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC
seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and
conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006,
the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement
agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana
lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law.
Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light
of the City of Gary’s need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting
the facility.

On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and
Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indiana’s
retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in
this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final
order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs
incurred in August to December 2005 as described below.

On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource,
filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three-year arrangement pursuant
to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energy’s
generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana.
On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy
Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until
December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern
Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff
as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a
Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC
denied LaPorte County’s Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed
its Notice of Appeal of the IURC’s Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for
Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating
that it no longer is seeking approval of the three-year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that
Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power
purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1,
2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the
second quarter of 2006.

Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19,
2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial
Group agreed to support Northern Indiana’s recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its
FAC for the period August 9, 2005 through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions
include Northern Indiana’s agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008.

Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its
customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a
negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were
prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On

June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed
testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval
from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005.

Northern Indiana filed FAC-68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of
intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim
Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005.

Northern Indiana filed FAC-69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual
intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included
recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order
approving the FAC-69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost
recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The
recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to
refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above).

On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern
Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by
Northern Indiana to implement IDEM’s NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related
operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become
operational through an EERM. Under the IURC’s November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is
permitted to submit filings on a semi-annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the
EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indiana’s latest compliance plan with the
estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million
for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed
ECR-5 simultaneously with EER-2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those
components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating
expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR-5 and EER-2 on March
23, 2005. ECR-6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated
depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight
modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR-7 simultaneously with EER-3 for
capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed
in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through
December 31, 2005.

On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by
Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indiana’s service quality was not reasonably
adequate. While concluding that Northern Indiana’s service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled
that Northern Indiana must construct a backup
line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant.
Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern
Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURC’s order in this matter to the Indiana Court of
Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion
to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that
require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter.
On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana’s Motion to Stay the IURC’s April 13, 2005 ruling was denied.
Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with
Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with
growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana
Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further
proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand
would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order
under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a
response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter.

Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities

NiSource uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain risks in its business including
commodity price risk. NiSource accounts for its derivatives under SFAS No. 133. Refer to Note
1-S, “Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

Hedging Activities.

Many of the risk management programs in use by NiSource’s operating companies
qualify for hedge accounting. The cash flow hedge activity affecting other comprehensive income
for the years 2005 and 2004 was as follows:

(in millions, net of tax)



Net unrealized gains on derivatives qualifying as cash

$

93.7

Unrealized gains and losses on NiSource’s hedges were recorded as price risk management assets and
liabilities along with unrealized gains and losses on NiSource’s trading portfolio. The
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets include price risk management assets related to unrealized
gains and losses on hedges of $338.1 million and $200.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, of which $152.6 million and $51.7 million were included in “Current Assets”, $185.5
million and $148.3 million were included in “Other Assets.” Price risk management liabilities
related to unrealized gains and losses on hedges (including net option premiums) were $85.6 million
and $26.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, of which $63.4 million and $21.3
million were included in “Current Liabilities”, $22.2 million and $5.4 million were included in
“Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits.”

During 2005 and 2004, a gain of $0.4 million and $0.1 million, net-of-taxes respectively, was
recognized in earnings due to the change in value of certain derivative instruments primarily
representing time value. Additionally, all derivatives classified as a hedge are assessed for
hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or
classified as a regulatory asset or liability per SFAS No. 71 as appropriate. During 2005 and
2004, NiSource reclassified no amounts related to its cash flow hedges from other comprehensive
income to earnings, due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur.
It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow
hedge contracts will result in income recognition of amounts currently classified in other
comprehensive income of approximately $60.1 million, net-of-taxes.

Commodity Price Risk Programs.

Northern Indiana, Northern Indiana Fuel and Light, Kokomo Gas,
Northern Utilities, Columbia of Pennsylvania, Columbia of Kentucky and Columbia of Maryland use
NYMEX derivative contracts to minimize risk associated with gas price volatility. These derivative
hedging programs must be marked to fair value, but because these derivatives are used within the
framework of their gas cost recovery mechanism, regulatory assets or liabilities are recorded to
offset the change in the fair value of these derivatives. The Consolidated Balance Sheets
reflected $35.7 million and $0.6 million of price risk management assets associated with these
programs at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. In addition, the Consolidated
Balance Sheets reflected zero and $9.2 million of price risk management liabilities associated with
these programs at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.

Northern Indiana offers a PPS as an alternative to the standard gas cost recovery mechanism. This
service provides Northern Indiana customers with the opportunity to either lock in their gas cost
or place a cap on the total cost that could be charged for any future month specified. In order to
hedge the anticipated physical future purchases associated with these obligations, Northern Indiana
purchases NYMEX futures and options contracts that correspond to a fixed or capped price in the
associated delivery month. The NYMEX futures and options contracts
are designated as cash flow hedges. Columbia of Virginia started a program in April 2005 similar
to the Northern Indiana PPS, which allows non-jurisdictional customers the opportunity to lock in
their gas cost. The Consolidated Balance Sheets reflected $1.8 million and zero of price risk
management assets and $2.5 million and $5.3 million of price risk management liabilities associated
with these programs at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.



ITEM 8.

Northern Indiana also offers a DependaBill program to its customers as an alternative to the
standard tariff rate that is charged to residential customers. The program allows Northern Indiana
customers to fix their total monthly bill at a flat rate regardless of gas usage or commodity cost.
In order to hedge the anticipated physical purchases associated with these obligations, Northern
Indiana purchases fixed priced gas and the option to call on additional volumes that match the
anticipated delivery needs of the program and currently uses NYMEX futures and options contracts
for these hedge transactions. These derivatives are presently designated as cash flow hedges. The
Consolidated Balance Sheets reflected $1.6 million and zero of price risk management assets and
zero and $0.8 million of price risk management liabilities at December 31, 2005 and December 31,
2004, respectively, associated with the DependaBill program.

As part of the new MISO Day 2 initiative, Northern Indiana was allocated FTRs. These rights
protect the company against congestion losses due to the new MISO Day 2 activity. The FTRs do not
qualify for hedge accounting treatment, but since congestion costs are recoverable through the fuel
cost recovery mechanism the related gains and losses associated with these transactions are
recorded as a regulatory asset or liability, in accordance with SFAS No. 71. The Consolidated
Balance Sheets reflected $2.2 million of price risk management assets and $0.4 million of price
risk management liabilities at December 31, 2005.

For regulatory incentive purposes, Northern Indiana enters into purchase contracts at first of the
month prices that give counter parties the daily option to either sell an additional package of gas
at first of the month prices or recall the original volume to be delivered. Northern Indiana
charges a fee for this option. The changes in the fair value of these options are primarily due to
the changing expectations of the future intra-month volatility of gas prices. These written
options are derivative instruments, must be marked to fair value and do not meet the requirement
for hedge accounting treatment. However, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, Northern Indiana records
the related gains and losses associated with these transactions as a regulatory asset or liability.

For regulatory incentive purposes, Columbia of Kentucky, Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania
and Columbia of Maryland (collectively, the “Columbia LDCs”) enter into contracts that allow
counterparties the option to sell gas to Columbia LDCs at first of the month prices for a
particular month of delivery. Columbia LDCs charge the counterparties a fee for this option. The
changes in the fair value of the options are primarily due to the changing expectations of the
future intra-month volatility of gas prices. Columbia LDCs defer a portion of the change in the
fair value of the options as either a regulatory asset or liability in accordance with SFAS No. 71.
The remaining change is recognized currently in earnings. The Consolidated Balance Sheets
reflected $8.5 million and $4.6 million of price risk management liabilities associated with the
programs at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.

Columbia Energy Services has fixed price gas delivery commitments to three municipalities in the
United States. Columbia Energy Services entered into a forward purchase agreement with a gas
supplier, wherein the supplier will fulfill the delivery obligation requirements at a slight
premium to index. In order to hedge this anticipated future purchase of gas from the gas supplier,
Columbia Energy Services entered into commodity swaps priced at the locations designated for
physical delivery. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the anticipated purchases.
The Consolidated Balance Sheets reflected $266.7 million and $159.6 million of price risk
management assets associated with this program at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004,
respectively.

Interest Rate Risk Activities.

Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes
issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate
swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5
million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying
debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively.

NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics
of its outstanding long-term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance
entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million
with six counterparties having a 6 1/2-year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based
upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6-month BBA
LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at

the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May
15, 2009 at mid-market.

On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in
a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11-year term. NiSource Finance
will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount
based on U.S. 6-month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of
premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the
swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid-market.

On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in a
notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a
fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6-month BBA LIBOR plus
an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps.
These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004.

On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreement containing a
notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty
amounting to $8.2 million, which will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the
remaining term of the underlying debt.

As a result of the fixed-to-variable interest rate swap transactions referenced above, $1,160
million of NiSource Finance’s existing long-term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest
rates. These interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges. The effectiveness of the
interest rate swaps in offsetting the exposure to changes in the debt’s fair value is measured
using the short-cut method pursuant to SFAS No. 133. NiSource had no net gain or loss recognized
in earnings due to hedging ineffectiveness from prior years.

Marketing and Trading Activities.

The remaining operations of TPC primarily involve commercial and
industrial gas sales. As of December 31, 2005, all power trading contracts were settled. TPC may
enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with operating
Whiting Clean Energy, which may not qualify for hedge treatment as determined by SFAS No. 133.

In April 2003, the remaining gas-related activities (physical commodity sales to commercial and
industrial customers) that had been classified as derivatives were considered to fall within the
normal purchase and sale exception under SFAS No. 133. Therefore, all gas-related derivatives used
to offset the physical obligations necessary to fulfill these commodity sales were designated as
cash flow hedges. The Consolidated Balance Sheets reflected $68.0 million and $10.5 million of
price risk management assets and $70.9 million and $18.3 million of price risk management
liabilities associated with this program at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.

The fair market values of NiSource’s power trading assets and liabilities were zero at December 31,
2005 and $8.8 million and $11.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004.

Equity Investment Subsidiaries

Certain investments of NiSource are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Income
and losses are reflected in other revenues on NiSource’s Statements of Consolidated Income. All
investments shown as limited partnerships are limited partnership interests.

Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50% of Millennium, it does not
exert control over the partnership and therefore did not consolidate the Millennium project
entities. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE
Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%),
and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time
Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to
redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In
late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading
interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution
from Columbia Atlantic Trading to

DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbia’s ownership will be at 47.5% and
the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

NiSource’s goodwill of $3,677.3 and $3,687.2 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
pertains primarily to the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. NiSource has aggregated the
subsidiaries related to the acquisition of Columbia into two distinct reporting units, one within
the Gas Distribution Operations segment and one within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
segment, for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment. NiSource performs its annual
impairment test of goodwill every June 30.

In the quarter ended June 30, 2005, NiSource performed its annual impairment test of goodwill
associated with the purchases of Columbia, Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas. The
results of the June 30, 2005 impairment test indicated that no impairment charge was required for
the goodwill related to the purchase of Columbia or Northern Indiana Fuel and Light, and that an
impairment charge of $10.9 million was required for goodwill related to the purchase of Kokomo Gas.
This impairment charge was recorded in June 2005 and is reflected in operating expenses as an
“Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets” on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Factors
contributing to this charge were increased income that reduced the “regulatory earnings bank” and
limitations on future operating income growth.

Intangible assets apart from goodwill, consisting of franchise rights, were identified as part of
the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisitions of Bay State, Northern Utilities,
which is a subsidiary of Bay State, and Granite, all of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of
NiSource. These amounts were $449.3 million and $462.9 million, net of amortization of $96.1
million and $82.5 million, at December 31, 2005, and 2004, respectively, and are being amortized
over forty years from the date of acquisition. NiSource had approximately $46.5 million and $57.4
million of other intangible assets recorded at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which
reflected the
additional minimum liability associated with the unrecognized service cost of the pension plans
pursuant to SFAS No. 87. In the fourth quarter 2005, Bay State tested for impairment its
intangible assets associated with its rate case proceedings and found that no impairment existed.
The intangible assets at December 31, 2005 associated with Bay State were $447.6 million.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

NiSource provides defined contribution plans and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans
that cover its employees. Benefits under the defined benefit retirement plans reflect the
employees’ compensation, years of service and age at retirement. Additionally, NiSource provides
health care and life insurance benefits for certain



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

retired employees. The majority of employees
may become eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement age while working for NiSource.
The expected cost of such benefits is accrued during the employees’ years of service. Current
rates of rate-regulated companies include postretirement benefit costs on an accrual basis,
including amortization of the regulatory assets that arose prior to inclusion of these costs in
rates. For most plans, cash contributions are remitted to grantor trusts. NiSource uses September
30 as its measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans.

NiSource employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income
investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded
status, and asset class volatility. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of
equity and fixed income investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S.
and non-U.S. stocks, as well as growth, value, small and large capitalizations. Other assets such
as private equity and hedge funds are used judiciously to enhance long-term returns while improving
portfolio diversification. Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and
timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market
value of the underlying assets. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis
through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic
asset/liability studies.

The most important component of an investment strategy is the portfolio asset mix, or the
allocation between the various classes of securities available to the pension plan for investment
purposes. The asset mix and acceptable minimum and maximum ranges established represents a
long-term view and are as follows:

NiSource employs a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and
rebalancing in determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are
studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are analyzed to
ensure that they are consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with
higher volatility generate greater return over the long run. Current market factors such as
inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are
determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and
appropriateness.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource pension fund assets earned a return of 14.7% for the plan year ended September 30, 2005
and 12.8% for the plan year ended September 30, 2004. However, the discount rate used to measure
the accumulated benefit obligation has decreased over the past two years, which slightly offset the
fair-value increase in the pension assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, NiSource adjusted its
minimum pension liability at September 30, 2005 and 2004. At September 30, 2005, NiSource increased
the pension liability by approximately $27 million due to a reduction in the discount rate from
6.0% to 5.5% used to determine the pension benefit obligation. NiSource expects pension expense
for 2006 to decrease approximately $15.7 million and other post-retirement benefits expense to
decrease approximately $4.4 million from the amounts recognized in 2005 due to the return on plan
assets experienced, changes in the various benefit plans and a reduction in employees. In
addition, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $7.1 million to its pension plans
and approximately $54.2 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2006.

During the third quarter of 2005 NiSource recognized a $16.2 million curtailment for pension and
other postretirement benefits and a $2.2 million cost for special termination benefits in
connection with business processes outsourced under the IBM agreement. Of this amount,
approximately $0.4 million was recorded as a regulatory asset per SFAS No. 71 and $18.0 million was
charged to restructuring expense.

Asset Retirement Obligations

NiSource has accounted for retirement obligations on its assets since January 1, 2003 with the
adoption of SFAS No. 143. In the fourth quarter 2005, NiSource adopted the provisions of FIN 47,
which broadened the scope of SFAS No. 143 to include contingent asset retirement obligations and it
also provided additional guidance for the measurement of the asset retirement liabilities. This
accounting standard and the related interpretation requires entities to record the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the
liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized
cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate-regulated subsidiaries
defer the difference between the amount recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount
collected in rates as required pursuant to SFAS No. 71 for those amounts it has collected in rates
or expects to collect in future rates.

Changes in NiSource’s liability for asset retirement obligations for the years 2005 and 2004 are
presented in the table below:

NiSource adopted the provisions of FIN 47 on December 31, 2005, and as a result, an additional
asset retirement obligation liability of $110.0 million and a cumulative loss due to a change
in accounting principle of $0.3 million was recognized. NiSource also capitalized $30.1
million in additions to plant assets, net of accumulated amortization, and increased
regulatory assets and decreased regulatory liabilities for costs of removal amounting to $24.3
million and $55.1 million, respectively. NiSource believes that the amounts recognized as
regulatory assets will be recoverable in future rates. Had NiSource included these asset
retirement obligations on its balance sheet prior to adopting FIN 47, the additional reported
asset retirement obligation liability would have been approximately $113 million and $108
million at December 31, 2004 and January 1, 2004, respectively.

As a result of adopting FIN 47, NiSource has recognized asset retirement obligations associated
with various obligations including costs to remove and dispose of certain construction
materials located within many of NiSource’s facilities, certain costs to retire pipeline,
removal costs for certain underground storage tanks, removal of certain
pipelines known to contain a high level of PCB contamination and closure costs for certain sites
including ash ponds, solid waste management units and a landfill, as well as some other nominal
asset retirement obligations. NiSource recognizes that there are obligations to incur significant
costs to retire wells associated with gas storage operations, however, these assets are land assets
with indeterminable lives. Additionally, NiSource has a significant obligation associated with the
decommissioning of its two hydro facilities located in Indiana. However, these assets have an
indeterminate life and no asset retirement obligation has been recorded.

Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and
collected in the service rates of the rate-regulated subsidiaries, did not meet the definition
of an asset retirement obligation pursuant to SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47. The amount of the
other costs of removal reflected as a component of NiSource’s accumulated



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

depreciation and
amortization was approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004 based on rates for
estimated removal costs embedded in composite depreciation rates. Upon the adoption of SFAS
No. 143 on January 31, 2003, NiSource reclassified its cost of removal from accumulated
depreciation to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004, NiSource recognized accretion
expense of $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The asset retirement obligations liability
totaled $119.8 million and $9.3 million at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.
NiSource anticipates that the depreciation and accretion amounts to be recognized in 2006
associated with its asset retirement obligation assets and liabilities will be $2.8 million and
$7.5 million, respectively, and will primarily be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability
pursuant to SFAS No. 71.

Authorized Classes of Cumulative Preferred and Preference Stocks

NiSource has 20,000,000 authorized shares of Preferred with a $0.01 par value, of which 4,000,000
shares are designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares and are reserved for issuance
pursuant to the Share Purchase Rights Plan described in Note 12-C, “Shareholder Rights Plan,” in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The authorized classes of par value and no par value cumulative preferred and preference stocks of
Northern Indiana are as follows: 2,400,000 shares of Cumulative Preferred with a $100 par value;
3,000,000 shares of Cumulative Preferred with no par value; 2,000,000 shares of Cumulative
Preference with a $50 par value (none outstanding); and 3,000,000 shares of Cumulative Preference
with no par value (none outstanding).

The preferred stockholders of Northern Indiana have no voting rights, except in the event of
default on the payment of four consecutive quarterly dividends, or as required by Indiana law to
authorize additional preferred shares, or by the Articles of Incorporation in the event of certain
merger transactions.

The redemption prices at December 31, 2005, for the cumulative preferred stock, which is redeemable

B. Corporate PIES Remarketing.

In February 2003, NiSource issued approximately 13.1 million shares
of common stock associated with the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component
of the Corporate PIES. Concurrently with the settlement of the forward agreements, NiSource
remarketed the underlying debentures, due February 19, 2005, and reset the interest rate to 4.25%.
NiSource received net proceeds of $344.1 million from the remarketing in satisfaction of the
Corporate PIES holders’ obligation under the forward equity agreements. As a result of the
transaction, the underlying subsidiary trust was dissolved.

C. Shareholder Rights Plan.

NiSource’s Board has adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan, pursuant to
which one right accompanies each share of common stock. Each right, when exercisable, would
initially entitle the holder to purchase from NiSource one one-hundredth of a share of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock, with $0.01 par value, at a price of $60 per one one-hundredth
of a share. In certain circumstances, if an acquirer obtained 25% of NiSource’s outstanding
shares, or merged into NiSource or merged NiSource into the acquirer, the rights would entitle the
holders to purchase NiSource’s or the acquirer’s common shares for one-half of the market price.
The rights will not dilute NiSource’s common stock nor affect earnings per share unless they become
exercisable for common stock. The plan was not adopted in response to any specific attempt to
acquire control of NiSource. The rights are not currently exercisable.

D. Northern Indiana Dividend Restriction.

So long as any shares of Northern Indiana’s cumulative
preferred stock are outstanding, no cash dividends shall be paid or declared on its common stock in
excess of 75% of the net income available for the preceding calendar year, unless the aggregate of
the capital applicable to stocks subordinate as to assets and dividends to the cumulative preferred
stock plus the surplus, after giving effect to such common stock dividends, would equal or exceed
25% of the sum of all obligations evidenced by bonds, notes, debentures or other securities, plus
the total capital and surplus. At December 31, 2005, the sum of the capital applicable to stocks
subordinate to the cumulative preferred stock plus the surplus was equal to 55% of the total
capitalization including surplus.

E. Common Stock Dividend.

Holders of shares of NiSource’s common stock are entitled to receive
dividends when, as and if declared by the Board out of funds legally available. The policy of the
Board has been to declare cash dividends on a quarterly basis payable on or about the 20th day of
February, May, August and November. Beginning with the November 2003 dividend, NiSource reduced
its annual dividend to $0.92 per share from $1.16 per share. NiSource paid quarterly common
dividends totaling $0.92 per share for the 2005 year. At its January 6, 2006 meeting, the Board
declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.23 per share, payable on February 20, 2006 to holders of
record on January 31, 2006.

13.

Long-Term Incentive Plans

NiSource currently issues long-term incentive grants to key management employees under a long-term
incentive plan approved by stockholders on April 13, 1994 (1994 Plan). The 1994 Plan, as amended
and restated, permits the following types of grants, separately or in combination: nonqualified
stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights,
performance units, contingent stock awards and dividend equivalents payable on grants of options,
performance units and contingent stock awards. Under the plan, each option has a maximum term of
ten years from the date of grant. NiSource has traditionally awarded stock options to
employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant. For stock
options granted during January 2005, NiSource awarded stock options that vested immediately, but
included a one-year exercise restriction. Stock appreciation rights may be granted only in tandem
with stock options on a one-for-one basis and are payable in cash, common stock, or a combination
thereof. In addition, NiSource currently has non-qualified option grants outstanding and vested
which were granted under a 1988 long-term incentive plan.

At the annual meeting of stockholders held on May 10, 2005, the company’s stockholders approved
proposed amendments to the 1994 Plan. The amendments (i) increased the maximum number of shares of
NiSource common stock that may be subject to awards from 21 million to 43 million and (ii) extended
the period during which awards could be granted to May 10, 2015 and extended the term of the plan
until all the awards have been satisfied by either issuance of stock or the payment of cash. At
December 31, 2005, there were 25,470,023 shares reserved for future awards under the amended and
restated 1994 Plan.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

NiSource has granted restricted stock awards, which are restricted as to transfer and are subject
to forfeiture for specific periods from the date of grant and will vest over periods from one year
or more. If a participant’s employment is terminated prior to vesting other than by reason of
death, disability or retirement, restricted shares are forfeited. However, awards may vest upon
death, disability, or upon a change of control or retirement. There were 451,563 restricted shares
outstanding at December 31, 2005, which were not a part of the time accelerated restricted stock
award plan described below.

In January 2003 and 2004, NiSource awarded restricted shares and restricted stock units that
contain provisions for time accelerated vesting to key executives. These awards of restricted stock
or restricted stock units generally vest over a period of six years or, in the case of restricted
stock units at age 62 if an employee would become age 62 within six years, but not less than three
years. If certain predetermined criteria involving measures of total shareholder return are met,
as measured at the end of the third year after the grant date, the awards vest at the end of the
third year. At December 31, 2005, NiSource had 1,152,169 awards outstanding which contain the time
accelerated provisions. The total shareholder return measures established for the awards granted in
2003 and 2004 were not met as of December 31, 2005, and those grants will not have an accelerated
vesting period.

For 2006, NiSource’s Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent executives additional
grants of options, restricted or contingent shares.

The Amended and Restated Non-employee Director Stock Incentive Plan, which was approved by the
Board and stockholders at the 2003 annual meeting, provides for the issuance of up to 500,000
shares of common stock to non-employee directors. The Plan provides for awards of common stock,
which vest in 20% increments per year, with full vesting after five years. The Plan permits the
granting of restricted stock units and allows for the award of nonqualified stock options, subject
to immediate vesting in the event of the director’s death or disability, or a change in control of
NiSource. If a director’s service on the Board is terminated for any reason other than retirement
at or after age seventy, death or disability, any shares of common stock not vested as of the date
of termination are forfeited. As of December 31, 2005, 89,860 restricted shares and 91,263
restricted stock units had been issued under the Plan.

The long-term incentive plans have been accounted for using the intrinsic value method under APB
No. 25 through December 31, 2005. The compensation cost that was charged against operating income
for share-based awards was $6.8 million, $8.0 million and $12.9 million for years ended December
31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Option grants are granted with an exercise price equal to
the average of the high and low market price on the day of the grant.

Short-Term Borrowings

On November 30, 2005, NiSource Finance entered into a new $300 million 9-month revolving credit
agreement with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein LLC. During March 2005, NiSource Finance obtained a
new $1.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays
Capital. The new facility replaced an expiring $500 million 364-day credit facility, as well as a
$750 million three-year credit facility that would have expired in March 2007. As of December 31,
2005, NiSource had $25.5 million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding under the five-year
revolving credit facility.

The year over year increase in short-term borrowings reflects a combination of factors. First, the
short-term debt balances at December 31, 2004 were unusually low as a result of financing
activities in November 2004. NiSource issued a $450 million floating rate note in the fourth
quarter of 2004 and used the proceeds to redeem $250 million floating rate notes due in May 2005.
The remaining $200 million was used to repay a portion of NiSource’s short-term borrowings. Also
in the fourth quarter of 2004, NiSource issued approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock
upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSource’s

holders’ obligation under the stock purchase contracts, which was used to pay

increase in working capital requirements to fund the cost of gas placed in storage, the cost of gas
flowing directly to our customers and the related increase in accounts receivable.

Long-Term Debt

NiSource Finance is a wholly-owned, consolidated finance subsidiary of NiSource that engages in
financing activities to raise funds for the business operations of NiSource and its subsidiaries.
NiSource Finance was incorporated in February 2000 under the laws of the state of Indiana.
NiSource Finance’s obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NiSource.

On November 29, 2005, Columbia redeemed $1.1 billion of its senior unsecured notes that became
callable on November 28, 2005 having an average interest rate of 7.34%. On November 28, 2005,
Columbia redeemed $281.5 million of its senior unsecured notes with an average interest rate of
6.80%. The associated charges included an $86 million non-cash charge relating to the write-off of
the unamortized portion of a fair market value adjustment made at the time of the NiSource Columbia
merger, an $8 million non-cash charge associated with the unamortized portion of swap termination
charges, and a $14 million cash charge for call premiums, all of which were charged to loss on
early extinguishment of long-term debt.

On November 28, 2005, NiSource Finance issued, in the private placement market, $900 million in
unregistered senior unsecured notes in four tranches: $315 million of 7-year notes at a coupon rate
of 5.21%; $230 million of 10-year notes at a coupon rate of 5.36%; $90 million of 11-year notes at
a coupon rate of 5.41%; and $265 million of 20-year notes at a coupon rate of 5.89%. The proceeds,
along with other funding sources, were used to refinance the above mentioned Columbia senior
unsecured notes.

On September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of 5.25% 12-year unsecured notes that
mature September 15, 2017 and $550 million of 5.45% 15-year unsecured notes that mature September
15, 2020. The proceeds were used in part to redeem $900 million of NiSource Finance notes due
November 15, 2005. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes, NiSource
Finance settled $900 million of forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to
NiSource’s swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of
the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively.

In November 2004, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of floating rate notes that will mature on
November 23, 2009, and are callable on or after November 23, 2006. The notes will bear interest at
3-month LIBOR plus a spread of 57 basis points, reset quarterly. NiSource Finance used $250
million of the proceeds to fund the early redemption
of floating rate notes during December 2004 that would have become due in May 2005. The remaining
$200 million in proceeds was used to repay a portion of the company’s short-term debt.

are being amortized. These premiums are not earning a return during the recovery period.

Of NiSource’s $5,271.2 million of long-term debt at December 31, 2005, $225 million was issued by
NiSource’s affiliate, Capital Markets. The financial obligations of Capital Markets are subject to
a Support Agreement between NiSource and Capital Markets, under which NiSource has committed to
make payments of interest and principal on
Capital Market’s obligations in the event of a failure to pay by Capital Markets. Under the terms
of the Support Agreement, in addition to the cash flow of cash dividends paid to NiSource by any of
its consolidated subsidiaries, the assets of NiSource, other than the stock and assets of Northern
Indiana, are available as recourse for the benefit of Capital Market’s creditors. The carrying
value of the assets of NiSource, other than the assets of Northern Indiana, was $13.6 billion at
December 31, 2005.

NiSource Finance has entered into interest rate swap agreements for $1,160 million of its
outstanding long-term debt. The effect of these agreements is to modify the interest rate
characteristics of a portion of their respective long-term debt from fixed to variable. Refer to
Note 6, “Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information regarding interest rate swaps.

NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under both its five-year revolving credit facility
and its nine-month revolving credit agreement. NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization
ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of December 31, 2005, NiSource was in compliance with this
financial covenant under both agreements.

NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such
covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSource’s assets,
generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting
security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSource’s consolidated net
tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and/or transfer of
NiSource’s assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit
facilities also include a cross-default provision, which triggers an event of default under the
credit facility in the event of any uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of
NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more.

NiSource’s bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However,
NiSource’s bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured
payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on
NiSource’s assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests,
preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of
NiSource’s consolidated net tangible assets.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of
financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value:

Investments.

Where feasible, the fair value of investments is estimated based on market prices for
those or similar investments.

Long-term Debt and Preferred Stock.

The fair values of these securities are estimated based on the
quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the rates offered for securities of the
same remaining maturities. Certain premium costs associated with the early settlement of long-term
debt are not taken into consideration in determining fair value.

Sale of Trade Accounts Receivable.

On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to
sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CORC, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated
May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts
receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts
receivable under the agreement. The agreement has a scheduled expiration date of May 12, 2006, and
can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, $175 million of
accounts receivable had been sold by CORC.

Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping
and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives
a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services.

On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of
its trade receivables, as they originate, to NRC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana.
NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest
in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200
million of accounts receivable under the agreement. NRC’s agreement with the commercial paper
conduit has a scheduled expiration date of December 22, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed
to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, NRC had sold $200 million of accounts receivable.
Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indiana’s debt
rating falls below BBB- or Baa3 at Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s, respectively.

Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and
cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which
provides adequate compensation, for such services.

NiSource’s accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting based upon the conditions met
in SFAS No. 140. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor
and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or
other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under both
agreements.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

A. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities.

NiSource expects that approximately $638.2
million will be expended for construction and other investment purposes during 2006.

B. Assets Under Lien.

Substantially all of Columbia Transmission properties have been pledged to
Columbia as security for debt owed by Columbia Transmission to Columbia. All of the debt that was
secured by this lien has been paid and NiSource is in the process of having this lien released.

C. Guarantees and Indemnities.

As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries
enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on
behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees
and stand-by letters of credit.
These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise
attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient
credit to accomplish the subsidiaries’ intended commercial purposes. The total commercial
commitments in existence at December 31, 2005 and the years in which they expire were:

Guarantees of Subsidiaries Debt.

NiSource has guaranteed the payment of $5.0 billion of debt for
various wholly-owned subsidiaries including Whiting Leasing, NiSource Finance, and through a
support agreement, Capital Markets. Other than debt associated with the former PEI subsidiaries
that were sold, the debt is reflected on NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The subsidiaries
are required to comply with certain financial covenants under the debt indenture and in the event
of default, NiSource would be obligated to pay the debt’s principal and related interest. NiSource
does not anticipate its subsidiaries will have any difficulty maintaining compliance.

Guarantees Supporting Commodity Transactions of Subsidiaries.

NiSource has issued guarantees,
which support up to approximately $1.1 billion of commodity-related payments for its current
subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and trading and those satisfying requirements under
forward gas sales agreements of current and former subsidiaries. These guarantees were provided to
counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and
electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity-related contracts subject to
these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of February
28, 2006, $60.1 million of the guarantees related to CNR have expired.

Lines and Letters of Credit.

NiSource Finance also maintains lines of credit with financial
institutions. At December 31, 2005, the amount outstanding under the lines of credit and
guaranteed by NiSource amounted to $898.0 million. NiSource has also issued stand-by letters of
credit of approximately $101.6 million through financial institutions for the benefit of third
parties that have extended credit to certain subsidiaries. If a subsidiary does not pay amounts
when due under covered contracts, the beneficiary may present its claim for payment to the
financial institution, which will in turn request payment from NiSource.

Other Guarantees or Obligations.

After the October 20, 2003 sale of six subsidiaries, PEI
continues to own Whiting Clean Energy. The total of the outstanding debt guaranteed for Whiting
Clean Energy at December 31,



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

2005 was $321.4 million, of which approximately $298.6 million of debt
related to Whiting Clean Energy was included in NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource
had retained financial guarantees of $140.6 million of debt outstanding, which related to three of
the PEI projects. These guarantees were satisfied in the third quarter of 2005 when the
outstanding debt was refinanced by the buyer of those subsidiaries, thus relieving NiSource of its
guaranties of such debt. The fair value of those financial guarantees, $10.5 million, was
recognized as income from discontinued operations in the third quarter 2005.

As part of PEI’s sale to Private Power in 2003, NiSource retained certain obligations with respect
to the former PEI subsidiaries. NiSource retained operational guarantees related to environmental
compliance, inventory balances, employee relations, and a contingent obligation to Private Power
that could be triggered if U.S. Steel exercised a purchase option under its agreement with a former
PEI subsidiary. At the time of the sale, NiSource allocated $0.6 million to this contingent option
obligation. However, in November 2005, U.S. Steel Gary Works announced its intent to exercise the
purchase option. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2005, NiSource accrued an additional $7.4
million for the probable settlement of this contingent obligation.

Off Balance Sheet Items.

NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $85.0
million, which guarantee performance of the seller’s covenants, agreements, obligations,
liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the
purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to
perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned
guarantees is remote.

NiSource has issued guarantees, which support up to approximately $1.1 billion of commodity-related
payments for its current and former subsidiaries. Refer to the discussion above in this Note 17-C,
“Guarantees and Indemnities — Guarantees Supporting Commodity Transactions of Subsidiaries” for
additional information.

NiSource retained liabilities related to the CER forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia for
guarantees of the forward sales and for indemnity agreements with respect to surety bonds backing
the forward sales. The guarantees, surety bonds and associated indemnity agreements remained in
place subsequent to the closing of the CER sale and declined over time as volumes were delivered in
satisfaction of the contractual obligations, that were completed in February 2006. Columbia was
the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under these forward gas sales
agreements. In the third quarter of 2005, these bonds expired.

Immediately after the close of the sale in August 2003, Triana owned approximately 1.1 Tcf of
proved reserves, and was capitalized with $330 million, approximately $200 million of which was
provided as initial equity by MSCP and the remainder of which is provided as part of a $500 million
revolving credit facility. NiSource believed that the combination of Triana’s proved reserves,
sufficient capitalization, and access to the credit facility, adequately offset any losses that
could have been incurred by NiSource due to Triana’s non-performance under the Mahonia agreements.
Accordingly, NiSource did not recognize a liability related to the retention of the Mahonia
guarantees subsequent to the sale.

D. Other Legal Proceedings.

In the normal course of its business, NiSource and its subsidiaries
have been named as defendants in various legal proceedings. In the opinion of management, the
ultimate disposition of these currently asserted claims will not have a material adverse impact on
NiSource’s consolidated financial position.

E. Income Tax Examinations.

NiSource records liabilities for potential income tax assessments.
The accruals relate to tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on what
management believes will be the ultimate resolution of these positions. These liabilities may be
affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, or the expiration of the
statute of limitations. NiSource is under continuous examination by the IRS. The IRS has
completed its audits through tax year 2002. Years through 1998 have been settled and are closed to
further assessment. For years 1999 and 2000, NiSource disagreed with three adjustments proposed by
the IRS and filed a protest of those issues with the IRS Appeals Division. The opening Appeals
conference was held in March 2005 and negotiations were conducted throughout most of the remainder
of the year. While concessions were made by both NiSource and the IRS during the Appeals process,
the parties were unable to reach agreement on the two most significant issues: deductibility of
certain costs associated with the Columbia acquisition and deductions related to the abandonment of
Wells LNG development costs at Granite State Gas. NiSource intends to file a petition with the Tax
Court with respect to these two issues during 2006. The audit of NiSource’s 2001 and



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

federal income tax returns was completed on June 1, 2005. With the exception of carryover
adjustments related to the two unagreed issues from the 1999-2000 audit discussed above, NiSource
agreed with all proposed IRS adjustments and has paid the resultant tax liability. The audit of
tax years 2003 and 2004 commenced on September 27, 2005.

F.

Environmental Matters.

General.

The operations of NiSource are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations intended to protect the public health and the environment. Such
environmental laws and regulations affect operations as they relate to impacts on air, water and
land.

Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United
States and worldwide to reduce so-called “greenhouse gases” such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of
burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage
in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently
a participant in the United States EPA’s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and
participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas
emissions.

Gas Distribution Operations.

Several Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are potentially
responsible parties at waste disposal sites under the CERCLA (commonly known as Superfund) and
similar state laws, as well as at MGP sites, which such subsidiaries, or their corporate
predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries may be
required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution
Operations subsidiaries have responsibility for corrective action under the RCRA for closure and
clean-up costs associated with underground storage tanks, under the Toxic Substances Control Act
for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls, and for mercury releases. The final costs of clean up
have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean up proceed and as additional
information becomes available reserves are adjusted.

A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution
Operations subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has
identified 85 such sites and initial investigations have been conducted at 52 sites. Additional
investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 44 sites and remedial measures
have been implemented or completed at 28 sites. This effort includes the sites contained in the
January 2004 agreement entered into by the IDEM, Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas, and other Indiana
utilities under the Indiana Voluntary Remediation Program. Only those site investigation,
characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered “probable
and reasonably estimable” under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable,
reserves will be adjusted. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent
environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this
time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management
expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more
facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the
entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the SEC’s SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5 and SOP
96-1. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve of approximately $58.0 million has been recorded to cover
probable environmental response actions.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations.

Columbia Transmission continues to conduct
characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order
by Consent. The program pursuant to the Administrative Order by Consent covers approximately 245
facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement
stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization has been performed at all
sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for
approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at
the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at most
of the 245 facilities. As of December 31, 2005, the remaining environmental liability recorded on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Columbia Transmission was approximately $2.1 million.

Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are potentially responsible parties at several waste
disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws. The potential liability is believed to be de
minimis. However, the final allocation

of clean-up costs has yet to be determined. As site
investigations and clean-ups proceed and as additional information becomes available reserves will
be adjusted.

The EPA has begun implementing the Particulate Matter and Ozone National Ambient Air Quality
Standards it revised in July 1997. As a result, the EPA has designated areas not attaining the
standards. The Clean Air Act provides for a process that would provide for promulgation of rules
specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and necessary controls to be implemented within
designated areas over the next few years. On December 20, 2005, EPA announced a proposed revision
to the particulate matter NAAQS that would increase the stringency of the current fine particulate
(PM2.5) standard and add a new standard for inhalable coarse particulate (particulate matter
between 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter). The proposal would also revoke the current PM10 NAAQS
except in areas with a population of 100,000 or more with monitors violating the current standard.
In a separate but related action, EPA proposed to amend its national ambient air quality monitoring
requirements, including those for particulate matter that would include a design for a PM10-2.5
monitoring network necessary to establish attainment of the proposed new NAAQS. EPA must issue
final standards by September 27, 2006.

Implementation of the Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards may
require imposition of additional controls on engines and turbines but is not reasonably estimable
at this point. In addition, the EPA has reissued the portion of the NOx SIP Call regulation
(dealing with regional ozone transport), which is applicable to certain pipeline engines. The
resulting rules require additional reductions in NOx emissions from
reciprocating engines and turbines at pipeline compressor stations (including compressor stations
owned by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf). The EPA and state regulatory authorities are in
the process of setting final implementation requirements. States have proposed and in some
instances finalized new NOx emission requirements that may be applicable to pipeline compressor
station engines and turbines. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new
limits may be significant but are dependent upon the ultimate control program established by the
targeted states and the EPA, and currently are not reasonably estimable. To date finalized rules
have had minimal impact, but additional rules are expected. NiSource will continue to closely
monitor developments in this area.

Columbia Transmission discovered and notified the State of West Virginia of compliance issues
associated with turbine operations at two of its facilities. The State of West Virginia has not
responded to the disclosure or the adequacy of Columbia Transmission’s actions.

Electric Operations.

Air.

In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply
with the EPA’s NOx SIP call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to
reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional
transport of ozone. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules was required by May
31, 2004. To comply with the rule, Northern Indiana developed a NOx compliance plan, which
included the installation of Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its
active generating stations and is currently in compliance with the NOx limits. In implementing the
NOx compliance plan; Northern Indiana has expended approximately $251 million as of December 31,
2005. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $306 million upon completion
of the plan. Actual costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand and
resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential
need for additional control technology.

On April 15, 2004, the EPA finalized the 8-hour ozone non-attainment area designations. After
designation, the Clean Air Act provides for a process for promulgation of rules specifying a
compliance level, compliance deadline, and necessary controls to be implemented within designated
areas over the next few years. Resulting state rules could require additional reductions in NOx
emissions from coal-fired boilers including Northern Indiana’s electric generating stations. Until
the rules are promulgated, the potential impact on Northern Indiana is uncertain. On November 4,
2005 the Indiana governor announced plans to petition EPA in early 2006 to designate Lake and
Porter counties attainment for 8-hour ozone based on monitored improvements in local air quality.
If approved by the EPA, redesignation would negate the need for new rules for the two counties.
Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor developments in this area.

On June 28 and 29, 2004, the EPA responded to the states’ initial recommendations for the EPA
designation of areas meeting and not meeting the NAAQS for fine particles. (Fine particles are
those less than or equal to 2.5

.) The EPA’s PM

2.5

nonattainment designations were announced on
December 17, 2004, and published in the Federal Register on January 5, 2005. The designations
became effective on April 5, 2005. Indiana has disputed some of the June 2004, EPA designation
recommendations and submitted final 2004 monitoring data on February 17, 2005, for EPA
re-evaluation of the disputed areas. On March 7, 2005, the Indiana Attorney General filed a legal
action on behalf of the IDEM asking that all but three areas (none of these three areas are in
Northern Indiana’s service territory) be removed from the EPA’s nonattainment list. The EPA is
expected to finalize by late 2006, an implementation rule detailing state obligations to bring the
nonattainment areas into attainment with the PM

2.5

NAAQS. Indiana and other states will
be required to finalize state rulemaking by April 2008 that specify emissions reductions consistent
with the final EPA implementation rule to bring the designated areas into attainment by as early as
April 2010.

On December 20, 2005 EPA announced a proposed revision to the particulate matter NAAQS that would
increase the stringency of the current fine particulate (PM

2.5

) standard and add a new
standard for inhalable coarse particulate (particulate matter between 10 and 2.5 microns in
diameter). The proposal would also revoke the current PM


NAAQS except in areas with a
population of 100,000 or more with monitors violating the current standard. In a separate but
related action, the EPA proposed to amend its national ambient air quality monitoring requirements,
including those for particulate matter that would include a design for a PM

10-2.5

monitoring network necessary to establish attainment of the proposed
new NAAQS. The EPA must issue
final standards by September 27, 2006. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor
developments in this area that could impact the emission control
requirements for coal-fired boilers including Northern Indiana’s electric generating stations.

In late 1999 the EPA initiated a New Source Review enforcement action against several industries
including the electric utility industry concerning rule interpretations that have been the subject
of recent (prospective) reform regulations. Northern Indiana has received and responded to the EPA
information requests on this subject, most recently in
June 2002. The EPA issued an NOV to Northern
Indiana on September 29, 2004, for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act and the SIP.
Specifically, the NOV alleges that modifications were made to certain boiler units at the Michigan
City, Schahfer, and Bailly Generating Stations between the years of 1985 and 1995 without obtaining
appropriate air permits for the modifications. Northern Indiana has held meetings with the EPA to
discuss the violations alleged in the NOV but is unable, at this time, to predict the timing or
likely outcome of this EPA action.

On March 10, 2005, the EPA issued the CAIR final regulations. The rule establishes phased
reductions of NOx and SO2 from 28 Eastern States, including Indiana electric utilities, by
establishing an annual emissions cap for NOx and SO2 and an additional cap on NOx emissions during
the ozone control season. Phase I reductions would be required by January 2009 and January 2010
for NOx and SO2, respectively. Phase II reductions for both NOx and SO2 would be required by
January 2015. Emission trading programs would be established to meet the emission caps. As an
affected state, Indiana is required to initiate a state rule making, for submittal to the EPA by
September 11, 2006, creating rules, or a SIP, detailing how it will implement the federal rule and
meet the emission caps. In June 2005, Indiana initiated the process to develop a state rule to
implement the EPA CAIR. The final form of the state rule will determine whether Northern Indiana
and other utilities in the state will be able to participate in the EPA’s emission trading programs
and impact the level of control required for each unit. During December 2005, Indiana indicated
that the expected state rule would largely conform to the final EPA CAIR regulations, which would
make the state eligible for a six-month extension of the submittal deadline. Accordingly, Indiana
anticipates that an additional six months will be available to finalize the state CAIR rule.
Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor developments in this area and cannot accurately
estimate the timing or cost of emission controls at this time.

On March 15, 2005, the EPA issued the CAMR, that will require mercury emissions reductions from
electric power generating stations. The rule establishes a two-phased reduction of mercury from
Indiana electric utilities by establishing a cap-and-trade program with a state-wide annual cap on
emissions. The first phase begins in 2010, a second phase in 2018, designed to achieve about a 70%
reduction in utility emissions of mercury. Emission trading programs could be established to
assist compliance with these emission caps. In June 2005, Indiana initiated the state process to
develop a state rule to implement the EPA’s CAMR. In the June 2005 request for comments, Indiana
solicited comments on both the EPA CAMR approach and on an alternative mercury reduction program
proposed by the Hoosier Environmental Council. The alternate plan considered a significantly
larger emission reduction (up to 90%) requirement and an implementation schedule of 2008 to 2010.
The final form of the state rule implementing the CAMR will determine Northern Indiana’s ability to
participate in the federal trading program and

impact the level of control required for each unit.
Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor developments in this area and cannot accurately
estimate the timing or cost of emission controls at this time.

On April 15, 2004, the EPA proposed amendments to its July 1999 Regional Haze Rule that requires
states to set periodic goals for improving visibility in 156 natural areas across the United States
by implementing state emission reduction rules. These amendments would apply to the eligible
industrial facilities emitting air pollutants that reduce visibility. States must develop
implementation rules by January 2008. Resulting rules could require additional reductions of NOx,
SO2 and particulate matter from coal-fired boilers including Northern Indiana’s electric generating
stations, depending upon the outcome of multi-pollutant regulations. On July 6, 2005, EPA
finalized Regional Haze Regulations and guidelines that allow states that opt to participate in the
CAIR cap-and-trade program to not require affected facilities to install, operate and maintain
additional control equipment. Until the state rules are promulgated, the potential impact on
Northern Indiana is uncertain. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor developments in
this area.

Water

. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative program is expected to add new water quality
standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern
Indiana’s three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has
promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA
approval. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its
operating lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying
with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. The water permit renewal for the
Michigan City Generating Station was released for public comment on December 22, 2005. Northern
Indiana anticipates the permit for the Michigan City Generating Station will be finalized in early
2006. In order to comply with the permit limits included in the draft version of this permit,
Northern Indiana anticipates the installation and operation of a wastewater treatment system at the
facility within four years of the final permit issuance date. Upon issuance of the permit,
engineering studies will be conducted to determine the costs and construction schedule of the
wastewater plant needed to comply with the final permit limits.

On February 16, 2004, the EPA Administrator signed the Phase II Rule of the Clean Water Act Section
316(b) which requires all large existing steam electric generating stations meet certain
performance standards to reduce the effects on aquatic organisms at their cooling water intake
structures. The rule became effective on September 7, 2004. Under this rule, stations will either
have to demonstrate that the performance of their existing fish protection systems meet the new
standards or develop new systems whose compliance is based on any of five options. To determine
the impacts of the Bailly Station’s intake on the aquatic organisms in Lake Michigan, a detailed
background biological sampling program was initiated in April 2005 and will continue for at least
one year. The results of this sampling program will be utilized to choose the appropriate
compliance option, or combination of options, for the facility. Specific impacts and available
compliance options of the final Phase II rule for the remaining two operating Northern Indiana
generating stations are still in the process of being determined at this time.

Remediation.

Northern Indiana is a potentially responsible party under the CERCLA and similar
State laws at two waste disposal sites and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other
potentially responsible parties. At one site, the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study
have been submitted for EPA review. At the second site, Northern Indiana has entered into EPA
Administrative Orders on Consent to perform an interim action, in conjunction with the landfill
owner/operator, which includes providing a municipal water supply system for approximately 275
homes. Northern Indiana has also agreed to conduct a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study
in the vicinity of the third party, state-permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for
fly ash disposal. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for
3 facilities that historically stored hazardous waste.

As of December 31, 2005, a reserve of approximately $3.1 million has been recorded to cover
probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites
cannot be estimated at this time but could be significant.

On March 31, 2005, the EPA and Northern Indiana entered into an Administrative Order on Consent
under the authority of Section 3008(h) of the RCRA for the Bailly Station. The order requires
Northern Indiana to identify the nature and extent of releases of hazardous waste and hazardous
constituents from the facility. Northern Indiana

must also remediate any release of hazardous
constituents that present an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. A reserve has
been established to fund the required investigations and conduct interim measures at the facility.
The final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean up
proceed and as additional information becomes available reserves are adjusted.

Other Operations.

PEI.

In connection with the sale of certain PEI assets mentioned above, NiSource has agreed to
provide indemnification to the purchaser for specified potential environmental liabilities.
However, the total amount of these liabilities is not reasonably estimable at this time.

Other Information.

Other Affiliates.

NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liabilities, including cleanup
liabilities associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations,
petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and CER. The most significant
environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liabilities are
associated with former petroleum operations and former mercury metering stations.

The ultimate liability in connection with these contamination sites will depend upon many factors
including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible
parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only
those corrective action costs currently known and
determinable can be considered “probable and reasonably estimable” under SFAS No. 5 and consistent
with SOP 96-1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as
appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former
operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on
NiSource’s financial position.

Environmental Reserves.

It is management’s continued intent to address environmental issues in
cooperation with regulatory authorities in such a manner as to achieve mutually acceptable
compliance plans. However, there can be no assurance that fines and penalties will not be
incurred. Management expects a significant portion of environmental assessment and remediation
costs to be recoverable through rates for certain NiSource companies.

As of December 31, 2005, a reserve of approximately $68.8 million has been recorded to cover
probable corrective actions at sites where NiSource has environmental remediation liability.
Regulatory assets have been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be
recovered in rates. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many
factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, the number of the other
potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, the extent of corrective actions
required and rate recovery. Based upon investigations and management’s understanding of current
environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any corrective actions required will not
have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.

G. Operating and Capital Lease Commitments.

NiSource leases assets in several areas of its
operations. Payments made in connection with operating leases were $54.7 million in 2005, $62.4
million in 2004 and $54.8 million in 2003, and are primarily charged to operation and maintenance
expense as incurred. Capital leases and related accumulated deprecation included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets were $3.8 million and $1.9 million at December 31, 2005, and $3.8
million and $1.6 million at December 31, 2004, respectively.

Future minimum rental payments required under operating and capital leases that have initial
or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year are:

H. Service Obligations.

NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline
capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates
ranging from 2006 to 2019, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges.

In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad
range of business process and support services to NiSource. As part of this agreement, IBM will
operate a broad range of business support functions for NiSource, including processes within the
human resources, finance and accounting, supply chain (procurement), customer contact,
meter-to-cash (billing and collections) and information technology areas. The agreement also
includes a broad array of transformational consulting services and emerging technology expertise.
The contract has a 10-year term and NiSource has the right to renew it for up to three additional
years. NiSource will pay for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The
variable charge component can fluctuate to reflect NiSource’s actual usage of service and service
levels. Fees may be adjusted to reflect economic changes such as inflation or business changes that
both parties agree to.

Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by
IBM), NiSource must pay IBM a termination charge that will include a breakage fee, repayment of
IBM’s un-recovered capital investments, and IBM wind-down expense. This termination fee can be a
material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the
termination.

Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products
and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under
this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a
combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various
performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana
terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty-year contract period.

The estimated aggregate amounts of minimum fixed payments at December 31, 2005, were:

Whiting Clean Energy.

PEI’s Whiting Clean Energy project at BP’s Whiting, Indiana refinery was
placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the
extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an
agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which
requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other
expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for
construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs.

For 2005, the PEI holding companies’ consolidated after-tax loss was approximately $22.6 million.
The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among
other things, approval of the electric sales agreement, prevailing prices in the energy markets and
regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the
steam requirements for BP’s oil refinery.

The effective income tax rates were 34.5%, 35.9%, and 35.5 % in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Contributing to the reduction in the effective tax rate for 2005 versus 2004 is the impact of the
tax benefit associated with the electric production deduction (discussed below), an adjustment to
deferred taxes at Northern Indiana related to a reduction in deferred income tax requirements and a
reduction in deferred state income tax liabilities resulting from a revised estimate of
consolidated state income tax apportionment factors. Offsetting these reductions is an increase in
the effective tax rate associated with the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge recorded at
Kokomo Gas and increased taxes related to Ohio income tax law changes enacted on June 30, 2005.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, signed into law on October 22, 2004, created new Internal
Revenue Code Section 199 which, beginning in 2005, permits taxpayers to claim a deduction from
taxable income attributable to certain domestic production activities. Northern Indiana and
Whiting Clean Energy’s electric production activities qualify for this deduction. The deduction is
equal to 3% of QPAI for the taxable year, with certain limitations. This deduction increases to 6%
of QPAI beginning in 2007 and 9% of QPAI beginning in 2010 and thereafter. The 2005 tax benefit
associated with the Section 199 domestic production deduction is estimated to be $1.9 million and
will be finalized prior to inclusion in NiSource’s 2005 consolidated federal income tax return to
be filed in 2006.

Segments of Business

Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is
available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to
allocate resources and in assessing performance.

NiSource’s operations are divided into four primary business segments. The Gas Distribution
Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and
industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana, Massachusetts,
Maine and New Hampshire. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas
transportation and storage services for local distribution companies, marketers and industrial and
commercial customers located in northeastern, mid-Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the
District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 21 counties in
the northern part of Indiana. The Other Operations segment primarily includes gas and power
marketing, and ventures focused on distributed power generation technologies, including
cogeneration facilities, fuel cells and storage systems.

The following tables provide information about business segments. NiSource uses operating income
as its primary measurement for each of the reported segments and makes decisions on finance,
dividends and taxes at the corporate level on a consolidated basis. Segment revenues include
intersegment sales to affiliated subsidiaries, which are eliminated in consolidation. Affiliated
sales are recognized on the basis of prevailing market, regulated prices or at levels provided for
under contractual agreements. Operating income is derived from revenues and expenses directly
associated with each segment.

ITEM 9.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

NiSource Inc.

None.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

NiSource’s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer, after evaluating the
effectiveness of NiSource’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)), have concluded based on the evaluation required by paragraph (b) of
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 that, as of the end of the period covered by this report,
NiSource’s disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective to ensure that material
information relating to NiSource and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by
others within those entities.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

NiSource management, including NiSource’s principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, are responsible for establishing and maintaining NiSource’s internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. However, management would note that a control system can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
NiSource’s management has adopted the framework set forth in the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission report, Internal Control — Integrated Framework, the most
commonly used and understood framework for evaluating internal control over financial reporting, as
its framework for evaluating the reliability and effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. During 2005, NiSource conducted an evaluation of its internal control over financial
reporting. Based on this evaluation, NiSource management concluded that NiSource’s internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual
report. Deloitte & Touche LLP, NiSource’s auditors, issued an attestation report on management’s
assessment of NiSource’s internal controls over financial reporting, which is contained within
their audit opinion in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Changes in Internal Controls

In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad
range of business process and support services to NiSource. On July 1, 2005, IBM assumed
responsibility for Information Technology, Human Resources and Supply Chain procurement functions
across NiSource as well as transition and transformation processes in the Meter to Cash and
Customer Contact Centers. Included in the Information Technology transformation process during
2005 and 2006 are major projects in Human Resources, Finance and Accounting, Supply Chain, Gas
Management, Operations and Meter to Cash. As of December 31, 2005, 546 employees have transitioned
employment to IBM while knowledge transfer of other assumed functions continues. Internal controls
related to these various activities have not been changed for the third or fourth quarter 2005,
however, in many cases new people are performing those controls or control activities are being
performed in a different location. In addition, controls have been added with respect to verifying
the accuracy of the invoice received from IBM under the outsourcing agreement.

The MISO Day 2 market became effective on April 1, 2005, which impacted Northern Indiana’s
regulated electric generation and purchase power operations. In connection with the implementation
of MISO Day 2, Northern Indiana has implemented new processes and modified existing processes to
facilitate participation in, and to verify amounts billed by the MISO. As part of it’s internal
control assessment, Northern Indiana relies on the SAS-70 report issued relative to the design and
effectiveness of the MISO internal controls.

Besides the internal control changes referenced above, there have been no other changes in
NiSource’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year covered by this report
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, NiSource’s internal
control over financial reporting.
