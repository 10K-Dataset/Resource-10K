PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

NiSource Inc.

NiSource is an energy holding company whose subsidiaries provide natural gas, electricity and other
products and services to approximately 3.8 million customers located within a corridor that runs
from the Gulf Coast through the Midwest to New England. NiSource is the successor to an Indiana
corporation organized in 1987 under the name of NIPSCO Industries, Inc., which changed its name to
NiSource Inc. on April 14, 1999. In connection with the acquisition of Columbia on November 1,
2000, NiSource became a Delaware corporation registered under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935. Effective February 8, 2006, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was
repealed. NiSource is now a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005.

NiSource is the largest natural gas distribution company operating east of the Rocky Mountains, as
measured by number of customers. NiSource’s principal subsidiaries include Columbia, a
vertically-integrated natural gas distribution, transmission and storage holding company whose
subsidiaries provide service to customers in the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast;
Northern Indiana, a vertically-integrated gas and electric company providing service to customers
in northern Indiana; and Bay State, a natural gas distribution company serving customers in New
England. NiSource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating
results of its 16 direct subsidiaries.

NiSource’s business segments are: Gas Distribution Operations; Gas Transmission and Storage
Operations; Electric Operations; and Other Operations. Following is a summary of the business for
each reporting segment. Refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations”, for additional information for each segment.

Gas Distribution Operations

NiSource’s natural gas distribution operations serve more than 3.3 million customers in nine states
and operate approximately 58 thousand miles of pipeline. Through its wholly owned subsidiary,
Columbia, NiSource owns five distribution subsidiaries that provide natural gas to approximately
2.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia,
Kentucky and Maryland. NiSource also distributes natural gas to approximately 795 thousand
customers in northern Indiana through three subsidiaries: Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and
Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Additionally, NiSource’s subsidiaries Bay State and Northern
Utilities distribute natural gas to approximately 342 thousand customers in Massachusetts, Maine
and New Hampshire.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations

NiSource’s Gas Transmission and Storage Operations subsidiaries own and operate approximately 16
thousand miles of interstate pipelines and operate one of the nation’s largest underground natural
gas storage systems capable of storing approximately 637 Bcf of natural gas. Through its
subsidiaries, Columbia Transmission, Columbia Gulf, Crossroads Pipeline and Granite State Gas,
NiSource owns and operates an interstate pipeline network extending from offshore in the Gulf of
Mexico to Lake Erie, New York and the eastern seaboard. Together, these companies serve customers
in 19 northeastern, mid-Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations subsidiaries are engaged in several projects that will
expand their facilities and throughput. The largest such project is the Millennium Pipeline, which
received FERC approval in December 2006. The reconfigured project will begin at an interconnect
with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly
towards Syracuse, New York. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with
Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium will extend eastward to an interconnect with
Algonquin at Ramapo, New York. Another project is Hardy Storage, a Columbia Transmission
partnership to develop a storage field in West Virginia to provide additional natural gas storage
for the eastern United States. Also, on January 14, 2008, the FERC awarded Columbia Transmission a
certificate for its Eastern Market Expansion project, which has precedent agreements with four East
Coast customers.


ITEM 1. BUSINESS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Electric Operations

NiSource generates, transmits and distributes electricity through its subsidiary Northern Indiana
to approximately 457 thousand customers in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana and engages
in wholesale and transmission transactions. Northern Indiana owns four and has the current ability
to operate three coal-fired electric generating stations. The three operable facilities have a net
capability of 2,574 mw. Northern Indiana also operates six gas-fired generating units with a net
capability of 323 mw and two hydroelectric generating plants with a net capability of 10 mw. These
facilities provide for a total system operating net capability of 2,907 mw. Northern Indiana’s
transmission system, with voltages from 69,000 to 345,000 volts, consists of 2,778 circuit miles.
Northern Indiana is interconnected with five neighboring electric utilities.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, Northern Indiana generated 78.5% and purchased 21.5% of
its electric requirements. Northern Indiana’s Mitchell Station, indefinitely shut down in 2002, is
not included in the net capacity of the three coal-fired generation stations. Northern Indiana
does not anticipate restarting the Mitchell Station in the near term. Northern Indiana’s IRP,
filed with the IURC in November 2007, indicated a gap between customer demand projections and
company owned generating capability of approximately 1,000 mw. Northern Indiana anticipates
regulatory approval to acquire CCGT generating facilities in 2008. On January 25, 2008, Northern
Indiana filed a CPCN to purchase the Sugar Creek CCGT facility. Northern Indiana is requesting the
IURC and the FERC to approve the purchase by the second quarter of 2008.

Northern Indiana participates in the MISO transmission service and wholesale energy market. The
MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of
electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Additionally, MISO is
responsible for managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, managing the
day-ahead, real-time and financial transmission rights markets and managing the ancillary market.
Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO and
transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff.

Other Operations

The Other Operations segment participates in energy-related services including gas marketing, power
and gas risk management and ventures focused on distributed power generation technologies,
including a cogeneration facility, fuel cells and storage systems. PEI operates the Whiting Clean
Energy project at BP’s Whiting, Indiana refinery, which is a 525 mw cogeneration facility that uses
natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and also provides steam for
industrial use. Additionally, the Other Operations segment is involved in real estate and other
businesses.

Divestiture of Non-Core Assets

In recent years, NiSource sold certain businesses judged to be non-core to NiSource’s strategy.
Lake Erie Land, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, has sold and is in the process of selling
certain real estate, which included its Sand Creek Golf Club assets, which were sold in June 2006,
to a private real estate developer. In addition, NDC Douglas Properties, a subsidiary of NiSource
Development Company, is in the process of exiting its low income housing investments.

Business Strategy

NiSource focuses its business strategy on its core, rate-regulated asset-based businesses with
virtually 100% of its operating income generated from the rate-regulated businesses. With the
nation’s fourth largest natural gas pipeline, the largest natural gas distribution network east of
the Rocky Mountains and one of the nation’s largest natural gas storage networks, NiSource operates
throughout the energy-intensive corridor that extends from the supply areas in the Gulf Coast
through the consumption centers in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, New England and Northeast. This
corridor includes over 40% of the nation’s population and close to 50% of its natural gas
consumption. NiSource continues to position its assets to meet the corridor’s growing energy
needs.

Competition and Changes in the Regulatory Environment

The regulatory frameworks applicable to NiSource’s operations, at both the state and federal
levels, continue to evolve. These changes have had and will continue to have an impact on
NiSource’s operations, structure and profitability. Management continually seeks new ways to be
more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including providing gas customers
with increased choices for products and services.


ITEM 1. BUSINESS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Natural Gas Competition.

Open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the
deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets. LDC
customers and marketers began to purchase gas directly from producers and marketers and an open,
competitive market for gas supplies has emerged. This separation or “unbundling” of the
transportation and other services offered by pipelines and LDCs allows customers to purchase the
commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and LDCs. The LDCs continue to
purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers. NiSource’s Gas Distribution
Operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to
purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use the NiSource Gas Distribution
Operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services.

Electric Competition.

In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the
formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate
pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. In compliance with the
rule, Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO
on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access
Transmission Tariff. On April 1, 2005, MISO implemented an electric energy market following
approved FERC tariffs. Northern Indiana currently sells all power from its plants into this
market.

NiSource’s Other Operations subsidiaries also experience competition for energy sales and related
services from third party providers. NiSource meets these challenges through innovative programs
aimed at providing energy products and services at competitive prices while also providing new
services that are responsive to the evolving energy market and customer requirements.

Financing Subsidiary

NiSource Finance is a wholly-owned, consolidated finance subsidiary of NiSource that engages in
financing activities to raise funds for the business operations of NiSource and its subsidiaries.
NiSource Finance was incorporated in February 2000 under the laws of the state of Indiana.
NiSource Finance’s obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NiSource.

Other Relevant Business Information

NiSource’s customer base is broadly diversified, with no single customer accounting for a
significant portion of revenues.

As of December 31, 2007, NiSource had 7,607 employees of whom 3,384 were subject to collective
bargaining agreements.

For a listing of certain subsidiaries of NiSource refer to Exhibit 21.

NiSource files various reports with the SEC. The reports include the annual report on Form 10-K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed
or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. NiSource
makes all SEC filings available without charge to the public on its web site at

http://www.nisource.com.


ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

NiSource Inc.

There are many factors that could have a material adverse effect on NiSource’s operating results,
financial condition and cash flows. New risks may emerge at any time, and NiSource cannot predict
those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance. Each of the
risks described below could adversely impact the value of NiSource’s securities.

NiSource has substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect its financial condition.

NiSource has a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding in part as a result of the
acquisition of Columbia and Bay State. NiSource had total consolidated indebtedness of $6,689.3
million outstanding as of December 31, 2007. The substantial indebtedness could have important
consequences to investors. For example, it could:

Some of NiSource’s debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debt-to-capital ratios
and cross-default provisions. NiSource’s failure to comply with any of these covenants could
result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of
outstanding debt obligations. Additionally, a drop in NiSource’s credit rating could adversely
impact the cost for NiSource to issue new debt securities.

On December 18, 2007, Standard and Poor’s lowered its senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its
subsidiaries to BBB-. Standard and Poor’s outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is
stable. On December 3, 2007, Moody’s Investors Services affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for
NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moody’s changed its ratings
outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries to negative from stable. On July 10, 2007, Fitch Ratings
affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB+ ratings for Northern Indiana.
Fitch’s outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue
to be investment grade, an additional downgrade by Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s would result in a
rating that is below investment grade.

Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased
collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB- by
Standard and Poor’s or Baa3 by Moody’s. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the
ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $40 million. In addition to agreements with
ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse
change” provisions that could result in additional credit support such as letters of credit and
cash collateral to transact business.

NiSource’s costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant. The costs of compliance
with future environmental laws and the incurrence of environmental liabilities could impact cash
flow and profitability.

NiSource’s subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental
requirements that, among other things, regulate air emissions, water usage and discharges,
remediation and the management of chemicals, hazardous waste and solid waste. Compliance with
these legal requirements requires NiSource to commit significant expenditures for installation of
pollution control equipment, remediation, environmental monitoring, emissions fees and permits at
many of NiSource’s facilities. These expenditures are significant, and NiSource expects that they
will continue to be significant in the future.

If NiSource’s subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to
the environment or persons, even if caused by factors beyond NiSource’s control, that failure or
harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against NiSource and
its subsidiaries. In September 2004, the EPA issued


ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

an NOV to Northern Indiana alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air
Act. An adverse outcome in this matter could require capital expenditures beyond the EPA
requirements that cannot be determined at this time and could require payment of substantial
penalties.

Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised, and new laws and regulations seeking to
protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to NiSource’s subsidiaries. Revised or
additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating
restrictions on NiSource’s facilities or increased compliance costs, which may not be fully
recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income. The cost impact of any new or
amended legislation would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at
this time.

A significant portion of the gas and electricity NiSource sells is used by residential and
commercial customers for heating and air conditioning. Accordingly, the operating results
fluctuate depending on the weather and, to a certain extent, usage of gas or electricity.

Energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather. Forecasts of energy sales are based on normal
weather, which represents a long-term historical average. Significant variations from normal
weather could have, and have had, a material impact on energy sales. Additionally, residential
usage, and to some degree commercial usage, have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity
costs for gas and electricity, whereby usage declines with increased costs, thus affecting
NiSource’s financial results.

NiSource’s electric operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries.

Electric operations in northern Indiana have been and may continue to be adversely affected by
events in the steel and steel related industries. In particular, sales to large industrial
customers within these steel and steel related industries may be impacted by economic downturns.
The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international
competition, increased costs, and fluctuating demand for their products.

The majority of NiSource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the
impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings.

Virtually all of NiSource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal
or state level. As such, the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to
regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority. These rate reviews determine the
energy rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues. As part of a settlement reached in
other regulatory proceedings, Northern Indiana has agreed to file an electric base rate case with
the IURC on or before July 1, 2008. Columbia of Ohio filed a base rate case on March 3, 2008.
Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case on January 28, 2008. Both companies expect final
resolution of the cases to occur in 2008. The outcome for any rate case could have a material
effect on NiSource’s financial results.

NiSource recently restructured its outsourcing agreement with IBM, which included transitioning
many of the functions which had been outsourced. Many associated changes in systems and personnel
are being made, which may increase operational and control risks during transition and may have an
impact on the business and its financial condition.

Under NiSource’s restructured agreement with IBM, most functions, other than information
technology, which had been outsourced to IBM will be transitioned back to NiSource or other third
party providers. There will be costs incurred to undertake this transition and there could be a
risk of operational delays, potential errors and control failures during the transition phase.


ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

NiSource’s Whiting Clean Energy project has generated losses and may be sold at a substantial
discount to the value of the facility on NiSource’s balance sheet.

NiSource owns and operates a merchant energy facility, Whiting Clean Energy, at BP’s Whiting,
Indiana refinery. This facility uses natural gas to generate electricity for sale in the wholesale
markets and to generate steam for industrial use by BP’s refinery. The profitability of this
facility is dependant upon the market prices for electricity and natural gas and regional load
dispatch patterns. On July 27, 2007, Whiting Clean Energy submitted a proposal in response to the
Northern Indiana-issued RFP “2008 Combined Cycle Request for Proposals.” Whiting Clean Energy was
notified during October 2007 that its proposal to sell its facility was selected by Northern
Indiana based on a purchase price of $210 million. However, on December 22, 2007, BP indicated it
would exercise a contractual right of first refusal to purchase the Whiting Clean Energy facility.
NiSource is in discussions with BP regarding several aspects of the offer. The carrying amount of
the Whiting Clean Energy facility is approximately $270 million.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.


ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

NiSource Inc.

Discussed below are the principal properties held by NiSource and its subsidiaries as of December
31, 2007.

Gas Distribution Operations.

NiSource’s Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries own and operate a
total of 58,362 miles of pipelines and certain related facilities. This includes: (i) for the
five distribution subsidiaries of its Columbia system, 35,266 miles of pipelines, 1,350 reservoir
acres of underground storage, eight storage wells, liquid propane facilities with a capacity of 1.8
million gallons, an LNG facility with a total capacity of 0.5 million gallons and one compressor
station with 800 hp of installed capacity, (ii) for its Northern Indiana system, 15,274 miles of
pipelines, 27,129 reservoir acres of underground storage, 82 storage wells, two compressor stations
with a total of 6,000 hp of installed capacity and an LNG facility with a storage capacity of 48.6
million gallons, (iii) for its Bay State system, 5,843 miles of pipelines, LNG facilities with a
total capacity of 22.0 million gallons and liquid propane facilities with a capacity of 1.7 million
gallons (iv) for its Northern Indiana Fuel and Light system, 943 miles of pipelines, and (v) for
its Kokomo Gas system, 1,036 miles of pipelines and an LNG facility with a capacity of 4.9 million
gallons. The physical properties of the NiSource gas utilities are located throughout Ohio,
Indiana, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations.

Columbia Transmission has approximately 867,000
reservoir acres of underground storage, 3,524 storage wells, 12,105 miles of interstate pipelines
and 86 compressor stations with 580,548 hp of installed capacity. These operations are located in
Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia
and West Virginia. Not including the offshore assets held for sale to Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Company, Columbia Gulf has 3,430 miles of transmission pipelines and 11 compressor stations with
445,444 hp of installed capacity. Columbia Gulf’s operations are located in Kentucky, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas, Wyoming, and the offshore Gulf of Mexico. Granite State Gas has 86
miles of transmission pipeline with operations located in Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
Crossroads Pipeline has 211 miles of transmission pipeline and one compressor station with 3,000 hp
of installed capacity. Crossroads Pipeline’s operations are located in Indiana and Ohio.

Electric Operations.

Northern Indiana owns four and has the current ability to operate three
coal-fired electric generating stations. The three operable facilities have a net capability of
2,574 mw. Northern Indiana also operates six gas-fired generating units with a net capability of
323 mw and two hydroelectric generating plants with a net capability of 10 mw. These facilities
provide for a total system operating net capability of 2,907 mw. Northern Indiana’s transmission
system, with voltages from 69,000 to 345,000 volts, consists of 2,778 circuit miles. Northern
Indiana is interconnected with five neighboring electric utilities.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, Northern Indiana generated 78.5% and purchased 21.5% of
its electric requirements. Northern Indiana’s Mitchell Station, indefinitely shut down in 2002, is
not included in the net capacity of the three coal-fired generation stations. Northern Indiana
does not anticipate restarting the Mitchell Station in the near term. Northern Indiana’s IRP,
filed with the IURC in November 2007, indicated a gap between customer demand projections and
company owned generating capability of approximately 1,000 mw. Northern Indiana anticipates
regulatory approval to acquire CCGT generating facilities in 2008. On January 25, 2008, Northern
Indiana filed a CPCN to purchase the Sugar Creek CCGT facility. Northern Indiana is requesting the
IURC and the FERC to approve the purchase by the second quarter of 2008.

Other Operations.

PEI owns and operates the Whiting Clean Energy project at BP’s Whiting, Indiana
refinery, which is a 525 mw cogeneration facility that uses natural gas to produce electricity for
sale in the wholesale markets and also provides steam for industrial use. As noted above, Whiting
Clean Energy is in discussions with BP regarding BP’s offer to purchase the Whiting Clean Energy
facility. Through other subsidiaries, NiSource owns the Southlake Complex, its 325,000 square foot
headquarters building located in Merrillville, Indiana and other residential and development
property.


ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Character of Ownership.

The principal offices and properties of NiSource and its subsidiaries are
held in fee and are free from encumbrances, subject to minor exceptions, none of which are of such
a nature as to impair substantially the usefulness of such properties. Many of the offices in
various communities served are occupied by subsidiaries of NiSource under leases. All properties
are subject to liens for taxes, assessments and undetermined charges (if any) incidental to
construction. It is NiSource’s practice regularly to pay such amounts, as and when due, unless
contested in good faith. In general, the electric lines, gas pipelines and related facilities are
located on land not owned in fee but are covered by necessary consents of various governmental
authorities or by appropriate rights obtained from owners of private property. NiSource does not,
however, generally have specific easements from the owners of the property adjacent to public
highways over, upon or under which its electric lines and gas distribution pipelines are located.
At the time each of the principal properties was purchased a title search was made. In general, no
examination of titles as to rights-of-way for electric lines, gas pipelines or related facilities
was made, other than examination, in certain cases, to verify the grantors’ ownership and the lien
status thereof.


ITEM
3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

NiSource Inc.

1. Stand Energy Corporation, et al. v. Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation, et al.,
Kanawha County Court, West Virginia

On July 14, 2004, Stand Energy Corporation filed a complaint in Kanawha County Court in West
Virginia. The complaint contains allegations against various NiSource companies, including
Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, and asserts that those companies and certain “select
shippers” engaged in an “illegal gas scheme” that constituted a breach of contract and violated
state law. The “illegal gas scheme” complained of by the plaintiffs relates to the Columbia
Transmission and Columbia Gulf gas imbalance transactions that were the subject of the FERC
enforcement staff investigation and subsequent settlement approved in October 2000. Columbia
Transmission and Columbia Gulf filed a Motion to Dismiss on September 10, 2004. In October
2004, however, the plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint, which clarified the identity
of some of the “select shipper” defendants and added a federal antitrust cause of action. To
address the issues raised in the Second Amended Complaint, the Columbia companies revised their
briefs in support of the previously filed motions to dismiss. In June 2005, the Court granted
in part and denied in part the Columbia companies’ motion to dismiss the Second Amended
Complaint. The Columbia companies have filed an answer to the Second Amended Complaint. On
December 1, 2005, Plaintiffs filed a motion to certify this case as a class action. The Court
has ordered that discovery will proceed on the issue of class certification as well as the
merits.

2. United States of America ex rel. Jack J. Grynberg v. Columbia Gas Transmission
Corporation, et al., U.S. District Court, E.D. Louisiana

The plaintiff filed a complaint in 1997, under the False Claims Act, on behalf of the United
States of America, against approximately seventy pipelines, including Columbia Gulf and Columbia
Transmission. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants had submitted false royalty reports to
the government (or caused others to do so) by mismeasuring the volume and heating content of
natural gas produced on Federal land and Indian lands. The Plaintiff’s original complaint was
dismissed without prejudice for misjoinder of parties and for failing to plead fraud with
specificity. The plaintiff then filed over sixty-five new False Claims Act complaints against
over 330 defendants in numerous Federal courts. One of those complaints was filed in the
Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against Columbia and thirteen
affiliated entities (collectively, the “Columbia defendants”).

Plaintiff’s second complaint, filed in 1997, repeated the mismeasurement claims previously made
and added valuation claims alleging that the defendants undervalued natural gas for royalty
purposes in various ways, including sales to affiliated entities at artificially low prices.
Most of the Grynberg cases were transferred to Federal court in Wyoming in 1999.

On October 20, 2006, the Federal District Court issued an Order granting the Columbia
defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Plaintiff has
appealed the dismissal of the Columbia defendants.

3. Tawney, et al. v. Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., Roane County, WV Circuit Court

The Plaintiffs, who are West Virginia landowners, filed a lawsuit in early 2003 against CNR
alleging that CNR underpaid royalties on gas produced on their land by improperly deducting
post-production costs and not paying a fair value for the gas. In December 2004, the court
granted plaintiffs’ motion to add NiSource and Columbia as defendants. Plaintiffs also claimed
that the defendants fraudulently concealed the deduction of post-production charges. The court
certified the case as a class action that includes any person who, after July 31, 1990, received
or is due royalties from CNR (and its predecessors or successors) on lands lying within the
boundary of the state of West Virginia. All claims by the government of the United States are
excluded from the class. Although NiSource sold CNR in 2003, NiSource remains obligated to
manage this litigation and for the majority of any damages ultimately awarded to the plaintiffs.
On January 27, 2007, the jury hearing the case returned a verdict against all defendants in the
amount of $404.3 million; this is comprised of $134.3 million in compensatory damages and $270
million in punitive damages. In January 2008, defendants filed their petition for appeal, and
will be filing an amended petition in March, with the West Virginia Supreme Court

of Appeals, which may or may not accept the appeal. NiSource has not established a reserve for
the punitive damages portion of the verdict.

4. John Thacker, et al. v. Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C., U.S. District Court, E.D.
Kentucky

On February 8, 2007, Plaintiff filed this purported class action, alleging that Chesapeake
Appalachia, L.L.C. (“Chesapeake”) has failed to pay royalty owners the correct amounts pursuant
to the provisions of their oil and gas leases covering real property located within the state of
Kentucky. Columbia has assumed the defense of Chesapeake in this matter pursuant to the
provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreement dated July 3, 2003, among Columbia, NiSource, and
Triana Energy Holding, Inc., Chesapeake’s predecessor in interest. Plaintiffs filed an amended
complaint on March 19, 2007, which, among other things, added NiSource and Columbia as
defendants. All of the Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss have been fully briefed and await a
ruling by the court.

5. Environmental Protection Agency Notice of Violation

On September 29, 2004, the EPA issued an NOV to Northern Indiana for alleged violations of the
Clean Air Act and the Indiana SIP. The NOV alleges that modifications were made to certain
boiler units at three of Northern Indiana’s generating stations between the years of 1985 and
1995 without obtaining appropriate air permits for the modifications. Northern Indiana is
currently in discussions with the EPA regarding possible resolutions to this NOV.

6. Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Proposed Consent Order and
Agreement

On February 21, 2007, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection provided
representatives of Columbia Transmission with a proposed Consent Order and Agreement covering an
unmanned equipment storage site located in rural southwest Pennsylvania. The site in question
is also subject to the EPA’s Administrative Order by Consent (Refer to Note 18-E, “Environmental
Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding
the Administrative Order by Consent). Pursuant to that order, Columbia Transmission has
submitted a remediation plan to the EPA and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection. The EPA has approved the remediation plan and discussions are ongoing with the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection regarding the proposed remediation. It is
currently anticipated that remediation will begin in spring 2008. Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection’s proposed order alleges that Columbia Transmission has violated the
state’s Clean Streams Act and Solid Waste Management Act by discharging petroleum products onto
the property and into the waters of the state. In addition to requiring remediation and
monitoring activities at the site, the state has proposed penalties for these violations.
Columbia Transmission plans to engage in further discussions with the agency regarding the
proposed order, including the rationale for the proposed penalty.

As of December 31, 2007, NiSource had 38,091 common stockholders of record and 274,176,752 shares
outstanding.

Holders of shares of NiSource’s common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, and if
declared by NiSource’s Board out of funds legally available. The policy of the Board has been to
declare cash dividends on a quarterly basis payable on or about the 20th day of February, May,
August and November. NiSource paid quarterly common dividends totaling $0.92 per share for the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. By unanimous written consent dated January 4, 2008,
the Board declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.23 per share, payable on February 20, 2008 to
holders of record on January 31, 2008.

Although the Board currently intends to continue the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on
common shares, the timing and amount of future dividends will depend on the earnings of NiSource’s
subsidiaries, their financial condition, cash requirements, regulatory restrictions, any
restrictions in financing agreements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, Whiting Clean Energy redeemed its outstanding long-term notes. The associated redemption premium of $40.6 million was recorded as a loss on early extinguishment of
long-term debt.

Note regarding forward-looking statements

The Management’s Discussion and Analysis, including statements regarding market risk sensitive
instruments, contains “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Investors and prospective investors should understand that many factors govern whether
any forward-looking statement contained herein will be or can be realized. Any one of those
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning NiSource’s plans,
objectives, expected performance, expenditures and recovery of expenditures through rates, stated
on either a consolidated or segment basis, and any and all underlying assumptions and other
statements that are other than statements of historical fact. From time to time, NiSource may
publish or otherwise make available forward-looking statements of this nature. All such subsequent
forward-looking statements, whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of NiSource,
are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. All forward-looking statements are
based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance
that actual results will not differ materially.

Realization of NiSource’s objectives and expected performance is subject to a wide range of risks
and can be adversely affected by, among other things, weather, fluctuations in supply and demand
for energy commodities, growth opportunities for NiSource’s businesses, increased competition in
deregulated energy markets, the success of regulatory and commercial initiatives, dealings with
third parties over whom NiSource has no control, the success of NiSource’s restructured outsourcing
agreement, actual operating experience of NiSource’s assets, the regulatory process, regulatory and
legislative changes, changes in general economic, capital and commodity market conditions, and
counter-party credit risk, many of which risks are beyond the control of NiSource. In addition,
the relative contributions to profitability by each segment, and the assumptions underlying the
forward-looking statements relating thereto, may change over time.

CONSOLIDATED REVIEW

Executive Summary

NiSource is an energy holding company whose subsidiaries are engaged in the transmission, storage
and distribution of natural gas in the high-demand energy corridor stretching from the Gulf Coast
through the Midwest to New England and the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity
in Indiana. NiSource generates virtually 100% of its operating income through these rate-regulated
businesses. A significant portion of NiSource’s operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations in
sales. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, net revenues
from gas are more significant, and during the cooling season, which is primarily from June through
September, net revenues from electric sales and transportation services are more significant than
in other months.

NiSource is a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005.


ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, NiSource reported income from continuing operations
before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $312.0 million, or $1.14 per basic
share, compared to $313.5 million, or $1.15 per basic share in 2006.

Increases in net revenues and equity earnings were offset by higher operating expenses and other
deductions. The increase in net revenues of $139.1 million was impacted by the following key
factors:

Additionally, equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates increased $21.7 million due to Hardy
Storage being placed in service in April 2007, higher AFUDC earnings from Millennium and the impact
of Millennium recording a $13 million reserve in 2006 related to vacated portions of the original
project.

The revenue and equity earnings increases were offset by increases in operating expenses, interest
expense and a loss on early extinguishment of debt. Following are the primary drivers for those
increases.

These factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the
following discussions of “Results of Operations” and “Results and Discussion of Segment
Operations.”


ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Four-Point Platform for Growth

NiSource has established four key initiatives to build a platform for long-term, sustainable
growth: commercial and regulatory initiatives; commercial growth and expansion of the gas
transmission and storage business; financial management of the balance sheet; and process and
expense management.

Commercial and Regulatory Initiatives

Whiting Clean Energy.

On December 18, 2006, Whiting Clean Energy and BP executed an amendment
which materially changed the terms of the ESA under which Whiting Clean Energy provides steam to
BP. The agreement specifies a planned termination of the ESA at the end of 2009, with options for
BP to extend the term one additional year under renegotiated steam pricing. Whiting Clean Energy
accrued $17.0 million in December 2006, for costs associated with contract termination terms under
the agreement. Additionally, BP would have the right of first refusal regarding any offers for the
sale of the Whiting Clean Energy facility at BP.

On July 27, 2007, Whiting Clean Energy submitted a proposal in response to the Northern
Indiana-issued RFP “2008 Combined Cycle Request for Proposals”. Whiting Clean Energy was notified
during October 2007 that its proposal to sell its facility was selected by Northern Indiana based
on a purchase price of $210 million. On December 22, 2007, BP indicated it would exercise a
contractual right of first refusal to purchase the Whiting Clean Energy facility. Whiting Clean
Energy is in discussions with BP regarding several aspects of the offer. The carrying amount of
the Whiting Clean Energy facility is approximately $270 million.

On December 31, 2007, Whiting Clean Energy redeemed $292.1 million of its notes due June 20, 2011,
having an average interest rate of 8.30%. The associated redemption premium of $40.6 million was
charged to loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt. The redemption was financed with
NiSource borrowings.

Rate Development and Other Regulatory Matters.

NiSource is moving forward on regulatory
initiatives across several distribution company markets. Whether through full rate case filings or
other approaches, NiSource’s goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as it
addresses changing customer conservation patterns, develops more contemporary pricing structures,
and embarks on long-term investment programs to enhance its infrastructure. Rate case planning
activities are underway at Northern Indiana with a filing anticipated during 2008.

Columbia of Pennsylvania, on January 28, 2008, filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania Public
Utilities Commission seeking to increase the company’s base rates by approximately $60 million
annually, effective October 28, 2008. The rate case filing follows Columbia of Pennsylvania’s 2007
launch of a 20-year, $1.4 billion natural gas infrastructure enhancement program that is designed
to replace in excess of 100 miles of underground natural gas distribution lines and related
facilities annually. Columbia of Pennsylvania is also actively supporting legislation in
Pennsylvania that would provide for a regulatory mechanism to recover the costs associated with
natural gas infrastructure improvement programs on a timely basis.

On February 1, 2008, Columbia of Ohio filed its Notice of Intent to File An Application For
Increase in Rates. The Columbia of Ohio Application was filed on March 3, 2008, requesting an
increase in base rates in excess of $80 million.

On December 21, 2007, Columbia of Virginia received approval from the Virginia State Corporation
Commission to implement an off-system sales and capacity release incentive mechanism, effective
January 1, 2008. The incentive mechanism provides Columbia of Virginia the opportunity to reduce
overall gas costs for its customers and to generate incremental revenue by allowing the company to
retain up to 25% of off-system sales and capacity release revenues, with the remainder to be
returned to customers.

At Bay State, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities approved a $5.9 million annual
increase in the company’s base rates, effective November 1, 2007, under the company’s
performance-based rate mechanism. On October 17, 2007, Bay State petitioned the Massachusetts
Department of Public Utilities to allow the company to collect an additional $7.5 million in annual
revenue related to usage reductions occurring since its last rate case. Bay State also requested
approval of a steel infrastructure tracker that would allow for recovery of ongoing

NiSource Inc.

infrastructure replacement program investments. The Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities
is scheduled to hold hearings on this matter in the first quarter of 2008.

Columbia of Kentucky received approval during 2007 of a base rate case settlement with regulatory
stakeholders that increases total annual revenues by $7.25 million, or 4.5 percent.

During 2007, Northern Indiana achieved a number of important regulatory and operational
accomplishments. In May 2007, the company received IURC approval for its Rate Simplification
program, which provides benefits for both Northern Indiana and its customers, including the
creation of a new energy conservation program.

On January 30, 2008, the IURC approved a settlement agreement which was reached in October 2007
with the OUCC, LaPorte County and a group of Northern Indiana industrial customers to resolve
questions relating to the costs paid by customers for power purchased by Northern Indiana versus
the amount of these costs absorbed by Northern Indiana. The terms of the settlement call for
Northern Indiana to make a one-time payment to resolve this question as it relates to power
purchased from January 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007. The amount of the refund is set at
$33.5 million. A reserve for the entire amount was recorded in the third quarter of 2007.
Northern Indiana implemented a new “benchmarking standard” that will govern the allocation of costs
for purchased power between customers and Northern Indiana. The benchmark defines the price below
which customers will pay for power purchases and above which Northern Indiana must absorb a portion
of the costs. The benchmark is based upon the costs of power generated by a hypothetical natural
gas fired CCGT’s using gas purchased and delivered to Northern Indiana. This will most likely
result in Northern Indiana absorbing some purchased power costs that will reduce net revenues
during future periods. The agreement also contemplates Northern Indiana adding generating capacity
to its existing portfolio. The benchmark will be adjusted as new capacity is added. The added
generating capacity will substantially reduce the amount of purchased power and mitigate the impact
of the adjusted benchmark. Further, the settling parties agreed to support Northern Indiana’s
deferral and future recovery of carrying costs and depreciation associated with the acquisition of
new generating facilities. In the approving order, the IURC dictated that, while the parties
agreed to support the deferral of costs mentioned above, the IURC would rule on such deferral in
CPCN proceedings.

On November 1, 2007, Northern Indiana filed its bi-annual IRP with the IURC. The plan showed the
need to add approximately 1,000 mw of new capacity. Additionally, during November 2007, Northern
Indiana filed a CPCN as well as contracts to purchase power generated with renewable energy,
specifically with wind. The CPCN requested approval to purchase two CCGT power plants — the
Whiting Clean Energy facility owned by PEI, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, and the Sugar
Creek facility located in west central Indiana and owned by LS Power Group. On December 22, 2007,
BP indicated it would exercise a contractual right of first refusal to purchase the Whiting Clean
Energy facility. Whiting Clean Energy is in discussions with BP regarding several aspects of the
offer. As a result, on January 25, 2008, Northern Indiana filed an amended CPCN to address just
the Sugar Creek CCGT facility. The estimated cost of the facility is $329 million. Northern
Indiana is requesting the IURC and the FERC to approve the purchase by the second quarter of 2008.

Columbia of Ohio and other stakeholders reached an agreement in the fourth quarter of 2007 that
establishes the framework for operations under Columbia of Ohio’s CHOICE

®

program for
the next several years and provides for a wholesale gas supply auction by early 2010. On January
23, 2008, the PUCO approved the agreement. During 2007, Columbia of Ohio also filed with the PUCO
a Joint Stipulation that clarifies the company’s operational responsibilities for customer-owned
service lines and faulty risers. The stipulation establishes a recovery mechanism to collect
certain costs associated with repair or replacement of customer-owned service lines and replacement
of risers and resolves outstanding issues related to this important customer safety program.

Refer to the “Results and Discussion of Segment Operations” for a complete discussion of regulatory
matters.

Pending Sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas.

On February 15, 2008, NiSource reached a
definitive agreement under which Unitil Corporation will acquire NiSource subsidiaries Northern
Utilities and Granite State Gas for $160 million plus net working capital at the time of closing.
Historically, net working capital has averaged approximately $25 million. Under the terms of the
transaction, Unitil Corporation will acquire Northern Utilities, a local gas distribution company
serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire and Granite State Gas,
an 86-mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New

OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Hampshire. The transaction, expected to be complete by the end of 2008, is subject to federal and
state regulatory approvals. During the quarter ended March 31, 2008, NiSource expects to recognize
an after tax loss of approximately $65 million related to the pending sale and to account for
Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas as discontinued operations.

NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the company’s larger
acquisition of Bay State. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Bay State as a core component of
the company’s long-term, investment-driven growth strategy.

Commercial Growth and Expansion of the Gas Transmission and Storage Business

Master Limited Partnership.

On December 21, 2007, NiSource Energy Partners, L.P., an MLP and
subsidiary of NiSource, filed an S-1 registration statement with the SEC in which it proposed
making an initial public offering of common units in the MLP and NiSource proposed contributing its
interest in Columbia Gulf to the MLP. NiSource management believes the formation of an MLP is a
natural complement to NiSource’s gas transmission and storage growth strategy, and should provide
NiSource access to competitively priced capital to support future growth investment.

Millennium Pipeline Project

.

In June 2007, construction began on the Millennium Pipeline, a
182-mile-long, 30-inch-diameter pipeline across New York’s Southern Tier and lower Hudson Valley.
The project is expected to be completed in November 2008 and will transport up to 525,400 Dth per
day of natural gas to markets along its route, as well as to the New York City markets through its
pipeline interconnections. Millennium is jointly owned by affiliates of NiSource, KeySpan
Corporation, and DTE Energy.

Hardy Storage Project.

Hardy Storage completed its third full quarter of operations, receiving
customer injections into its new underground natural gas storage facility in West Virginia.
Injections this year will allow the field to deliver up to 150,000 Dth of natural gas per day
during the 2008-2009 winter heating season. Customers withdrew over 900,000 Dth from the storage
field during the last two months of 2007. When fully operational in 2009, the field will have a
working storage capacity of 12 billion cubic feet, delivering more than 176,000 Dth of natural gas
per day. Hardy Storage is a joint venture of subsidiaries of Columbia Transmission and Piedmont.

Columbia Transmission, the operator of Hardy Storage, is expanding its natural gas transmission
system by 176,000 Dth per day to provide the capacity needed to deliver Hardy Storage supplies to
customer markets. Construction of these transmission facilities is substantially complete and
partially in service. The remainder will be placed in-service in the first half of 2008.

Eastern Market Expansion Project

.

On May 3, 2007, Columbia Transmission filed a certificate
application before the FERC for approval to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and
transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities. This Eastern Market Expansion
project is projected to add 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation capacity and is fully
subscribed on a 15-year contracted firm basis. On January 14, 2008, the FERC issued a favorable
order which granted a certificate to construct the project and the project is expected to be in
service by spring 2009.

Ohio Storage Project

.

Columbia Transmission concluded successful open seasons to gauge customer
interest in an expansion of its storage in Ohio. The final scope of the project will be determined
based on the outcome of the ongoing customer discussions. This project was previously referred to
as the Crawford Storage Field project.

Other Growth Projects.

Columbia Gulf recently expanded interconnection points to provide
incremental delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day to Henry Hub and 85,000 Dth per day to Southern
Natural Gas near Lafayette, Louisiana. Columbia Gulf entered into firm contracts for this
capacity and the facilities were placed into service during the third quarter of 2007. A
successful open season was held in the first quarter of 2007 to sell capacity of 380,000 Dth per
day to two interconnection points with Transcontinental Gas Pipeline. This capacity provides
increased access to downstream pipelines and their customers that access mid-Atlantic and Northeast
markets. These interconnection points were placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2007.


ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

An open season to solicit interest and contracts for expanded capacity on Columbia Gulf’s system
for delivery to Florida Gas Transmission was held in October and November 2007. This project is
currently in development based on customer interest expressed during the open season.

Financial Management of the Balance Sheet

Refinancing of Debt.

On August 31, 2007, NiSource Finance issued $800 million of 6.40%, 10.5-year
senior unsecured notes that mature March 15, 2018. The proceeds were used to repay short-term bank
borrowings, to fund the redemption of $24 million of Northern Indiana variable rate pollution
control bonds due November 2007 and for capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. The
short-term bank borrowings were previously used to fund the redemption of Northern Indiana’s
preferred stock in 2006, having a total redemption value of $81.6 million, and for the repayment of
an aggregate $503.5 million of long-term debt in 2006 and the first nine months of 2007.

Shelf Registration.

On December 21, 2007, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the
SEC for an unspecified principal amount of debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other
securities. NiSource is classified as a well-known seasoned issuer and the registration statement
will be effective for three years.

Credit Ratings.

On December 18, 2007, Standard and Poor’s lowered its senior unsecured ratings
for NiSource and its subsidiaries to BBB-. Standard and Poor’s outlook for NiSource and all of its
subsidiaries is stable. On December 3, 2007, Moody’s Investors Services affirmed the senior
unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries.
Moody’s changed its ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries to negative from stable. On
July 10, 2007, Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB+
ratings for Northern Indiana. Fitch’s outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable.
Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, an additional downgrade by Standard and
Poor’s or Moody’s would result in a rating that is below investment grade.

Process and Expense Management

IBM Agreement.

During the second quarter of 2005, NiSource Corporate Services reached a definitive
agreement with IBM under which IBM was to provide a broad range of business transformation and
outsourcing services to NiSource and was anticipated to provide a cost savings over the 10-year
agreement. As a part of the transformation initiatives, many new information technology systems
and process changes had an accelerated time-line for completion, which increased costs in 2006 and
2007 and created the risk of operational delays, potential errors and control failures which could
impact NiSource and its financial condition. In August 2006, further implementation of certain
information technology systems was delayed due to difficulties encountered with the first wave of
new system implementations.

In early 2007, a high-level team of NiSource and IBM resources began an overall reassessment of the
outsourcing initiative primarily to focus on operational and transformational improvements and
remediation and to develop an integrated plan that enables NiSource to achieve its business
objectives going forward. In the first quarter of 2007, NiSource decided to bring certain finance
and accounting functions back within the company. These functions included general accounting,
fixed asset accounting, and budgeting. In December 2007, NiSource and IBM finalized a
restructuring of their business services agreement. Under the restructured agreement, IBM will
primarily provide information technology services, with a number of other business service
functions to be transitioned back to the NiSource organization. Going forward, NiSource will be in
a position to more effectively manage its employee and administrative expenses, while ensuring
delivery of services needed to meet the company’s needs.

2008 — 2010 Outlook

Earnings from continuing operations for the 2008-2010 periods are expected to fall within a range
of $1.23 to $1.35 per share. These expected results assume normal weather and no impact from
business dispositions, impairments, costs to retire debt and other significant items similar to
those that impacted 2007 results. These items are discussed within the “Results of Operation” of
this Item 7. Some of the actions taken during 2007 to establish a foundation for future growth
will place pressure on NiSource’s earnings in 2008. For example, the planned acquisition of a new
generating facility and the purchase power settlement will impact earnings prior to the
effectiveness of the electric rate case in the Northern Indiana business, but have been factored in
to these projected earnings.


ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

From a financing and credit rating standpoint, NiSource expects to issue additional long term debt
in excess of $500 million during 2008 and is committed to maintaining an investment grade rating.

NiSource’s four-part business plan will continue to center on expansion of and commercial growth in
the natural gas pipeline and storage business, regulatory and commercial initiatives at its
utilities, financial management, and process and expense management. Within that plan, NiSource
will place particular emphasis on three important areas during 2008.

•

Achieving key regulatory initiatives, including gas base rate cases in Pennsylvania and
Ohio, as well as Northern Indiana’s electric rate case scheduled for filing on July 1, 2008.

•

Advancing Gas Transmission and Storage Operation growth strategy, including securing
approvals and timely construction of announced projects, developing an array of potential new
growth opportunities, and continuing with the formation of the MLP.

•

Executing on major infrastructure enhancement projects, which will constitute a significant
portion of NiSource’s more than $1 billion annual capital investment program expected for the
2008 to 2012 period.

Ethics and Controls

NiSource has always been committed to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well
as requiring a strong commitment to ethical behavior by its employees. NiSource’s senior
management takes an active role in the development of this Form 10-K and the monitoring of the
company’s internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue the
mandatory ethics-training program in which employees at every level and in every function of the
organization participate.

Management’s evaluation of internal controls for 2007 identified a material weakness in
Northern Indiana’s unbilled revenue estimating process. Over a period of several years, Northern
Indiana used incorrect customer usage data to calculate Northern Indiana’s unbilled revenue
estimate. As of year-end 2007, these incremental errors caused a cumulative overstatement of
Northern Indiana’s net revenue. The unbilled revenue estimates were never billed to customers and
the error was corrected in the fourth quarter of 2007. Refer to “Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” included in Item 9A.

Results of Operations

The Consolidated Review information should be read taking into account the critical accounting
policies applied by NiSource and discussed in “Other Information” of this Item 7.

Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, NiSource reported income from continuing operations
before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $312.0 million, or $1.14 per basic
share, compared to $313.5 million, or $1.15 per basic share in 2006. Income from continuing
operations before the cumulative change in accounting principle for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2005 was $284.1 million, or $1.05 per basic share.

Including results from discontinued operations and the change in accounting principle, NiSource
reported 2007 net income of $321.4 million, or $1.17 per basic share, 2006 net income of $282.2
million, or $1.04 per basic share, and 2005 net income of $306.5 million, or $1.13 per basic share.

Comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory trackers that allow for the
recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. Therefore, increases in these
tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on
income from continuing operations. An increase in operating expenses of $21.0 million for the 2007
year was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of these tracked
costs. In the 2006 period, an increase in operating expenses of $55.3 million for trackers was
offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs. These
increases in 2006 and in 2007 were largely attributable to higher uncollectible accounts.


ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Net Revenues

Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2007 were $3,263.7 million, a $139.1 million increase compared with 2006, which
includes the impact of $21.0 million of trackers discussed above. NiSource’s operating segments
contributed to this overall increase in net revenues as follows: Gas Distribution Operations net
revenues increased $100.1 million; Other Operations increased $29.6 million; Gas Transmission and
Storage Operations contributed $20.0 million; and, Electric Operations decreased $10.8 million.
Net revenue increases from Gas Distribution Operations were primarily a result of favorable weather
of approximately $73 million, a $15.8 million increase in revenues from regulatory trackers, which
are primarily offset in operating expense and higher net revenues from regulatory initiatives and
other service programs of $10.9 million, partially offset by a $14.6 million adjustment for
estimated unbilled revenues. Increased net revenues from the Whiting Clean Energy facility of
$30.5 million drove the increase in net revenues within Other Operations. Net revenues increased
within Gas Transmission Operations as a result of increased firm capacity reservation revenues of
$20.8 million due in large part to the Columbia Gulf mainline pipeline being fully subscribed in
2007. Electric Operations net revenues were impacted by a $33.5 million settlement related to the
cost of power purchased by Northern Indiana in 2006 and 2007, lower industrial margins of $11.8
million, a $10.9 million adjustment for estimated unbilled revenues and higher revenue credits of
$5.1 million, which more than offset increases in net revenues due to higher wholesale margins and
volumes amounting to $19.6 million, favorable weather of approximately $17 million, higher
residential and commercial volumes attributable to usage and increased customers of approximately
$15.3 million and lower unrecoverable MISO costs of $7.1 million. Northern Indiana detected an
error in its unbilled revenue calculation and revised its estimate for unbilled electric and gas
revenues in the fourth quarter of 2007. Over a period of several years, Northern Indiana used
incorrect customer usage data to calculate its unbilled revenue. The unbilled revenue estimates
were never billed to customers and the error was corrected in the fourth quarter of 2007.

Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2006 were $3,124.6 million, a $22.0 million decrease compared with 2005, which
includes the impact of $55.3 million of trackers discussed above. The change was principally
driven by unfavorable weather compared to 2005, which impacted Gas Distribution Operations net
revenues by approximately $89 million as NiSource’s gas markets experienced 14% warmer weather
compared to 2005, and decreased Electric Operations net revenues by approximately $21 million due
to the northern Indiana electric market experiencing a 24% cooler summer compared to the 2005
summer cooling season. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues were also significantly affected
by decreased residential gas customer usage amounting to approximately $22 million. In addition,
2005’s results benefited from a third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection
of a shipper’s long term contract, which amounted to $8.9 million. These decreases in net revenues
were partially offset by increased sales of shorter-term transportation and storage services in Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations amounting to $43.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues
increased by $27.3 million as a result of a reduction in unrecoverable MISO costs included in costs
of sales, which included the impact of a favorable regulatory ruling on the recoverability of
certain MISO charges, timing of customer credits, proceeds from emission allowances, strong
industrial sales and customer growth.

Expenses

Operating expenses were $2,341.2 million in 2007, a $108.9 million increase from 2006, which
includes $21.0 million of increased expense that is recovered through regulatory trackers and
corresponding increases in net revenues (see discussion above). This increase was primarily due to
higher employee and administrative expenses of $68.7 million, higher expense within Electric
Operations for electric generation and storm damage restoration totaling $13.9 million, higher
depreciation of $10.0 million and increased other taxes of $13.5 million primarily due to property
taxes. The employee and administrative costs include payroll, benefits and higher corporate
services costs primarily related to the pricing structure under NiSource’s original business
services arrangement with IBM. In December 2007, NiSource and IBM finalized a restructuring of
their business services agreement. Under the restructured agreement, IBM will primarily provide
information technology services, with a number of other business service functions to be
transitioned back to the NiSource organization. The impact of the amended agreement with IBM
included a settlement charge of $9.8 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2007. Going
forward, NiSource will be in a position to more effectively manage its employee and administrative
expenses, while ensuring delivery of services needed to meet the company’s needs. These increases
in expenses were partially offset by the impact of a $17.0 million accrual recorded in fourth
quarter of 2006 in conjunction with the BP contract revision.


ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Operating expenses were $2,232.3 million in 2006, a $38.1 million increase from 2005, which
includes $55.3 million of increased expense that is recovered through regulatory trackers and
corresponding increases in net revenues (see discussion above). Excluding the impact of trackers, operating expenses decreased
primarily due to charges recorded in 2005. These included restructuring charges, transition costs,
pension and other postretirement benefit charges, and other costs associated with the IBM
outsourcing initiative totaling $82.8 million, a $10.9 million charge for obsolete software systems
and a $10.9 million impairment charge related to goodwill at Kokomo Gas. Operating expense
increases in 2006 included $18.1 million for certain legal matters, a $17 million accrual in
conjunction with the BP contract revision, higher employee and administrative expenses of
approximately $17 million, transition and other restructuring charges associated with the IBM
agreement of $12.3 million, generation and maintenance costs of $9.3 million in Electric
Operations, and higher property insurance premiums of $8.7 million mainly for offshore and onshore
facilities located in or near the Gulf of Mexico.

Equity Earnings (Loss) in Unconsolidated Affiliates

Equity Earnings (Loss) in Unconsolidated Affiliates increased 2007 operating income $9.4 million
compared to a loss of $12.3 million in 2006. Equity Earnings (Loss) in Unconsolidated Affiliates
includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and
Storage Operations business. Equity earnings increased $21.7 million due to Hardy Storage being
placed in service in April 2007, higher AFUDC earnings from Millennium and the impact of Millennium
recording a $13.0 million reserve in 2006 related to vacated portions of the original project.

In December 2006, Millennium received FERC approval for a pipeline project. The certificate order
approved certain project costs related to the construction and development of the Millennium
project. The order also approved the vacating of portions of the original September 2002
Millennium certificate that related to other facilities. The Millennium owners no longer believe
the recovery of the capitalized costs related to the vacated portions of the project is probable.
Therefore, Millennium fully reserved the capitalized costs related to the development of the
vacated portions and NiSource recorded a $13.0 million charge reflecting its share of Millennium’s
reserve during the fourth quarter of 2006. Equity Earnings (Loss) in Unconsolidated Affiliates
reduced 2006 income $12.3 million compared to earnings of $0.2 million in 2005.

Other Income (Deductions)

Other Income (Deductions) in 2007 reduced income $447.8 million compared to a reduction of $395.7
million in 2006. This increase in other deductions of $52.1 million was mainly due to a redemption
premium of $40.6 million related to the early extinguishment of long-term notes for Whiting Clean
Energy and to higher short-term interest rates and credit facility fees.

Other Income (Deductions) in 2006 reduced income $395.7 million compared to a reduction of $518.9
million in 2005. A loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt of $108.6 million during 2005
and decreased interest expense of $32.7 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to the refinancing of
$2.4 billion in long-term debt at lower rates during 2005 drove the decrease in other deductions.
Other, net was a loss of $6.5 million for 2006 compared to income of $14.0 million for the
comparable 2005 period due to lower interest income and increased costs associated with the sale of
accounts receivable. Higher fees, due to higher interest rates, and increased levels of accounts
receivable balances resulted in the higher expenses associated with the sale of accounts
receivable.

Income Taxes

Income taxes increased by $1.3 million in 2007 as compared with 2006. Income taxes increased $21.2
million in 2006 as compared with 2005 primarily due to higher pre-tax income from the prior year.
The effective income tax rates were 35.6%, 35.3% and 34.5% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2007 versus 2006 is due to increased state income
tax expense, offset by higher Section 199 deductions, lower regulatory flow-through depreciation
and the capitalization of the tax impact of AFUDC-Equity to a regulatory asset. The overall
effective tax rate increase in 2006 versus 2005 was due to favorable state and federal income tax
adjustments recorded in 2005 and a reduction in the electric production deduction and low income
housing credits from those recorded in 2005. The increase was partially offset by a lower
effective state income tax rate in 2006 due to a reduction in deferred state income tax
liabilities.


ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, signed into law on October 22, 2004, created new Internal
Revenue Code Section 199 which, beginning in 2005, permits taxpayers to claim a deduction from
taxable income attributable to certain domestic production activities. Northern Indiana and
Whiting Clean Energy’s electric production activities qualify for this deduction. The deduction
for the current year is 6% of QPAI, with certain limitations. This deduction was 3% of QPAI for
years 2005 and 2006 and increases to 9% of QPAI beginning in 2010 and
thereafter. The tax benefit for the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction claimed in NiSource’s
2006 consolidated federal income tax return was $1.5 million and is estimated to be $2.7 million
for 2007.

Discontinued Operations

Discontinued operations reflected income of $9.4 million, or $0.03 per basic share, in 2007, an
after-tax loss of $31.7 million, or $0.11 loss per basic share, in 2006, and income of $22.7
million, or $0.08 per basic share, in 2005. The $9.4 million of income from discontinued
operations in 2007 includes a $7.5 million reduction, net of taxes, in the liability for
unrecognized tax benefits and $0.9 million in related interest, net of taxes, associated with
the issuance of additional tax guidance in the first quarter of 2007. Also included is a
reduction in interest expense of $0.6 million, net of taxes, related to the completion of the
NiSource consolidated 2003 and 2004 tax audit.

The loss from discontinued operations in 2006 was primarily the result of an increase to legal
reserves and the sale of certain low-income housing investments. Results from discontinued
operations in 2005, net of taxes, include a gain on disposition of discontinued operations of
$43.5 million partially offset by a loss from discontinued operations of $20.8 million. The
gain on disposition of discontinued operations, net of taxes, resulted from changes to
reserves for contingencies related primarily to the previous sales of IWC, former Primary
Energy subsidiaries and other dispositions. The loss from discontinued operations in 2005
included changes to reserves for contingencies primarily related to CER and an impairment of
assets related to Transcom.

Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2006 of $0.4 million, net of taxes,
resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 123R. Refer to Note 14, “Stock-Based
Compensation,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 123R.

The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2005 of a $0.3 million loss, net of
taxes, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. Refer to Note 6, “Asset
Retirement Obligations,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

A significant portion of NiSource’s operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas
transportation and electric distribution businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash
flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts
from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer
months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business
during the summer cooling season and external short-term and long-term financing, is used to
purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of
facilities.

Beginning in 2007, capital expenditures and other investing activities began increasing due to age
and condition replacement programs and an increase in growth projects (see discussion below).
Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded via a combination of cash flow from
operations, expected proceeds from the initial public offering of the new MLP and new long-term
debt issuances.

Operating Activities

Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 was $757.2
million, a decrease of $399.0 million from a year ago. The impacts of gas prices and weather
significantly impact working capital changes. High gas prices and 5% colder than normal weather in
the fourth quarter of 2005 drove significantly higher than normal accounts receivable and
unrecovered gas costs balances that were subsequently collected in 2006. Conversely, the fourth
quarter of 2006 was 18% warmer than normal, leading to relatively lower accounts

receivable and unrecovered gas cost balances at December 31, 2006 and less cash to be collected in
2007. Beyond the changes in working capital, increases in net income and changes in deferred tax
balances totaling $169.1 million improved net cash flow from operating activities in 2007 relative
to 2006.

Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding.

In 2008, NiSource expects to make contributions of
approximately $17.1 million to its pension plans and approximately $38.3 million to its
postretirement medical and life plans.

For 2007, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $783.2 million, an
increase of 134.8 million over 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures
within Electric Operations of $90.3 million. This increase was primarily due to incremental
expenditures at the Electric Operations segment which included higher expenditures for the NOx
reduction programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation including
significant scheduled maintenance work on the Bailly Generating Station Unit 7 for a cyclone burner
replacement and other work to improve unit reliability. Additionally, construction also started on
installation of selective catalytic reduction equipment on Bailly Unit 7, with the in-service date
for the selective catalytic reduction targeted for the spring of 2008.

Capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
increased by $19.3 million and $18.7 million, respectively. The increase within Gas Distribution
Operations segment was due to work completed on the Southwest Delaware County supply line which
improved service to a high growth area in the Columbia of Ohio territory. Gas Distribution
Operations also experienced incremental capital spending for replacement and betterment of bare
steel and cast iron gas mains in the Columbia of Pennsylvania territory. The increase within the
Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment was primarily due to incremental pipeline
expenditures including pipeline integrity costs in compliance with the DOT’s Integrity Management
Rule. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment also invested in new business
initiatives to maintain and expand market share in storage and interstate transportation. Capital
expenditures in the Other Operations segment mainly comprise partnership investments and
enterprise-wide information technology infrastructure improvement.

For 2008 the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be
$1,356.9 million, which is $573.7 million higher than the 2007 level. This higher spending is
mainly due to the acquisition of additional electric generation capacity, replacement of bare steel
and cast iron facilities at certain distribution
companies and an increase in expenditures for growth projects primarily within Gas Transmission and
Storage Operations. The program is expected to be funded via a combination of cash flow from
operations, expected

NiSource Inc.

proceeds from the initial public offering of the new MLP and new long-term
debt issuances during 2008. Capital expenditures during the period 2008 through 2012 are expected
to be significantly higher than recent years. This is due primarily to increased replacement of
bare steel and cast iron mains in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased expenditure
for growth projects in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment.

Financing Activities

On December 21, 2007, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for an unspecified
principal amount of debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. NiSource is
classified as a well-known seasoned issuer and the registration statement will be effective for
three years.

Long-term Debt.

On December 31, 2007, Whiting Clean Energy redeemed $292.1 of its notes due June
20, 2011, having an average interest rate of 8.30%. The associated redemption premium of $40.6
million was charged to loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt. The redemption was financed
with NiSource borrowings.

On December 3, 2007, Capital Markets redeemed $72.0 million of its $75.0 million of 6.78% senior
notes due December 1, 2027. The notes contained a provision entitling holders to require Capital
Markets to purchase the notes at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest on December 1,
2007.

On October 31, 2007, Northern Indiana redeemed $24.0 million of its Variable Rate Demand Pollution
Control Refunding Bonds, Series 1988D, issued by Jasper County, Indiana on behalf of Northern
Indiana with a floating interest rate of 3.645% at time of redemption.

On August 31, 2007, NiSource Finance issued $800.0 million of 6.40%, 10.5-year senior unsecured
notes that mature March 15, 2018. The proceeds were used to repay short-term bank borrowings, to
fund the redemption of $24 million of Northern Indiana variable rate pollution control bonds due
November 2007, and for capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. The short-term bank
borrowings were previously used to fund the redemption of Northern Indiana’s preferred stock in
2006, having a total redemption value of $81.6 million, and for the repayment of an aggregate
$503.5 million of long-term debt in 2006 and the first nine months of 2007.

During August 2007, Northern Indiana redeemed $20.0 million of its medium-term notes with an
average interest rate of 6.77%.

During June 2007, Northern Indiana redeemed $12.0 million of its medium-term notes with an interest
rate of 7.25%.

During April 2007, NiSource redeemed $27.0 million of Capital Markets medium-term notes, with an
average interest rate of 7.49%.

During November 2006, NiSource redeemed $144.4 million of its senior debentures with an interest
rate of 3.628%. Also during November 2006, NiSource Finance redeemed $250.0 million of its
unsecured notes with an interest rate of 3.20%.

During May 2006, NiSource redeemed $25.0 million of Capital Markets medium-term notes, with an
average interest rate of 7.50%.

During April 2006, NiSource redeemed $15.0 million of Capital Markets medium-term notes, with an
average interest rate of 7.75%.

Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds.

Northern Indiana has seven series of Jasper County
Pollution Control Bonds with a total principal value of $254 million currently outstanding. Each of
the series are remarketed in auctions that take place at either 7, 28, or 35 day intervals. Between
February 13, 2008 and February 20, 2008, Northern Indiana received notice that five separate market
auctions of four of the series of the Jasper County Pollution Control Bonds had failed. The failed
auctions represented an aggregate principal value of $112 million.
The most recent auctions on February 20, 2008 and February 21, 2008 were successful, but resulted
in interest rates of 11.96% and 10.47%, respectively, which are well in excess of historical rates.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

These auction failures are attributable to the recent lack of liquidity in auction rate securities
market, largely driven by the recent turmoil in the bond insurance market. The Northern Indiana
Pollution Control Bonds are insured by Ambac Assurance Corporation and MBIA Insurance Corporation.

Under the Pollution Control Bond financing documents, Northern Indiana must pay a default rate of
interest of between 15%-18% to existing investors whenever the periodic auction process fails.
Northern Indiana is currently exploring options to avoid a full refunding of these securities and
restore competitive market-based interest rates. NiSource does not believe this issue will have a
material impact on its financial results.

Cumulative Preferred Stock.

On April 14, 2006, Northern Indiana redeemed all of its outstanding
cumulative preferred stock, having a total redemption value of $81.6 million.

Credit Facilities.

During July 2006, NiSource Finance amended its $1.25 billion five-year
revolving credit facility increasing the aggregate commitment level to $1.5 billion, extending the
termination date by one year to July 2011, and reduced the cost of borrowing. The amended facility
will help maintain a reasonable cushion of short-term liquidity in anticipation of continuing
volatile natural gas prices.

NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $1,061.0 million at December 31,
2007, at a weighted average interest rate of 5.43%, and borrowings of $1,193.0 million at December
31, 2006, at a weighted average interest rate of 5.68%.

As of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, NiSource Finance had $110.4 million and $81.9
million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2007, $24.1
million of the $110.4 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate
bi-lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource Finance obtained during
February 2004. Of the remaining $86.3 million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding at
December 31, 2007, $83.0 million resided under NiSource Finance’s five-year credit facility and
$3.3 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution.

As of December 31, 2007, $356.0 million of credit was available under the credit facility.

Debt Covenants.

NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five-year revolving credit
facility. NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of
December 31, 2007, the ratio was 56.9%.

NiSource is also subject to certain other non-financial covenants under the revolving credit
facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on
NiSource’s assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests,
preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset
sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and/or transfer of NiSource’s assets to no more
than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facility also includes a
cross-default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event
of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries
in a principal amount of $50 million or more.

NiSource’s bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However,
NiSource’s bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured
payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on
NiSource’s assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests,
preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at either 5% or 10% of
NiSource’s consolidated net tangible assets.

Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables.

On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to
sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CORC, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement with Dresdner
Bank AG, also dated May 14, 2004, under the terms of which it sells an undivided percentage
ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. On July 1, 2006, the
agreement was amended to increase the program limit from $300
million to $350 million. The agreement currently expires on June 27, 2008. As of December 31,
2007, $202.4 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping
and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives
a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services.

On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of
its trade receivables, as they originate, to NRC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana.
NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement with Citibank, N.A. under the terms of which it sells an
undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit.
The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. NRC’s
agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled expiration date of December 29, 2008,
and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2007, NRC had sold
$200 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new
receivables if Northern Indiana’s debt rating falls below BBB- or Baa3 at Standard and Poor’s or
Moody’s, respectively.

Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and
cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which
provides adequate compensation, for such services.

Credit Ratings.

On December 18, 2007, Standard and Poor’s lowered its senior unsecured ratings for
NiSource and its subsidiaries to BBB-. Standard and Poor’s outlook for NiSource and all of its
subsidiaries is stable. On December 3, 2007, Moody’s Investors Services affirmed the senior
unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries.
Moody’s changed its ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries to negative from stable. On
July 10, 2007, Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB+
ratings for Northern Indiana. Fitch’s outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable.
Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, an additional downgrade by Standard and
Poor’s or Moody’s would result in a rating that is below investment grade.

Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased
collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB- by
Standard and Poor’s or Baa3 by Moody’s. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the
ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $40 million. In addition to agreements with
ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse
change” provisions that could result in additional credit support such as letters of credit and
cash collateral to transact business.

Columbia Energy Services is the principal for two surety bonds issued to guarantee performance in
two separate long-term gas supply agreements. The surety, in accordance with the terms of its
indemnity agreements, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of
approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2007, the
total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $24.1 million. The
agreement will expire on December 31, 2008.

NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for the fixed-rate
debt, interest is calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable-rate
debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2007. For 2008, NiSource
projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $410 million, which
includes $340 million of interest payments related to its long-term debt outstanding as of December
31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, NiSource also had $1,061.0 million in short-term borrowings
outstanding.

NiSource’s subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical
quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent minimum quantities of
these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices.

NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and
storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2008 to 2027, require
NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges.

In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad
range of business process and support services to NiSource. On December 12, 2007, NiSource
Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM. Under the amended agreement, NiSource will
reassume responsibility for business support functions including human resource administration,
payroll, accounts payable, supply chain (procurement), sales centers, and the majority of meter to
cash operations (billing and collections). During 2007, NiSource had already begun to bring certain
finance and accounting functions back within the company. These functions include general
accounting, fixed asset accounting, and budgeting. In the Customer Contact Centers, interim
operational responsibility will be retained by IBM, although NiSource intends to pursue a direct
arrangement with Vertex, which currently operates the contact center as a subcontractor for IBM.
IBM will retain responsibility for information technology operations. Support functions returning
to NiSource will be transitioned in a phased approach throughout 2008. NiSource Corporate Services
will continue to pay IBM for the amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges,
with the variable charges fluctuating based actual need for such services. Based on the currently
projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $770
million to IBM in service fees and project costs over the remaining 7.5 year term, of which $5.8
million is reflected as capital lease payment in the table above. Under the original agreement,
NiSource Corporate Services expected to pay IBM approximately $1.6 billion in services fees and
project cost over ten years.

Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by
IBM), NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee,
repayment of IBM’s un-recovered capital investments, and IBM wind-down expense. This termination
fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of
the termination.

NiSource Inc.

Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation
services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various
periods through 2013 and are included within, “Other service obligations,” in the table of
contractual commitments.

Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products
and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under
this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a
combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various
performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana
terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty-year contract period. Estimated minimum
payments for this agreement are included within, “Other service obligations,” in the table of
contractual commitments.

Whiting Clean Energy has a service agreement with General Electric for certain operation and
maintenance activities for its cogeneration facility located at BP’s Whiting, Indiana refinery for
which certain minimum fees are required. The agreement extends through 2023 and is included
within, “Other service obligations,” in the table of contractual commitments. The agreement
provides for a $10 million termination penalty to be paid by Whiting Clean Energy to General
Electric to buy out or otherwise terminate the agreement.

NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline
business software requiring equal annual payments of $5.0 million per annual period over 10 years
beginning in January 2008. While this software was not placed in service as of December 31, 2007,
testing was substantially completed and NiSource Corporate Services did not have the ability to
terminate the agreement without cause. Final acceptance of the software installation was made on
January 2, 2008 and the software is expected to be placed in service in first half of 2008. The
payments associated with this license agreement is included within, “Other service obligations,” in
the table of contractual commitments.

NiSource’s expected payments related to other long-term liabilities includes employer contributions
to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2008. Plan contributions
beyond 2008 are dependant upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which
cannot be reliably estimated. In 2008, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately
$17.1 million to its pension plans and approximately $38.3 million to its postretirement medical
and life plans. See Note 11, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Not included in the table above are $4.0 million of estimated federal and state income tax
liabilities, including interest, recorded in accordance with FIN 48. If or when such amounts may
be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. See Note 10, “Income Taxes,” in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to
long-term obligations classified as, “Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits,” on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets, other than those described above.

NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll,
sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $550
million in 2008.

Off Balance Sheet Items

As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements
providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries.
Such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit.

NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $548.8 million of commodity-related
payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy commodity contracts and to satisfy
requirements under forward gas sales agreements of current and former subsidiaries. These
guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial
transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist

NiSource Inc.

under the commodity-related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $80.0 million, which guarantee
performance of the seller’s covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and
warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees
are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource
would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the
aforementioned guarantees is remote.

NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 18-B, “Guarantees and Indemnities,” in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSource’s off
balance sheet arrangements.

Market Risk Disclosures

Risk is an inherent part of NiSource’s energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly
and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk
involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify,
assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following
principal risks that are involved in NiSource’s energy businesses: commodity market risk,
interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi-faceted process
with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment
and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSource’s senior management takes an
active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that
require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification,
assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and
complex nature of the energy business, NiSource’s risk management policies and procedures
continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification.

Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSource’s market and credit
risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from
changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level.

Commodity Price Risk

NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries’ operations involving
natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSource’s subsidiaries use derivatives,
including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative
energy trading activity.

Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSource’s rate-regulated subsidiaries
is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas
costs through the rate-making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments.
If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing
services without the benefit of the traditional rate-making process and may be more exposed to
commodity price risk. Some of NiSource’s rate-regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price
risk products to its customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage
under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products
and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.

TPC, on behalf of Whiting Clean Energy, enters into power and gas derivative contracts to manage
commodity price risk associated with operating Whiting Clean Energy. These derivative contracts do
not always receive hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133 and variances in earnings could be
recognized as a result of marking these derivatives to market.

During 2007 and 2006, gains of $0.3 million and $0.1 million, net of taxes respectively, were
recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as
hedges. No amounts were recognized in earnings in 2007 and 2006 due to losses on derivatives
classified as trading. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and
settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts
currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately $23.5 million, net
of

NiSource Inc.

taxes. Refer to Note 8, “Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSource’s various derivative programs
for managing commodity price risk.

Interest Rate Risk

NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings
under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes,
which have interest rates that are indexed to short-term market interest rates. NiSource is also
exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed-to-variable interest rate
swaps that hedge the fair value of long-term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt
obligations subject to fluctuations in short-term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease)
in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest
expense by $27.2 million and $25.3 million for the years 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource
Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six
counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being
amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an
effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively.

NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics
of its outstanding long-term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance
entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million
with six counterparties having a 6 1/2-year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based
upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6-month BBA
LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of
the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009.

On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in
a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11-year term. NiSource Finance
will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount
based on U.S. 6-month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of
premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the
swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013.

As a result of these fixed-to-variable interest rate swap transactions, $1,160 million of NiSource
Finance’s existing long-term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates.

Credit Risk

Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSource’s business
activities. NiSource’s extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. Written
guidelines approved by NiSource’s Risk Management Committee document the management approval levels
for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation procedures.
Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent
of commercial operations. Credit risk arises with the possibility that a customer, supplier or
counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before
the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when
counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from
the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current
obligations and the market value of forward positions. Current credit exposure is generally
measured by the notional or principal value of obligations and direct credit substitutes, such as
commitments, stand-by letters of credit and guarantees. In determining exposure, NiSource
considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk.

Market Risk Measurement

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates,
indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in
losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one-day VaR at a 95%
confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a
variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market
exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was zero during 2007. The daily
market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was
$0.1 million, $0.2 million and zero during 2007, respectively. Prospectively, management has set
the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management
actions to reduce portfolio risk. The VaR limit for power trading


ITEM 7.

NiSource Inc.

was reduced to zero in the third quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts
outstanding at that time. Power and gas derivative contracts entered into to manage price risk
associated with Whiting Clean Energy are limited to quantities surrounding the physical generation
capacity of Whiting Clean Energy and the gas requirements to operate the facility.

Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies” included in this Item 7 and Note 1-U, “Accounting for Risk
Management and Energy Trading Activities,” and Note 8, “Risk Management and Energy Trading
Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSource’s
risk management.

Other Information

Critical Accounting Policies

NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below
that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSource’s results of operations
and Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.

SFAS No. 71 provides that rate-regulated
subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of
the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the
costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that
such rates can be charged and collected. NiSource’s rate-regulated subsidiaries follow the
accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to
utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in
service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets
and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,261.2 million and $1,582.4
million at December 31, 2007, and $1,563.2 million and $1,551.0 million at December 31, 2006,
respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1-F, “Basis of Accounting for
Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its
costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the
criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write-down of all or a portion of
NiSource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is
approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally
accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during
such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable
amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required
to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In management’s opinion, NiSource’s regulated
subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future.

Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets require
specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of
these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for
deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory
action amounted to $314.4 million at December 31, 2007. If NiSource determined that the amounts
included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be
required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts.

Accounting for Risk Management Activities.

Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the
fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation.
Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated
other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature
of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective
portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income and are
recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges,
the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value
of the hedged item. As a result of the rate-making process, the rate-regulated subsidiaries
generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or
losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains
and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the
hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness
test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout
the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded
currently in earnings.

Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate
certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is
such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the
underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange-traded natural gas futures and options
contracts and over-the-counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its
natural-gas-related businesses. NiSource had $127.4 million and $287.6 million of price risk
management assets, of which $113.5 million and $286.4 million related to hedges, at December 31,
2007 and 2006, respectively, and $82.0 million and $297.6 million of price risk management
liabilities, of which $55.1 million and $235.3 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to accumulated other comprehensive
income, net of taxes, was $7.6 million and $31.4 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Pensions and Postretirement Benefits.

NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and
other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, SFAS No. 88 and SFAS
No. 106, as amended by SFAS No. 158. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense
related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be
used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long-term returns on plan assets and employee
longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long-term nature of the
associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have
material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For
further discussion of NiSource’s pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 11, “Pension
and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Goodwill Impairment Testing

.

As of December 31, 2007, NiSource had $3.7 billion of goodwill on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, which was mainly due to the acquisition of Columbia. NiSource performs
its annual impairment test of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142 in June. For the purpose of
testing for impairment the goodwill recorded in the acquisition of Columbia, the related
subsidiaries were aggregated into two distinct reporting units, one within the Gas Distribution
Operations segment and one within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. NiSource
uses the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for the
purpose of this test. Refer to Notes 1-J and 5, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Long-lived Asset Impairment Testing

. NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long-lived
assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under SFAS No.
71. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired as
per SFAS No. 144. When an asset’s carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash
flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the
asset’s fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1-K, “Long-lived Assets,” in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Contingencies.

A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental,
tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated.
Accounting for contingencies require significant management judgment regarding the estimated
probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and
associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and
regulations. Management’s assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of
future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates
and can have a material impact on NiSource’s results of operations and financial position. Refer
to Note 18, “Other Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.

Asset Retirement Obligations.

NiSource accounts for retirement obligations under the provisions of
SFAS No. 143, as amended by FIN 47, which require entities to record the fair value of a liability
for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted
market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value
techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the

NiSource Inc.

amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and
credit-adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes
the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the
liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related
asset. The rate-regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amount recognized for
depreciation and accretion and the amount collected in rates as required pursuant to SFAS No. 71
for those amounts it has collected in rates or expects to collect in future rates. Refer to Note
6, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS No. 158 – Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158 to improve existing reporting for defined benefit
postretirement plans by requiring employers to recognize in the statement of financial position the
overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan, among other changes.

In the fourth quarter of 2006, NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158. Based on the
measurement of the various defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans’ assets and
benefit obligations at September 30, 2006, the pretax impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 decreased
intangible assets by $46.5 million, decreased deferred charges and other assets by $1.1 million,
increased regulatory assets by $538.8 million, increased accumulated other comprehensive income by
$239.8 million and increased accrued liabilities for postretirement and postemployment benefits by
$251.4 million. In addition, NiSource recorded a reduction in deferred income taxes of
approximately $96 million. With the adoption of SFAS No. 158 NiSource determined that for certain
rate-regulated subsidiaries the future recovery of pension and other postretirement plans costs is
probable in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 71. These rate-regulated subsidiaries
recorded regulatory assets and liabilities that would otherwise have been recorded to accumulated
other comprehensive income.

On January 1, 2007, NiSource adopted the SFAS No. 158 measurement date provisions requiring
employers to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the fiscal year-end. The pre-tax
impact of adopting the SFAS No. 158 measurement date provisions increased deferred charges and
other assets by $9.4 million, decreased regulatory assets by $89.6 million, decreased retained
earnings by $11.3 million, increased accumulated other comprehensive income by $5.3 million and
decreased accrued liabilities for postretirement and postemployment benefits by $74.2 million.
NiSource also recorded a reduction in deferred income taxes of approximately $2.6 million. In
addition, 2007 expense for pension and postretirement benefits reflects the updated measurement
date valuations.

FIN 48 – Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48 to
reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement
requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, this interpretation requires
that a tax position meet a “more-likely-than-not recognition threshold” for the benefit of an
uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements and requires that benefit to be
measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon
ultimate settlement. The determination of whether a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold is based on whether it is probable of being sustained on audit by the
appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position.
Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006.

On January 1, 2007, NiSource adopted the provisions of FIN 48. As a result of the implementation
of FIN 48, NiSource recognized a charge of $0.8 million to the opening balance of retained
earnings. Refer to Note 10, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.

SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) – Share-Based Payment.

Effective January 1, 2006, NiSource adopted
SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method. SFAS No. 123R requires measurement
of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition
of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. In accordance with the
modified prospective transition method, NiSource’s consolidated financial statements for prior
periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS No. 123R. Prior
to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, NiSource applied the intrinsic value method of APB No.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

25 for awards granted under its stock-based compensation plans and complied with the disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 123.

When it adopted SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2006, NiSource recognized a cumulative effect
of change in accounting principle of $0.4 million, net of income taxes, which reflected the net
cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather
than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. Other than the requirement for
expensing stock options, outstanding share-based awards will continue to be accounted for
substantially as they are currently. Refer to Note 14, “Share-Based Compensation,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS No. 157 – Fair Value Measurements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 to define
fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and to expand disclosures about fair
value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007
and should be applied prospectively, with limited exceptions. NiSource will adopt this standard
in the first quarter of 2008. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of this
interpretation and does not anticipate a material impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

SFAS No. 159 – The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Including an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 which permits
entities to choose to measure certain financial instruments at fair value that are not currently
required to be measured at fair value. Upon adoption, a cumulative adjustment will be made to
beginning retained earnings for the initial fair value option remeasurement. Subsequent unrealized
gains and losses for fair value option items will be reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and should not be applied
retrospectively, except as permitted for certain conditions for early adoption. NiSource is
currently reviewing the provisions of SFAS No. 159 to determine whether to elect fair value
measurement for any of its financial assets or liabilities when it adopts this standard in 2008.

SFAS No. 141R – Business Combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R to improve
the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of information that a reporting
entity provides in its financial reports regarding business combinations and its effects, including
recognition of assets and liabilities, the measurement of goodwill and required disclosures. This
Statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
on or after December 15, 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited. NiSource is currently reviewing
the provisions of SFAS No. 141R to determine the impact on future business combinations.

SFAS No. 160 — Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment of ARB
No. 51.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 to improve the relevance, comparability,
and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated
financial statements regarding non-controlling ownership interests in a business and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This Statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and earlier adoption is
prohibited. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of SFAS No. 160 to determine the impact
it may have on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

FSP FIN 39-1 — FASB Staff Position Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39.

In April 2007, the
FASB posted FSP FIN 39-1 to amend paragraph 3 of FIN 39 to replace the terms

conditional contracts

and e

xchange contracts

with the term

derivative instruments

as defined in SFAS No. 133. This FSP
also amends paragraph 10 of FIN 39 to permit a reporting entity to offset fair value amounts
recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral
against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same
counterparty under a master netting arrangement. This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007, with early application permitted. NiSource is currently reviewing the
provisions of FSP FIN 39-1 to determine the impact it may have on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Environmental Matters

NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated
with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations,
certain LDCs and CER. More significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas
less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations
using mercury-containing measuring equipment.

The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination at known sites will depend upon many
factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, the range of technologies
that can be used for remediation, other potentially responsible parties and their financial
viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. NiSource’s environmental liability
includes those corrective action costs considered “probable and reasonably estimable” under SFAS
No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96-1. NiSource’s estimated remediation liability will be refined as
events in the remediation process occur and actual remediation costs may differ materially from
NiSource’s estimates due to the dependence on the factors listed above.

Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United
States and worldwide to reduce so-called “greenhouse gases” such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of
burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage
in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently
a participant in the EPA’s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in
developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

Bargaining Unit Contract

As of December 31, 2007, NiSource had 7,607 employees of which 3,384 were subject to collective
bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective
bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2007. In 2008, three collective bargaining
agreements, covering approximately 79 employees are set to expire.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued)

Competition

Gas Distribution Operations compete with investor-owned, municipal, and cooperative electric
utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas
utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong
competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas.
Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial
markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates
are primarily driven by low-cost, coal-fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas
competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets
mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane-based heating which, over time, has
comprised a declining percentage of the overall market.

Market Conditions

Spot prices for the winter of 2007-2008 were primarily in the range of $6.60 — $8.46/Dth. This was
an increase when compared to the prices experienced during the winter of 2006-2007 that were in the
$5.00-$8.00/Dth range, attributed mainly to late winter cold weather and slightly higher demand.

Entering the 2007-2008 winter season, storage levels were comparable to the prior year inventory
levels, which were at the high end of the five-year range, due in part to an increase in overall
storage capacity and the spread between summer and winter gas prices. During the summer of 2007,
prices ranged between $5.30 and $7.97/Dth. Through December 2007, the winter of 2007-2008 price
levels were primarily between $6.60 and $7.54/Dth while weather was generally normal.

All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state-approved recovery mechanisms that
provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as
pass-through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs
included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the
difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under-recovered or over-recovered gas
cost to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices,
throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a
result of higher gas cost.

The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non-traditional revenue sources within the
evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services
upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories
and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products
are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company
and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on-system
services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and
balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give
the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such
things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce
pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of
transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others
using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice
programs described below under “Regulatory Matters.”

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued)

The Gas Distribution Operations segment’s net capital expenditures and other investing activities
were $302.7 million in 2007 and are projected to be approximately $381.4 million in 2008. This
increase in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to higher spending for the replacement of
bare steel and cast iron pipe at certain distribution companies and an expected increase in
expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities as well as the implementation of a
standardized work management system at certain distribution companies as part of a multi-year plan.

Regulatory Matters

Significant Rate Developments.

On January 28, 2008, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate
case with the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, seeking an increase of approximately $60
million annually. On February 1, 2008, Columbia of Ohio filed its Notice of Intent to File An
Application For Increase in Rates. The Columbia of Ohio Application was filed on March 3, 2008,
requesting an increase in base rates in excess of $80 million.

At Bay State, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities approved a $5.9 million annual
increase in the company’s base rates, effective November 1, 2007, under the company’s
performance-based rate mechanism. On October 17, 2007, Bay State petitioned the Massachusetts
Department of Public Utilities to allow the company to collect an additional $7.5 million in annual
revenue related to usage reductions occurring since its last rate case. Bay State also requested
approval of a steel infrastructure tracker that would allow for recovery of ongoing infrastructure
replacement program investments. The Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities is scheduled to
hold hearings on this matter in the first quarter of 2008.

On August 29, 2007, the Kentucky Public Service Commission approved a stipulation and settlement,
authorizing Columbia of Kentucky to increase its base rates by $7.25 million annually.

On May 9, 2007, the IURC approved Northern Indiana’s petition to simplify rates, stabilize revenues
and provide for energy efficiency funding. The order adopts a new rate structure that enhances
Northern Indiana’s ability to increase revenues and provides incremental funding for an energy
efficiency program.

Cost Recovery and Trackers.

A significant portion of the distribution companies’ revenue is
related to the recovery of gas costs, the review and recovery of which occurs via standard
regulatory proceedings. All states require periodic review of actual gas procurement activity to
determine prudence and to permit the recovery of prudently incurred costs related to the supply of
gas for customers. NiSource distribution companies have historically been found prudent in the
procurement of gas supplies to serve customers.

Certain operating costs of the NiSource distribution companies are significant, recurring in
nature, and generally outside the control of the distribution companies. Some states allow the
recovery of such costs via cost tracking mechanisms. Such tracking mechanisms allow for
abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the distribution companies to implement charges and
recover appropriate costs. Tracking mechanisms allow for more timely recovery of such costs as
compared with more traditional cost recovery mechanisms. Examples of such mechanisms include gas
cost recovery adjustment mechanisms, tax riders, and bad debt recovery mechanisms. Gas
Distribution Operations revenue is increased by the implementation and recovery of costs via such
tracking mechanisms.

Comparability of Gas Distribution Operations line item operating results is impacted by these
regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt
expenses. Increases in the expenses that are the subject of trackers result in a corresponding
increase in net revenues and therefore have essentially no impact on total operating income
results.

Certain of the NiSource distribution companies are embarking upon plans to replace significant
portions of their operating systems that are nearing the end of their useful lives. Those
companies are currently evaluating requests for increases in rates in order to allow recovery of
the additional capital expenditures required for such plans. Each LDC’s approach to cost recovery
may be unique, given the different laws, regulations and precedent that exist in each jurisdiction.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued)

Certain types of natural gas risers, which are owned by customers, on Columbia of Ohio’s
distribution system have been evaluated under a study required by the PUCO, and have been found
prone to leak natural gas under certain conditions. On February 1, 2007, Columbia of Ohio
announced plans to identify and replace these risers on its distribution system. As of December
31, 2007, Columbia of Ohio deferred $5.9 million of costs associated with the study and
identification of these natural gas risers as a regulatory asset and currently has budgeted
approximately $142 million for the cost to identify and replace the risers. On October 26, 2007,
Columbia of Ohio and the PUCO Staff filed a Joint Stipulation and Recommendation that provided for
Columbia of Ohio’s assumption of financial responsibility for the repair or replacement of
customer-owned service lines and the replacement of risers prone to leak. In addition, the
Stipulation provides for Columbia of Ohio to capitalize its investment in the service lines and
risers, as well as the establishment of a tracking mechanism that would provide for the recovery of
operating and maintenance costs related to Columbia of Ohio’s capitalized investment and its
expenses incurred in identifying risers prone to leak. On December 28, 2007, Columbia of Ohio
entered into a Stipulation with the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel and Ohio Partners for Affordable
Energy, addressing the issues of Columbia of Ohio’s authority to assume responsibility for repair
or replacement of hazardous customer owned service lines, the establishment of accounting authority
for costs related to such activities, and the establishment of a mechanism to recover such costs.
The parties have recommended approval of the Stipulation to the PUCO.

On December 28, 2007, Columbia of Ohio entered into a Stipulation with the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel
and PUCO Staff and other stakeholders resolving litigation concerning a pending Gas Cost Recovery
audit of Columbia of Ohio. The Stipulation calls for an accelerated pass back to customers of
$36.6 million that will occur from January 31, 2008 through January 31, 2009, generated through
off-system sales and capacity release programs, the development of new energy efficiency programs
for introduction in 2009, and the development of a wholesale auction process for customer supply to
take effect in 2010. The Stipulation also resolves issues related to pending and future Gas Cost
Recovery Management Performance audits through 2008. The PUCO approved this agreement on January
23, 2008.

Customer Usage.

The NiSource distribution companies have experienced declining usage by customers,
due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to increases in commodity prices. A significant
portion of the LDC’s operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the
distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon
throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Many of NiSource’s LDCs are evaluating mechanisms that
would “de-couple” the recovery of fixed costs from throughput, and implement recovery mechanisms
that more closely link the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. Each of the states in which
the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such
changes.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of
December 31, 2007, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions.
Refer to Note 18-E, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment.

Restructuring

Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $0.7
million during 2007 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2007 was $0.9
million. In the third quarter of 2006, an adjustment was made to the restructuring reserve for
leased office space, reducing the reserve by $5.2 million. This adjustment was made in connection
with a reallocation of office space and assessment of office facilities. Refer to Note 3,
“Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations
segment.

Pending Sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas

On February 15, 2008, NiSource reached a definitive agreement under which Unitil Corporation will
acquire NiSource subsidiaries Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas for $160 million plus net
working capital at the time of closing. Historically, net working capital has averaged
approximately $25 million. Under the terms of the transaction, Unitil Corporation will acquire
Northern Utilities, a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44
communities in Maine and New Hampshire and Granite State Gas, an 86-mile FERC regulated gas

transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. The transaction, expected to
be complete by the end of 2008, is subject to federal and state regulatory approvals. During the
quarter ended March 31, 2008, NiSource expects to recognize an after tax loss of approximately $65
million related to the pending sale and to account for Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas as
discontinued operations.

NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the company’s larger
acquisition of Bay State. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Bay State as a core component of
the company’s long-term, investment-driven growth strategy.

Weather

In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer
demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree-days. Normal is evaluated using
heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for
measuring heating degree-days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load
begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62
degrees.

Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2007 was approximately 3% warmer
than normal and 11% colder than 2006, increasing net revenues by approximately $73 million for the
year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006.

Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2006 was approximately 12%
warmer than normal and 14% warmer than 2005, decreasing net revenues by approximately $89 million
for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005.

Throughput

Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2007 were 923.0 MMDth, compared
to 826.9 MMDth for 2006. This increase reflected higher sales to residential, commercial, and
industrial customers, which was attributable mainly to cooler weather, an increase in residential
and commercial customers and usage, and higher off-system sales.

Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2006 were 826.9 MMDth, compared
to 864.4 MMDth for 2005. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential, commercial, and
industrial customers, which was attributable mainly to the milder weather and decreased residential
customer usage, partially offset by increased off-system sales.

Net Revenues

Net revenues for 2007 were $1,521.7 million, an increase of $100.1 million from 2006. This
increase in net revenues was due primarily to the impact of cooler weather amounting to
approximately $73 million, a $15.8 million increase in revenues from regulatory trackers, which are
primarily offset in operating expense, increased revenues from regulatory initiatives and other
service programs of $10.9 million and approximately $8 million from customer growth. These
increases in net revenues were partially offset by an adjustment for estimated unbilled revenues of
$14.6 million. Northern Indiana detected an error in its unbilled revenue calculation and revised
its estimate for unbilled electric and gas revenues in the fourth quarter of 2007. Over a period
of several years, Northern Indiana used incorrect customer usage data to calculate its unbilled
revenue. The unbilled revenue estimates were never billed to customers and the error was corrected
in the fourth quarter of 2007.

Net revenues for 2006 were $1,421.6 million, a decrease of $83.3 million from 2005. This decrease
in net revenues was due primarily to the impact of warmer weather amounting to approximately $89
million and a decline in residential usage of approximately $22 million. Additionally, 2005
revenue was favorably impacted $12.1 million from a buyout of a large customer gas contract. These
decreases in net revenues were partially offset by a $46.7 million increase in revenues from
regulatory trackers, which are primarily offset in operating expenses.

Operating Income

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations
segment was $332.8 million, an increase of $42.8 million compared to the same period in 2006
primarily attributable to


ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued)

increased net revenues described above, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $57.3
million. The increase in operating expenses includes $14.9 million of expenses recoverable through
regulatory trackers that are primarily offset in revenues. Operating expenses also increased
primarily due to higher employee and administrative costs of $28.6 million, increased outside
service expense of $5.9 million, higher environmental reserves of $5.0 million, and increased
property taxes of $4.5 million. The comparable period last year was impacted by transition
expenses associated with the IBM agreement of $8.5 million partially offset by a reversal of a
restructuring reserve for leased office space of $5.2 million. The employee and administrative
costs include payroll, benefits and higher corporate services costs primarily related to the
pricing structure under NiSource’s original business services arrangement with IBM.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations
segment was $290.0 million, a decrease of $78.2 million compared to the same period in 2005 largely
attributable to reduced net revenues described above. The increase in operating expenses included
$50.5 million recoverable through regulatory trackers that are primarily offset in revenues. The
comparable 2005 period was impacted by transition costs, restructuring charges and a pension and
other postretirement benefits charge totaling $49.4 million associated with the IBM agreement, and
a $10.9 million goodwill impairment loss related to Kokomo Gas. Operating expenses were impacted
in 2006 by higher employee and administrative costs of $11.9 million, expenses associated with the
IBM agreement of $8.5 million primarily for transition services and higher depreciation expense of
$6.8 million, partially offset by a reversal in the third quarter of a restructuring reserve for
leased office space of $5.2 million and lower uncollectible accounts. The employee and
administrative costs include payroll, benefits and higher corporate services costs primarily
related to NiSource’s business services arrangement with IBM.

NiSource Energy Partners, L.P.

On December 21, 2007, NiSource Energy Partners, L.P., an MLP and subsidiary of NiSource, filed an
S-1 registration statement with the SEC in which it proposed making an initial public offering of
common units in the MLP and NiSource proposed contributing its interest in Columbia Gulf to the
MLP. NiSource management believes the formation of an MLP is a natural complement to NiSource’s
gas transmission and storage growth strategy, and should provide NiSource access to competitively
priced capital to support future growth investment.

Millennium Pipeline Project

Millennium received FERC approval for a pipeline project, in which Columbia Transmission is
participating, which will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn,
Ontario trading hub. The reconfigured project, which was approved by the FERC in a certificate
order issued December 21, 2006, will begin at an interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline
that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire
will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York.
Millennium will extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin at Ramapo, New York. The
Millennium partnership is currently made up of the following companies: Columbia Transmission
(47.5%), DTE Millennium (26.25%), and KeySpan Millennium (26.25%). Columbia Transmission is the
operator.

The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related
pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, and Iroquois collectively referred to as the
“Companion Pipelines.” The December 21, 2006 certificate order also granted the necessary project
approvals to the Companion Pipelines. Construction began on June 22, 2007 with a projected
in-service date of November 1, 2008.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued)

On August 29, 2007, Millennium entered into a bank credit agreement to finance the construction of
the Millennium Pipeline project. As a condition precedent to the credit agreement, NiSource issued
a guarantee securing payment for its indirect ownership interest percentage of amounts borrowed
under the financing agreement up until such time as the amounts payable under the agreement are
paid in full. The permanent financing is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2009.
Additional information on this guarantee is provided in Note 18-B, “Guarantees and Indemnities,” in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Hardy Storage Project

Hardy Storage completed its third full quarter of operations, receiving customer injections into
its new underground natural gas storage facility in West Virginia. Injections this year will allow
the field to deliver up to 150,000 Dth of natural gas per day during the 2008-2009 winter heating
season. Customers withdrew over 900,000 Dth from the storage field during the last two months of
2007. When fully operational in 2009, the field will have a working storage capacity of 12 billion
cubic feet, delivering more than 176,000 Dth of natural gas per day. Hardy Storage is a joint
venture of subsidiaries of Columbia Transmission and Piedmont.

Columbia Transmission, the operator of Hardy Storage, is expanding its natural gas transmission
system by 176,000 Dth per day to provide the capacity needed to deliver Hardy Storage supplies to
customer markets. Construction of these transmission facilities is substantially complete and
partially in service. The remainder will be placed in-service in the first half of 2008.

Eastern Market Expansion Project

On May 3, 2007, Columbia Transmission filed a certificate application before the FERC for approval
to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace
certain existing facilities. This Eastern Market Expansion project is projected to add 97,000 Dth
per day of storage and transportation capacity and is fully subscribed on a 15-year contracted firm
basis. On January 14, 2008, the FERC issued a favorable order which granted a certificate to
construct the project and the project is expected to be in service by spring 2009.

Ohio Storage Project

Columbia Transmission concluded successful open seasons to gauge customer interest in an expansion
of its storage in Ohio. The final scope of the project will be determined based on the outcome of
the ongoing customer discussions. This project was previously referred to as the Crawford Storage
Field project.

Other Growth Projects

Columbia Gulf recently expanded interconnection points to provide incremental delivery capacity of
30,000 Dth per day to Henry Hub and 85,000 Dth per day to Southern Natural Gas near Lafayette,
Louisiana. Columbia Gulf entered into firm contracts for this capacity and the facilities were
placed into service during the third quarter of 2007. A successful open season was held in the
first quarter of 2007 to sell capacity of 380,000 Dth per day to two interconnection points with
Transcontinental Gas Pipeline. This capacity provides increased access to downstream pipelines and
their customers that access mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets. These interconnection points were
placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2007.

An open season to solicit interest and contracts for expanded capacity on Columbia Gulf’s system
for delivery to Florida Gas Transmission was held in October and November 2007. This project is
currently in development based on customer interest expressed during the open season.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued)

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment’s capital expenditure program and other
investing activities are projected to be approximately $393.4 million in 2008. The increase in
capital is due to storage and transportation growth projects in key market areas which are served
by the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Refer to “Commercial Growth and Expansion
of the Gas Transmission and Storage Business” within Executive Summary for additional information
related to growth projects.

Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold

Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of
service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and
Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm
contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management
seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts.

Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between
certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a “capacity reservation” fee
based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an
incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from
firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues
are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high
percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue
fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near-term
supply and demand conditions. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 approximately 87.4% of
the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts
and 4.9% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is
compared to approximately 86.9% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation
fees paid under firm contracts and 4.2% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under
firm contracts for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006.

Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by
customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service.
These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to
provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and
customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline
facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive
prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service
is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission
assets. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately 7.7% and 8.9% of the
transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts, respectively.

Significant FERC Developments

On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the “Order on Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs.” This
guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for
accounting for the costs of implementing the DOT’s Integrity Management Rule. The effective date
of the guidance was January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs have been recorded as
operating expenses. The rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to
January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded.

Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission are cooperating with the FERC on an informal, non-public
investigation of certain operating practices regarding tariff services offered by those companies.
Although the companies are continuing to cooperate with the FERC in an effort to reach a
consensual settlement, it is likely that any settlement will require the payment of fines or
refunds.

Delhi Pipeline Rupture

On December 14, 2007, Columbia Gulf’s Line 100 ruptured approximately two miles north of its Delhi
Compressor Station in Louisiana. The damage to the pipeline forced Columbia Gulf to declare force
majeure because no gas was flowing through this portion of the pipeline system on Lines 100, 200
and 300 while a facility assessment was performed. As a result the current contractual
transportation agreements of 2.156 Bcf per day could not be met. By December 15, 2007 Lines 200
and 300 were returned to service and gas flow was restored to 2.0 Bcf per day on December 16, 2007.
On December 19, 2007, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a Corrective Action


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued)

Order which was applicable to Line 100 from the Rayne, LA Compressor Station to Leach, KY. The
Order required Columbia Gulf to develop a remedial work plan, which included assessments on Line
100 using in-line inspection tools. The Order also required a 20% reduction in pressure on Line
100 from the Rayne Compressor Station to the Corinth Compressor Station which resulted in a
reduction in gas flow on December 21, 2007 to 1.6 Bcf per day. The next day the capacity was
increased to 1.75 Bcf per day. Between December 22, 2007 and February 5, 2008 the capacity varied
between 1.6 and 1.75 Bcf per day as a result of remediation work on Line 100. On February 12, 2008,
Columbia Gulf submitted its proposed remedial work plan to the Department of Transportation, which
if accepted would allow Columbia Gulf to resume operating Line 100 at its maximum operating
pressure.

NiSource expects to recover a portion of the pipeline replacement costs plus business interruption
losses through insurance.

Hartsville Compressor Station

On February 5, 2008, a tornado struck Columbia Gulf’s Hartsville Compressor Station in Macon
County, Tennessee. The damage to the facility forced Columbia Gulf to declare force majeure
because no gas was flowing through this portion of the pipeline system while a facility assessment
was being performed and the current contractual transportation agreements of 2.156 Bcf per day
could not be met. Since that time Columbia Gulf has restored the majority of gas flow to 1.5 Bcf
per day, however full contractual agreements still cannot be met. Although temporary solutions are
being investigated to restore system capabilities as soon as possible, a permanent solution for
rebuilding the compressor station may take 18 to 24 months. Over the course of the next 24 months,
firm transportation contracts of approximately 1.1 Bcf per day will expire and there is a risk some
of those may not be renewed due to the reduced system capabilities.

NiSource expects the majority of the reconstruction costs of the compressor station and ancillary
facilities plus business interruption losses will be recoverable through insurance during the 18 to
24 month period.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
segment. As of December 31, 2007, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental
response actions. Refer to Note 18-E, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas
Transmission and Storage Operations segment.

Restructuring

Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
amounted to $1.7 million during 2007 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2007
was $1.3 million. Refer to Note 3, “Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives
for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment.

Pending Sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas

On February 15, 2008, NiSource reached a definitive agreement under which Unitil Corporation will
acquire NiSource subsidiaries Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas for $160 million plus net
working capital at the time of closing. Historically, net working capital has averaged
approximately $25 million. Under the terms of the transaction, Unitil Corporation will acquire
Northern Utilities, a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44
communities in Maine and New Hampshire and Granite State Gas, an 86-mile FERC regulated gas
transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. The transaction, expected to
be complete by the end of 2008, is subject to federal and state regulatory approvals. During the
quarter ended March 31, 2008, NiSource expects to recognize an after tax loss of approximately $65
million related to the pending sale and to account for Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas as
discontinued operations.

NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the company’s larger
acquisition of Bay State. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Bay State as a core component of
the company’s long-term, investment-driven growth strategy.

Throughput

Columbia Transmission’s throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and
other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid-Atlantic,
midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf
reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short-haul
transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads Pipeline serves
customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire,
Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines
within this segment.

Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,422.8 MMDth for 2007,
compared to 1,178.0 MMDth in 2006. The increase of 244.8 MMDth is due primarily to strong market
area storage injections, higher transport usage by natural gas fired electric power generators,
enhanced market access through new pipeline interconnects and the addition of new natural gas
supply attached to the system at Perryville, Louisiana.

Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,178.0 MMDth for 2006,
compared to 1,172.1 MMDth in 2005. The increase of 5.9 MMDth is due to increased sales of
shorter-term transportation and storage services described above, partially offset by lower gas
deliveries by Columbia Transmission.

Net Revenues

Net revenues were $870.5 million for 2007, an increase of $20.0 million from 2006. The increase in
net revenues was mainly due to higher firm capacity reservation revenues of $20.8 million and a
$6.6 million increase in revenues from regulatory trackers, which are offset in operating expense.
These increases in net revenues were partially offset by a decrease in shorter-term transportation
services and storage optimization revenues of $5.9 million.

Net revenues were $850.5 million for 2006, an increase of $40.0 million from 2005. The increase in
net revenues was mainly due to sales of shorter-term transportation and storage services amounting
to $43.9 million and increased subscriptions for demand services of $12.8 million. The comparable
period in 2005 benefited from a third-party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection
of a shipper’s long-term contract, which amounted to $8.9 million.

Operating Income

Operating income of $362.0 million in 2007 increased $21.2 million from 2006 primarily due to the
increase in net revenues described above and equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates of $9.4
million for 2007 compared to a loss of $12.3 million in unconsolidated affiliates in the 2006
period, partially offset by increased operating expenses of $20.5 million. Equity earnings in
unconsolidated affiliates increased $21.7 million due to Hardy Storage being placed in service in
April 2007, higher AFUDC earnings from Millennium and the impact of Millennium recording a reserve
in 2006 related to vacated portions of the original project. Operating expenses increased
primarily as a result of higher employee and administrative costs of $14.0 million, a $7.2 million
impairment charge related to base gas at a storage field and increased tracker expenses of $6.6
million, which are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. The employee and administrative
costs include payroll, benefits and higher corporate services costs primarily related to NiSource’s
business services arrangement with IBM. These increases in operation and maintenance expenses were
partially offset by a $6.4 million reduction of a reserve for legal matters and the impact of a
$4.6 million expense recognized in 2006 related to the settlement of a certain legal matter.

Operating income of $340.8 million in 2006 decreased $3.6 million from 2005 primarily due to
increased operations and maintenance expenses of $30.2 million and a $12.3 million loss on equity
earnings in unconsolidated affiliates, which offset the increase in net revenues described above.
The loss on equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates resulted from a $13.0 million charge
reflecting NiSource’s Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment share of Millennium’s reserve
related to vacated portions of the original project. Operation and maintenance expenses increased
as a result of $18.1 million accrued for litigation relating to several matters, some which were
settled during the fourth quarter of 2006, higher employee and administrative costs of $9.4
million, increased pipeline integrity related costs of $7.3 million, and increased property
insurance premiums of $6.5 million mainly for offshore and onshore facilities located in or near
the Gulf of Mexico. The increases in property insurance were driven by the losses experienced by
the insurance industry over the past few years, resulting from hurricanes such as Ivan, Katrina and
Rita. The operation and maintenance expense increases were partially offset by the impact in the

Electric Supply

On November 1, 2007, Northern Indiana filed its bi-annual IRP with the IURC. The plan showed the
need to add approximately 1,000 mw of new capacity. Additionally, during November 2007, Northern
Indiana filed a CPCN as well as contracts to purchase power generated with renewable energy,
specifically with wind. The CPCN requested approval to purchase two CCGT power plants — the
Whiting Clean Energy facility owned by PEI, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, and the Sugar
Creek facility located in west central Indiana and owned by LS Power Group. On December 22, 2007,
BP indicated it would exercise a contractual right of first refusal to purchase the Whiting Clean
Energy facility. Whiting Clean Energy is in discussions with BP regarding several aspects of the
offer. As a


ITEM 7.

result, on January 25, 2008, Northern Indiana filed an amended CPCN to address just the Sugar Creek
CCGT facility. The estimated cost of the facility is $329 million. Northern Indiana is requesting
the IURC and the FERC to approve the purchase by the second quarter of 2008.

Market Conditions

The regulatory frameworks applicable to Electric Operations continue to be affected by fundamental
changes that will impact Electric Operations’ structure and profitability. Notwithstanding those
changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and
revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing
environment.

Northern Indiana’s sales to steel-related industries accounted for approximately 64% of its total
industrial sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Northern Indiana’s
industrial sales volumes and revenues have remained essentially flat from 2006 levels. The U.S.
steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international
competition, increased costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has
responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position
in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered
production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international
producers and those in the United States.

planned acquisition of additional electric generation capacity.

Regulatory Matters

Significant Rate Developments.

To settle a proceeding regarding Northern Indiana’s request to
recover intermediate dispatchable power costs, Northern Indiana has agreed to file an electric base
rate case on or before July 1, 2008.

During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate
review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement.
The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will
receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year. The credits will continue at
approximately the same annual level and per the same methodology, until the IURC enters a base rate
order that approves revised Northern Indiana electric rates. The order included a rate moratorium
that expired on July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a
specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated
based on electric usage; therefore, in times of high usage the credit may be more than $55.1
million. Credits amounting to $56.0 million, $50.9 million and $58.5 million were recognized for
electric customers for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

MISO.

As part of Northern Indiana’s participation in the MISO transmission service and wholesale
energy market, certain administrative fees and non-fuel costs have been incurred. IURC Orders have
been issued authorizing the deferral for consideration in a future rate case proceeding the
administrative fees and certain non-fuel related costs


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Electric Operations (continued)

incurred after Northern Indiana’s rate
moratorium, which expired on July 31, 2006. During 2007 non-fuel costs of
$3.4 million were deferred in accordance with the aforementioned orders. In addition,
administrative, FERC and other fees of $6.5 million were deferred. In total, for 2007 and 2006,
MISO costs of $9.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively, were deferred.

On April 25, 2006, the FERC issued an order on the MISO’s Transmission and Energy Markets Tariff,
stating that MISO had violated the tariff on several issues including not assessing revenue
sufficiency guarantee charges on virtual bids and offers and for charging revenue sufficiency
guarantee charges on imports. The FERC ordered MISO to perform a resettlement of these charges
back to the start of the Day 2 Market. The resettlement began on June 9, 2007 and ended in January
2008. Certain charge types included in the resettlement were originally considered to be non-fuel
and were recorded as regulatory assets, in accordance with previous IURC orders allowing deferral
of certain non-fuel MISO costs. During the fourth quarter 2007, based on precedent set by an IURC
ruling for another Indiana utility, Northern Indiana reclassified these charges, totaling $16.7
million, as fuel and included them in the fuel cost recovery mechanism in its latest FAC filing.

On September 14, 2007, MISO filed a tariff with FERC outlining the development of an ASM. The ASM
will allow participants to buy and sell operating reserves and regulation services that are
essential to reliability. The pricing of these markets will be optimized with the current energy
markets and MISO is targeting the start of the ASM for 2008. Northern Indiana is an active
stakeholder in the process used in designing, testing and implementing the ASM and in developing
the surrounding business practices. On January 18, 2008, Northern Indiana as part of a joint
petition to the IURC, filed a request to participate in ASM and seek approval of cost recovery
methodologies for associated costs. At this time, Northern Indiana is unable to determine what
impact the ASM will have on its operations or cash flows.

Cost Recovery and Trackers.

A significant portion of the Northern Indiana’s revenue is related to
the recovery of fuel costs to generate power and the fuel costs related to purchased power. These
costs are recovered through an FAC, a standard, quarterly, “summary” regulatory proceeding in
Indiana.

On January 30, 2008, the IURC approved a settlement agreement which was reached in October 2007
with the OUCC, LaPorte County and a group of Northern Indiana industrial customers to resolve
questions relating to the costs paid by customers for power purchased by Northern Indiana versus
the amount of these costs absorbed by Northern Indiana. The terms of the settlement call for
Northern Indiana to make a one-time payment to resolve this question as it relates to power
purchased from January 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007. The amount of the refund is set at
$33.5 million. A reserve for the entire amount was recorded in the third quarter of 2007.
Northern Indiana implemented a new “benchmarking standard” that will govern the allocation of costs
for purchased power between customers and Northern Indiana. The benchmark defines the price below
which customers will pay for power purchases and above which Northern Indiana must absorb a portion
of the costs. The benchmark is based upon the costs of power generated by a hypothetical natural
gas fired CCGT’s using gas purchased and delivered to Northern Indiana. This will most likely
result in Northern Indiana absorbing some purchased power costs that will reduce net revenues
during future periods. The agreement also contemplates Northern Indiana adding generating capacity
to its existing portfolio. The benchmark will be adjusted as new capacity is added. The added
generating capacity will substantially reduce the amount of purchased power and mitigate the impact
of the adjusted benchmark. Further, the settling parties agreed to support Northern Indiana’s
deferral and future recovery of carrying costs and depreciation associated with the acquisition of
new generating facilities. In the approving order, the IURC dictated that, while the parties
agreed to support the deferral of costs mentioned above, the IURC would rule on such deferral in
CPCN proceedings.

On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC for an ECT. Under the ECT,
Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended
by Northern Indiana to implement IDEM’s NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2)
related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities
become operational through an EERM. Under the IURC’s November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is
permitted to submit filings on a semi-annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the
EERM. In December 2006, Northern Indiana filed a petition with the IURC for appropriate cost
treatment and recovery of emission control construction needed to address the Phase I CAIR
requirements of the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board’s CAIR rules that became effective on
February 25, 2007.


ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Electric Operations (continued)

On July 3, 2007, Northern Indiana received an IURC order issuing a CPCN for the
CAIR and CAMR Phase I
Compliance Plan Projects, estimated to cost approximately $23 million. Northern Indiana will
include the CAIR and CAMR Phase I Compliance Plan costs to be recovered in the semi-annual and
annual ECRM and EERM filing six months after construction costs begin. On December 19, 2007, the
IURC approved Northern Indiana’s latest compliance plan with the estimate of $338.5 million. On
October 10, 2007, the IURC approved ECR-10 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated
depreciation) of $237.4 million. In February 2008, Northern Indiana filed ECR-11 for $252.6
million in capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) and EER-5 for $14.1 million in
expenses.

On January 9, 2008, the IURC established a procedural schedule to review the October 27, 2006 Joint
Petition of Indiana Gasification, LLC., Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana and Northern Indiana.
The petition seeks IURC approval for a coal gasification facility, the transportation of
electricity and SNG produced at the facilities and the recovery of the cost incurred by the joint
petitioners. A technical workshop and settlement hearing are scheduled for April 2008.

Mitchell Station.

In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station.
In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the
Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length
of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana, with input from a broad based
stakeholder group, is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell Station facility
in light of its value for alternative uses and the substantial cost of restarting the facility
including the expected increases in the level of environmental controls required. Northern Indiana
has received guidance from the IDEM that any reactivation of this facility would require a
preconstruction New Source Review Standards permit. The detailed analysis of alternative methods
to meet customers’ future power needs filed in the IRP did not recommend restarting the Mitchell
Station. Northern Indiana does not anticipate restarting the Mitchell Station in the near term.

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December
31, 2007, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to
Note 18-E, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment.

Restructuring

No amounts for restructuring were recorded in 2007 for Electric Operations. Electric Operations
recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with NiSource’s outsourcing
agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Electric
Operations restructuring liability at December 31, 2006 and 2007, was zero. Refer to Note 3,
“Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment.

Sales

Electric Operations sales were 17,813.1 gwh for the year 2007, an increase of 384.8 gwh compared to
2006, mainly resulting from increased residential and commercial sales due to warmer weather and
increased usage, increased wholesale volumes and customer growth.

Electric Operations sales were 17,428.3 gwh for the year 2006, a slight decrease of 58.7 gwh
compared to 2005, mainly resulting from decreased residential sales due to milder weather. This
decrease was partially offset by increased industrial volumes, particularly in the steel sector.

Net Revenues

Electric Operations net revenues were $811.6 million for 2007, a decrease of $10.8 million from
2006. This decrease was primarily a result of a $33.5 million settlement related to the cost of
power purchased by Northern Indiana in 2006 and 2007, a $10.9 million adjustment for estimated
unbilled electric revenues, lower industrial margins and usage of $11.8 million and higher revenue
credits of $5.1 million, due to the timing of the credits, and $3.2 million of non-recoverable
purchase power incurred in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of the settlement

Electric Operations (continued)

discussed above under, “Regulatory Matters.” Northern Indiana detected an error in its unbilled
revenue calculation and revised its estimate for unbilled electric and gas revenues in the fourth
quarter of 2007. Over a period of several years, Northern Indiana used incorrect customer usage
data to calculate its unbilled revenue. The unbilled revenue estimates were never billed to
customers and the error was corrected in the fourth quarter of 2007. These decreases in net
revenues were partially offset by higher wholesale margins and volumes of $19.6 million, favorable
weather of approximately $17 million, higher residential and commercial volumes attributable to
usage and increased customers of $15.3 million and lower unrecoverable MISO costs of $7.1 million.

Electric Operations net revenues were $822.4 million for 2006, an increase of $27.3 million from
2005, due to $13.5 million of lower unrecoverable MISO costs included in cost of sales, $10.7
million from proceeds received for emissions allowances, a reduction in customer credits of $7.7
million, due to the timing of the credits, increased environmental tracker revenues of $7.4 million
(offset in expense), an increase in residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately
$6 million and increased industrial volumes. The lower unrecoverable MISO costs resulted mainly
from the IURC’s ruling on the recoverability of certain MISO costs as well as the deferral of
certain costs for future recovery which began on August 1, 2006. These increases in net revenues
were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable weather compared to the 2005 year of
approximately $21 million.

Operating Income

Operating income for 2007 was $261.5 million, a decrease of $48.9 million from 2006. The decrease
in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $38.1 million and lower net revenues
described above. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher employee and administrative
expense of $29.0 million, higher electric generation expense of $9.6 million, higher storm damage
restoration costs amounting to $4.3 million and higher depreciation expense of $4.6 million,
partially offset by lower MISO administrative expenses of $3.0 million. The employee and
administrative costs include payroll, benefits and higher corporate services costs primarily
related to NiSource’s business services arrangement with IBM.

Operating income for 2006 was $310.4 million, an increase of $17.1 million from 2005. The increase
in operating income was due to the changes in net revenue mentioned above, partially offset by
higher operating expenses of $10.2 million. Operating expenses increased due to higher electric
generation and maintenance expense of $9.3 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of
approximately $3.3 million and $4.8 million in increased other taxes compared to the same period in
2005. The change in operation and maintenance expense was favorably impacted by transition costs,
a restructuring charge and a pension and other postretirement benefit charge totaling $8.4 million
associated with the IBM agreement made in the comparable 2005 period.

Whiting Clean Energy

. On December 18, 2006, Whiting Clean Energy and BP executed an amendment
which materially changed the terms of the ESA under which Whiting Clean Energy provides steam to
BP, including increasing the amount to be paid by BP for steam. The agreement specifies a planned
termination of the ESA at the end of 2009, with options for BP to extend the term one additional
year under renegotiated steam pricing. Whiting Clean Energy accrued $17.0 million in December
2006, which was reflected in operation and maintenance expense, for costs associated with contract
termination terms under the agreement. Additionally, BP would have the right of first refusal
regarding any offers for the sale of the Whiting Clean Energy facility at BP.

On July 27, 2007, Whiting Clean Energy submitted a proposal in response to the Northern
Indiana-issued RFP “2008 Combined Cycle Request for Proposals”. Whiting Clean Energy was notified
during October 2007 that its proposal to sell its facility was selected by Northern Indiana based
on a purchase price of $210 million. On December 22, 2007, BP indicated it would exercise a
contractual right of first refusal to purchase the Whiting Clean Energy facility. Whiting Clean
Energy is in discussions with BP regarding several aspects of the offer. The carrying amount of
the Whiting Clean Energy facility is approximately $270 million.

On December 31, 2007, Whiting Clean Energy redeemed $292.1 million of its notes due June 20, 2011,
having an average interest rate of 8.30%. The associated redemption premium of $40.6 million was
charged to loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt. The redemption was financed with
NiSource borrowings.

Lake Erie Land Company, Inc.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, which is wholly owned by NiSource, began accounting for the
operations of the Sand Creek Golf Club as discontinued operations. In June 2006, the assets of the
Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $11.9 million, and additional properties were sold to a private
real estate development group. An after-tax loss of $0.2 million was recorded in June 2006. As a
result of the June 2006 transaction, property estimated to be sold to the private developer during
the next twelve months has been recorded as assets held for sale.

NDC Douglas Properties

NDC Douglas Properties, a subsidiary of NiSource Development Company, is in the process of exiting
some of its low income housing investments. Two of these investments were disposed of during 2006
and one in 2007. Two other investments are expected to be sold or disposed of by the middle of
2008. NiSource has accounted for the investments to be sold as assets and liabilities of
discontinued operations. An impairment loss of $2.3 million was recorded in the second quarter of
2006, due to the current book value exceeding the estimated fair value of these investments.

Other Operations (continued)

Environmental Matters

Currently, various environmental matters impact the Other Operations segment. As of December 31,
2007, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note
18-E, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment.

Net Revenues

For the year ended 2007, net revenues were $65.8 million, an increase of $29.6 million from 2006.
The increase was a result of higher revenues from the Whiting Clean Energy facility of $30.5
million. As described previously, Whiting Clean Energy and BP signed a definitive agreement in
December 2006 redefining the terms under which Whiting Clean Energy provides steam to BP for its
oil refining process.

For the year ended 2006, net revenues were $36.2 million, a decrease of $5.9 million from 2005.
The decrease was mainly due to decreased revenues from the operation of the Whiting Clean Energy
facility partially offset by increased commercial and industrial gas marketing revenues of $2.1
million.

Operating Income or Loss

The Other Operations segment reported operating income of $8.1 million in 2007 compared to an
operating loss of $40.2 million for 2006 due to higher revenues associated with Whiting Clean
Energy described above, and the impact of contract termination costs with BP of $17.0 million
accrued in the fourth quarter of 2006.

The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $40.2 million in 2006, an increased loss
of $27.9 million from the 2005 period, due to increased losses associated with Whiting Clean
Energy, including contract termination costs with BP of $17.0 million accrued in the fourth quarter
of 2006 and increased scheduled maintenance costs of $7.2 million for Whiting Clean Energy,
partially offset by a reduction in uncollectible accounts of $4.0 million and $2.1 million of
increased revenues from commercial and industrial gas marketing.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of NiSource Inc.:

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements
of consolidated long-term debt of
NiSource Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related
consolidated statements of income, of common stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and of
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 8. The Company’s management
is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007
and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As explained in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, effective December 31, 2006, the
Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement No. 158, “Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated March 5, 2008, expressed an adverse opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting because of a material weakness.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of NiSource Inc:

We have audited NiSource Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company’s”) internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on that risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over
financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of
the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management’s
assessment: the Company’s internal controls were not effective
to ensure the proper calculation of its estimates of unbilled revenue at its
Northern Indiana subsidiary. This material weakness was
considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2007, of the Company and this report does not affect our report on such financial
statements and financial statement schedules.

In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness identified above on the achievement
of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management’s statement regarding its
comprehensive plan to strengthen Northern Indiana’s unbilled revenue estimating process, its
additional internal controls to verify the accuracy of the monthly calculation, or its plan for
remediation.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2007, of the Company and our report dated March 5, 2008
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules
and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s adoption of Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement No. 158.

ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

A. Company Structure and Principles of Consolidation.

NiSource, a Delaware corporation, is a
holding company whose subsidiaries provide natural gas, electricity and other products and services
to approximately 3.8 million customers located within a corridor that runs from the Gulf Coast
through the Midwest to New England. NiSource is a holding company under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 2005. NiSource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the
operating results of its 16 direct subsidiaries.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NiSource and its majority-owned
subsidiaries after the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. Investments for
which at least a 20% interest is owned, certain joint ventures and limited partnership interests of
more than 3% are accounted for under the equity method. Except where noted above and in the event
where NiSource has significant influence, investments with less than a 20% interest are accounted
for under the cost method. NiSource also consolidates variable interest entities for which
NiSource is the primary beneficiary.

B. Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

C. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash.

NiSource considers all investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. NiSource reports amounts deposited in
brokerage accounts for margin requirements as restricted cash. In addition, NiSource has amounts
deposited in trust to satisfy requirements for the provision of various property, liability,
workers compensation, and long-term disability insurance, which is classified as restricted cash
and disclosed as an investing cash flow on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.

Restricted cash was $59.4 million and $142.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was due primarily to the change in forward gas
prices which resulted in decreased margin deposits on open derivative contracts.

D. Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenue.

Accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets includes both billed and unbilled amounts as NiSource believes that total accounts
receivable is a more meaningful presentation, given the factors which impact both billed and
unbilled accounts receivable. Unbilled revenue is based on estimated amounts of electric energy or
natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its customers. Unbilled amounts of accounts receivable
relate to a portion of a customer’s consumption of gas or electricity from the date of the last
cycle billing date through the last day of the month (balance sheet date). Factors taken into
consideration when estimating unbilled revenue include historical usage, customer rates and
weather. Accounts receivable fluctuates from year to year depending upon seasonality and price
volatility. NiSource’s accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes unbilled
revenue, less reserves, in the amounts of $240.1 million and $250.2 million for the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Northern Indiana detected an error in its unbilled revenue calculation and revised its estimate for
unbilled electric and gas revenues in the fourth quarter of 2007. Over a period of several years,
Northern Indiana used incorrect customer usage data to calculate its unbilled revenue. As a
result, this correction reduced electric net revenues by $10.9 million and gas net revenues by
$14.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The unbilled revenue estimates were never billed to
customers.

E. Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.

NiSource’s investments in debt and equity securities
are carried at fair value and are designated as available-for-sale. These investments are included
within “Other investments” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, net of
deferred income taxes, are reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income. These investments
are monitored for other than temporary declines in market value. Realized gains and losses and
permanent impairments are reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Income.


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately $49 million of investments were pledged as collateral
for trust accounts related to NiSource’s wholly owned insurance company.

F. Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.

NiSource’s rate-regulated subsidiaries
follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. SFAS No. 71 provides that
rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the
economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are
designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and it is probable that such rates
can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate
determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are
recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or
refunded to customers.

In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its
costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the
criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write-down of all or a portion of
NiSource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery
was approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally
accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during
such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable
amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required
to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In management’s opinion, NiSource’s regulated
subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future.

With the adoption of SFAS No. 158 NiSource determined that for certain rate-regulated subsidiaries
the future recovery of pension and other postretirement plans costs is probable in accordance with
the requirements of SFAS No. 71. These rate-regulated subsidiaries recorded amounts that would
otherwise have been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income to a regulatory asset
account. Refer to Note 2, “Recent Accounting Pronouncements,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

Regulatory assets of approximately $1,172.9 million as of December 31, 2007 are not presently
included in rate base and consequently are not earning a return on investment. The regulatory
assets of approximately $858.5 million are covered by specific regulatory orders and are being
recovered as components of cost of service over a remaining life of up to 30 years.
Regulatory assets of approximately $314.4 million require specific rate action.

G. Utility Plant and Other Property and Related Depreciation and Maintenance.

Property, plant and
equipment (principally utility plant) are stated at cost. The rate-regulated subsidiaries record
depreciation using composite rates on a straight-line basis over the remaining service lives of the
electric, gas and common properties.

Northern Indiana’s common utility plant and associated accumulated depreciation and
amortization are allocated
between Gas Distribution Utility and Electric Utility Property, Plant and Equipment.

For rate-regulated companies, AFUDC is capitalized on all classes of property except organization,
land, autos, office equipment, tools and other general property purchases. The allowance is
applied to construction costs for that period of time between the date of the expenditure and the
date on which such project is completed and placed in service. The pre-tax rate for AFUDC was 5.6%
in 2007, 5.5% in 2006, and 2.5% in 2005. Short-term borrowings were primarily used to fund
construction efforts for all three years presented. The increase in the 2006 AFUDC rate, as
compared with 2005, was due to higher short-term interest rates and an increase in the level of
funding capital projects with long-term financing and equity.

The depreciation provisions for utility plant, as a percentage of the original cost, for the
periods ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:

The Whiting Clean Energy facility owned by PEI, a consolidated subsidiary of NiSource, is being
depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 40-year useful life.

Generally, NiSource’s subsidiaries follow the practice of charging maintenance and repairs,
including the cost of removal of minor items of property, to expense as incurred. When regulated
property that represents a retired unit is replaced or removed, the cost of such property is
credited to utility plant, and such cost, net of salvage, is charged to the accumulated provision
for depreciation.

H. Carrying Charges and Deferred Depreciation.

Upon completion of units 17 and 18 at the R. M.
Schahfer Generating Station, Northern Indiana capitalized the carrying charges and deferred
depreciation in accordance with orders of the IURC, pending the inclusion of the cost of each unit
in rates. Such carrying charges and deferred depreciation are being amortized over the remaining
service life of each unit.


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Northern Indiana has capitalized carrying charges and deferred depreciation and certain operating
expenses relating to its scrubber service agreement for its Bailly Generating Station in accordance
with an order of the IURC. The accumulated balance of the deferred costs and related carrying
charges is being amortized over the remaining life of the scrubber service agreement.

In the Columbia of Ohio 1999 rate agreement, the PUCO authorized Columbia of Ohio to revise its
depreciation accrual rates for the period January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2004. The revised
depreciation rates were lower than those which would have been utilized if Columbia of Ohio were
not subject to regulation and, accordingly, a regulatory asset had been established for the
difference.

In 2005, the PUCO authorized Columbia of Ohio to revise its depreciation accrual rates for the
period beginning January 1, 2005. The revised depreciation rates are now higher than those which
would have been utilized if Columbia of Ohio were not subject to regulation. Accordingly, the
accumulated regulatory asset balance of $131.7 million through December 31, 2004 has been reduced
in 2005 through 2007. The amount of depreciation that would have been recorded for 2005 through
2007 had Columbia of Ohio not been subject to rate regulation is a combined $104.3 million, a $17.8
million decrease over the $122.1 million reflected in rates. Consequently, the regulatory asset
was $113.9 million and $119.6 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

I. Amortization of Software Costs.

External and internal costs associated with computer software
developed for internal use are capitalized. Capitalization of such costs commences upon the
completion of the preliminary stage of each project in accordance with SOP 98-1. Once the
installed software is ready for its intended use, such capitalized costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis generally over a period of five years. NiSource amortized $22.6 million in
2007, $20.6 million in 2006 and $28.3 million in 2005 related to software costs. NiSource
unamortized software balance was $62.7 million at December 31, 2007.

J. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

NiSource has approximately $4.1 billion in goodwill and
other intangible assets. Substantially all goodwill relates to the excess of cost over the fair
value of the net assets acquired in the Columbia acquisition. In addition, NiSource has other
intangible assets consisting primarily of franchise rights apart from goodwill that were identified
as part of the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisitions of Bay State, Northern
Utilities, which is a subsidiary of Bay State, and Granite State Gas, all of which are wholly owned
subsidiaries of NiSource, which are being amortized over forty years from the date of acquisition.
NiSource accounts for goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142 and for other intangible assets
under SFAS No. 144. Refer to Note 5, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

K. Long-lived Assets.

NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets contains significant long-lived
assets other than goodwill and intangible assets discussed above which are not subject to recovery
under SFAS No. 71. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of
these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be
impaired as per SFAS No. 144. Refer to Note 3, “Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges,” in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

L. Revenue Recognition.

With the exception of amounts recognized for energy trading activities,
revenues are recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to
customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include
estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of
commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income
upon delivery of the commodities.

Revenues relating to energy trading operations are recorded based upon changes in the fair values,
net of reserves, of the related energy trading contracts. Changes in the fair values of energy
trading contracts are recognized in
revenues net of associated costs. Gains and losses relating to non-trading derivatives designated
as cash flow or fair value hedges are reported on a gross basis, upon settlement, in the same
income statement category as the related hedged item. Normal purchase or sale contracts are
reported on a gross basis upon settlement and recorded in the corresponding income statement
category based on commodity type.

M. Earnings Per Share.

Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders
by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The weighted
average shares outstanding for diluted EPS include the incremental effects of the various long-term
incentive compensation plans. There are no instruments that would result in an antidilutive effect
on the calculation of EPS.

The numerator in calculating both basic and diluted EPS for each year is reported net income. The
computation of diluted average common shares follows:

N. Estimated Rate Refunds.

Certain rate-regulated subsidiaries collect revenues subject to refund
pending final determination in rate proceedings. In connection with such revenues, estimated rate
refund liabilities are recorded which reflect management’s current judgment of the ultimate
outcomes of the proceedings. No provisions are made when, in the opinion of management, the facts
and circumstances preclude a reasonable estimate of the outcome.

O. Accounts Receivable Sales Program.

NiSource enters into agreements with third parties to sell
certain accounts receivable without recourse. These sales are reflected as reductions of accounts
receivable in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and as operating cash flows in the
accompanying Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. The costs of these programs, which are based
upon the purchasers’ level of investment and borrowing costs, are charged to Other, net in the
accompanying Statements of Consolidated Income.

P. Fuel Adjustment Clause.

All metered electric rates contain a provision for adjustment to
reflect increases and decreases in the cost of fuel and the fuel cost of purchased power through
operation of a fuel adjustment clause. As prescribed by order of the IURC applicable to metered
retail rates, the adjustment factor has been calculated based on the estimated cost of fuel and the
fuel cost of purchased power in a future three-month period. If two statutory requirements
relating to expense and return levels are satisfied, any under-recovery or over-recovery caused by
variances between estimated and actual costs in a given three-month period are recorded as
adjustments to revenue and will be included in a future filing, provided that the benchmark
established as part of the FAC-71 settlement has not been exceeded. Northern Indiana records any
under-recovery or over-recovery as a current regulatory asset or liability until such time as it is
billed or refunded to its customers. The fuel adjustment factor is subject to a quarterly review
by the IURC and remains in effect for a three-month period.

Q. Gas Cost Adjustment Clause.

All of NiSource’s Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries except
for Northern Indiana defer most differences between gas purchase costs and the recovery of such
costs in revenues, and adjust future billings for such deferrals on a basis consistent with
applicable state-approved tariff provisions. Northern Indiana adjusts its revenues for differences
between amounts collected from customers and actual gas costs and adjusts future billings for such
deferrals on a basis consistent with applicable state-approved tariff provisions.

R. Gas Inventory.

Both the LIFO inventory methodology and the weighted average methodology are
used to value natural gas in storage, as approved by state regulators for each of NiSource’s
regulated subsidiaries. Inventory valued using LIFO was $344.3 million and $471.5 million at
December 31, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Based on
the average cost of gas using the LIFO method, the estimated replacement cost of gas in storage at
December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, exceeded the stated LIFO cost by $481.0 million and $363.0
million, respectively. Inventory valued using the weighted average methodology was $113.9 million
at December 31, 2007 and $79.0 million at December 31, 2006.

S. Accounting for Exchange and Balancing Arrangements of Natural Gas.

NiSource’s Gas Transmission
and Storage and Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries enter into balancing and exchange
arrangements of natural gas as part of their operations and off-system sales programs. NiSource
records a receivable or payable for their respective cumulative gas imbalances and for any gas
borrowed or lent under an exchange agreement. These receivables and payables are recorded as
“Exchange gas receivable” or “Exchange gas payable” on NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, as
appropriate.

T. Accounting for Emissions Allowances.

Northern Indiana has obtained SO2 and NOx emissions
allowances from the EPA based upon its electric generation operations that the utility may sell,
trade or hold for future use. Northern Indiana utilizes the inventory model in accounting for
these emissions allowances, whereby these allowances were recognized at zero cost upon receipt from
the EPA. The utility defers proceeds from the sale of certain allowances as regulatory liabilities
to be applied for customer benefit. The sale of other allowances, not used due to investments made
by NiSource in pollution control assets and services, are reflected in earnings in the period in
which they occur and are included in net cash flows from operating activities in NiSource’s
Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.

U. Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities.

SFAS No. 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging
activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, unless such contracts are exempted as
a normal purchase normal sale under the provisions of the standard. The accounting for changes in
the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting
designation.

NiSource uses a variety of derivative instruments (exchange traded futures and options, physical
forwards and options, financial commodity swaps, and interest rate swaps) to effectively manage its
commodity price risk and interest rate risk exposure. If certain conditions are met, a derivative
may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a
recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to
variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. In order for a derivative contract to be
designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or
transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the
hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated.
Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recognized currently in earnings. For derivative
contracts that qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exemption under SFAS. No. 133, a
contract’s fair value is not recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements until the contract
is settled.

Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated
other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature
of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective
portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income and are
recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. If a forecasted
transaction corresponding to a cash flow hedge is no longer probable to occur, the accumulated
gains or losses on the derivative are recognized currently in earnings. For fair value hedges, the
gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of
the hedged item. As a result of the rate-making process, the rate-regulated subsidiaries generally
record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in
earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses
recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. When gains and
losses are recognized in earnings, they are recognized in cost of sales for derivatives that
correspond to commodity risk activities and are recognized in interest expense for derivatives that
correspond to interest-rate risk activities.

Energy trading activities refer to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating
profits on, or from exposure to, shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource’s trading activities
concluded in the third quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts
outstanding at that time. NiSource’s contracts related to trading operations in 2005 and in prior
periods were evaluated in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133.
Refer to Note 8, “Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information.


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

V. Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits.

NiSource records income taxes to recognize full
interperiod tax allocations. Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are provided for
the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to
future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of
existing assets and liabilities. Previously recorded investment tax credits of the regulated
subsidiaries were deferred on the balance sheet and are being amortized to book income over the
regulatory life of the related properties to conform to regulatory policy.

To the extent certain deferred income taxes of the regulated companies are recoverable or payable
through future rates, regulatory assets and liabilities have been established. Regulatory assets
for income taxes are primarily attributable to property related tax timing differences for which
deferred taxes had not been provided in the past, when regulators did not recognize such taxes as
costs in the rate-making process. Regulatory liabilities for income taxes are primarily
attributable to the regulated companies’ obligation to refund to ratepayers deferred income taxes
provided at rates higher than the current federal income tax rate. Such amounts are credited to
ratepayers using either the average rate assumption method or the reverse South Georgia method.

Pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code and relevant state taxing authorities, NiSource and its
subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns for federal and certain state jurisdictions.
NiSource and its subsidiaries are parties to an agreement (Tax Allocation Agreement) that provides
for the allocation of consolidated tax liabilities. The Tax Allocation Agreement generally
provides that each party is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be owed had the
party been separately subject to tax. Any net benefit attributable to the parent is reallocated to
other members.

W. Environmental Expenditures.

NiSource accrues for costs associated with environmental
remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs is probable and the amounts can be
reasonably estimated, regardless of when the expenditures are actually made. The undiscounted
estimated future expenditures are based on currently enacted laws and regulations, existing
technology and estimated site-specific costs where assumptions may be made about the nature and
extent of site contamination, the extent of cleanup efforts, costs of alternative cleanup methods
and other variables. The liability is adjusted as further information is discovered or
circumstances change. The reserves for estimated environmental expenditures are recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets in “Other accruals” for short-term portions of these liabilities and
“Other noncurrent liabilities” for the respective long-term portions of these liabilities.
Rate-regulated subsidiaries applying SFAS No. 71 establish regulatory assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets to the extent that future recovery of environmental remediation costs is probable
through the regulatory process.

In addition, Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC in 2003 to recover costs associated
with environmental compliance programs for NOx pollution-reduction equipment at Northern Indiana’s
generating stations. Refer to Note 7, “Regulatory Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information.

X. Excise Taxes.

NiSource accounts for excise taxes that are customer liabilities by separately
stating on its invoices the tax to its customers and recording amounts invoiced as liabilities
payable to the applicable taxing jurisdiction. NiSource accounts for these taxes in accordance
with EITF No. 06-3 whereby these types of taxes, comprised largely of sales taxes collected, are
presented on a net basis affecting neither revenues nor cost of sales. NiSource accounts for other
taxes for which it is liable by recording a liability for the expected tax with a corresponding
charge to “Other taxes” expense.

2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS No. 158 – Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158 to improve existing reporting for defined benefit
postretirement plans by requiring employers to recognize in the statement of financial position the
overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan, among other changes.

In the fourth quarter of 2006, NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158. Based on the
measurement of the various defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans’ assets and
benefit obligations at September 30, 2006, the pretax impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 decreased
intangible assets by $46.5 million, decreased deferred charges and other assets by $1.1 million,
increased regulatory assets by $538.8 million, increased accumulated other comprehensive income by
$239.8 million and increased accrued liabilities for postretirement and postemployment benefits by
$251.4 million. In addition, NiSource recorded a reduction in deferred income taxes of
approximately $96 million. With the adoption of SFAS No. 158 NiSource determined that for certain
rate-regulated subsidiaries the future recovery of pension and other postretirement plans costs is
probable in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 71. These rate-regulated subsidiaries
recorded regulatory assets and liabilities that would otherwise have been recorded to accumulated
other comprehensive income.

On January 1, 2007, NiSource adopted the SFAS No. 158 measurement date provisions requiring
employers to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the fiscal year-end. The pre-tax
impact of adopting the SFAS No. 158 measurement date provisions increased deferred charges and
other assets by $9.4 million, decreased regulatory assets by $89.6 million, decreased retained
earnings by $11.3 million, increased accumulated other comprehensive income by $5.3 million and
decreased accrued liabilities for postretirement and postemployment benefits by $74.2 million.
NiSource also recorded a reduction in deferred income taxes of approximately $2.6 million. In
addition, 2007 expense for pension and postretirement benefits reflects the updated measurement
date valuations. Refer to Note 11, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

FIN 48 – Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48 to
reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement
requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, this interpretation requires
that a tax position meet a “more-likely-than-not recognition threshold” for the benefit of an
uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements and requires that benefit to be
measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon
ultimate settlement. The determination of whether a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold is based on whether it is probable of being sustained on audit by the
appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. Additionally,
FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2006.

On January 1, 2007, NiSource adopted the provisions of FIN 48. As a result of the implementation
of FIN 48, NiSource recognized a charge of $0.8 million to the opening balance of retained
earnings. Refer to Note 10, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.

SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) – Share-Based Payment.

Effective January 1, 2006, NiSource adopted
SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method. SFAS No. 123R requires measurement
of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition
of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. In accordance with the
modified prospective transition method, NiSource’s consolidated financial statements for prior
periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS No. 123R. Prior
to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, NiSource applied the intrinsic value method of APB No. 25 for
awards granted under its stock-based compensation plans and complied with the disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 123.


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

When it adopted SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2006, NiSource recognized a cumulative effect
of change in accounting principle of $0.4 million, net of income taxes, which reflected the net
cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather
than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. Other than the requirement for
expensing stock options, outstanding share-based awards will continue to be accounted for
substantially as they are currently. Refer to Note 14, “Share-Based Compensation,” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS No. 157 – Fair Value Measurements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 to define
fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and to expand disclosures about fair
value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007
and should be applied prospectively, with limited exceptions. NiSource will adopt this standard
in the first quarter of 2008. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of this
interpretation and does not anticipate a material impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

SFAS No. 159 – The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Including an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 which permits
entities to choose to measure certain financial instruments at fair value that are not currently
required to be measured at fair value. Upon adoption, a cumulative adjustment will be made to
beginning retained earnings for the initial fair value option remeasurement. Subsequent unrealized
gains and losses for fair value option items will be reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and should not be applied
retrospectively, except as permitted for certain conditions for early adoption. NiSource is
currently reviewing the provisions of SFAS No. 159 to determine whether to elect fair value
measurement for any of its financial assets or liabilities when it adopts this standard in 2008.

SFAS No. 141R – Business Combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R to improve

3. Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges

Impairments.

PEI’s Whiting Clean Energy project at BP’s Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in
service in 2002. Because of continued losses from Whiting Clean Energy and the amended terms of
the agreement between Whiting Clean Energy and BP (discussed below), an impairment study was
performed during 2006. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 144, an impairment loss shall be
recognized only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its
fair value. The test compares the carrying amount of the long lived asset to the sum of the
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. The
study indicated that no impairment was necessary.

On July 27, 2007, Whiting Clean Energy submitted a proposal in response to the Northern
Indiana-issued RFP “2008 Combined Cycle Request for Proposals”. Whiting Clean Energy was notified
during October 2007 that its proposal to sell its facility was selected by Northern Indiana based
on a purchase price of $210 million. On December 22, 2007, BP indicated it would exercise a
contractual right of first refusal to purchase the Whiting Clean Energy facility. Whiting Clean
Energy is in discussions with BP regarding several aspects of the offer. The carrying amount of the
Whiting Clean Energy facility is approximately $270 million.

NiSource has recognized impairments for certain other assets. For 2007, NiSource recognized $11.0
million in expense for the impairment of assets, including a $7.2 million impairment charge related
to base gas at a storage field. For the 2006 year, $4.7 million was recognized for the impairment
of certain investments. In 2005, NiSource recognized a $10.9 million impairment for certain
obsolete software systems due to the outsourcing initiative with IBM.

Restructuring.

During the second quarter of 2005, NiSource Corporate Services reached a definitive
agreement with IBM under which IBM was to provide a broad range of business transformation and
outsourcing services to NiSource. The IBM Agreement is for ten years with a transition period that
ended on December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2007, 873 employees were terminated as a result of
the IBM Agreement, of whom 554 became employees of IBM.

On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM. Under the
amended agreement, NiSource will reassume responsibility for business support functions including
human resource administration, payroll, accounts payable, supply chain (procurement), sales
centers, and the majority of meter to cash operations (billing and collections). During 2007,
NiSource had already begun to bring certain finance and accounting functions back within the
company. These functions include general accounting, fixed asset accounting, and budgeting. In
the Customer Contact Centers, interim operational responsibility will be retained by IBM, although
NiSource intends to pursue a direct arrangement with Vertex, which currently operates the contact
center as a subcontractor for IBM. IBM will retain responsibility for information technology
operations. Support functions returning to NiSource will be transitioned in a phased approach
throughout 2008.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, NiSource announced a plan to reduce its executive ranks by
approximately 15% to 20% of the top-level executive group. As of December 31, 2007, 14 employees
were terminated as a result of the executive initiative, of which 2 employees were terminated
during 2007. In part, this reduction has come through anticipated attrition and consolidation of
basic positions.

In previous years, NiSource implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and
realize efficiencies as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. As of December 31, 2007, 1,567
employees were terminated, of which 1 employee was terminated during 2007. Of the $2.2 million
remaining restructuring liability from the Columbia merger and related initiatives, $2.0 million is
related to facility exit costs.

Other Charges.

NiSource incurred additional costs related to its Amended Outsourcing Agreement with
IBM. These costs fall into three categories; a one-time financial settlement charge, transition
costs to transfer certain functional areas to NiSource, and capital costs for completion of
information technology related transformation projects. A settlement charge of $9.8 million was
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007 to Operation and Maintenance expense on the Consolidated
Income Statement.

On December 18, 2006, Whiting Clean Energy and BP executed an amendment which materially changed
the terms of the ESA under which Whiting Clean Energy provides steam to BP. The agreement
specifies a planned termination of the ESA at the end of 2009, with options for BP to extend the
term one additional year under renegotiated steam pricing. Whiting Clean Energy accrued $17.0
million in December 2006, for costs associated with contract termination terms under the agreement.

Assets classified as discontinued operations or held for sale are no longer depreciated.

Columbia Gulf is in the process of selling a portion of its offshore facilities. On October 30,
2007, Columbia Gulf and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company executed a definitive purchase and sale
agreement to sell a portion of Columbia Gulf’s offshore assets. Closing of the transaction is
dependent upon the receipt of required regulatory approvals which NiSource anticipates receiving in
the first half of 2008. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company currently co-owns and utilizes the offshore
assets being sold. In the third quarter of 2007, these assets were classified as assets held for
sale.

NDC Douglas Properties, a subsidiary of NiSource Development Company, is in the process of exiting
some of its low income housing investments. Two of these investments were disposed of during 2006
and one in 2007. Two other investments are expected to be sold or disposed of by the middle of
2008. NiSource has accounted for the investments to be sold as assets and liabilities of
discontinued operations. An impairment loss of $2.3 million was recorded in the second quarter of
2006, due to the current book value exceeding the estimated fair value of these investments.

NiSource Corporate Services is in the process of selling its Marble Cliff facility. Impairment
losses of $3.2 million and $2.5 million were recognized in the first quarters of 2007 and 2006,
respectively, due to the current book value exceeding the estimated fair value of the facility.
NiSource has accounted for this facility as assets held for sale.

On October 9, 2007, NiSource Development Company sold the former headquarters of Northern Indiana
for net book value of $1.6 million. A loss of $27 thousand was recorded in October 2007. In the
third quarter of 2007, an impairment loss of $0.2 million was recorded, due to the current book
value exceeding the estimated sale price of the facility.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, which is wholly owned by NiSource, began accounting for the
operations of the Sand Creek Golf Club as discontinued operations. In June 2006, the assets of the
Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $11.9 million, and additional properties were sold to a private
real estate development group. An after-tax loss of $0.2 million was recorded in June 2006. As a
result of the June 2006 transaction, property estimated to be sold to the private developer during
the next twelve months has been recorded as assets held for sale.

Columbia Transmission is in the process of selling certain facilities that are non-core to the
operation of the pipeline system. In the second quarter, management decided to remove certain
facilities from this group. This resulted in a $3.0 million decrease to the balance of assets held
for sale. Northern Indiana is also in the process of selling a non-core facility. NiSource has
accounted for these facilities as assets held for sale.

Results from discontinued operations from NDC Douglas Properties low income housing investments,

included is a reduction in interest expense of $0.6 million, net of taxes, related to the
completion of a tax audit in the third quarter of 2007.

5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

NiSource’s goodwill assets at December 31, 2007 pertaining to the acquisition of Columbia on
November 1, 2000, were $3,658.5 million. The goodwill balances at December 31, 2007 for Northern
Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas were $13.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively.

In the quarters ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006, NiSource performed its annual impairment
test of goodwill associated with the purchases of Columbia, Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and
Kokomo Gas. The results of the June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006 impairment tests indicated that no
impairment charge was required. For the purpose of testing for impairment the goodwill recorded in
the acquisition of Columbia, the related subsidiaries were aggregated into two distinct reporting
units, one within the Gas Distribution Operations segment and one within the Gas Transmission and
Storage Operations segment. NiSource uses the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair
value of its reporting units for the purposes of this test.

NiSource’s Intangible assets, apart from goodwill, consist of franchise rights, which were
identified as part of the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisition in February of
1999 of Bay State, Northern Utilities, which is a subsidiary of Bay State, and Granite State Gas.
These amounts were $422.1 million and $435.7 million, net of amortization of $123.3 million and
$109.7 million, at December 31, 2007, and 2006, respectively, and are being amortized over forty
years from the date of acquisition. NiSource recorded amortization expense of $13.6 million in
2007, 2006 and 2005 related to its intangible assets.

6. Asset Retirement Obligations

NiSource has accounted for retirement obligations on its assets since January 1, 2003 with the
adoption of SFAS No. 143. In the fourth quarter 2005, NiSource adopted the provisions of FIN 47,
which broadened the scope of SFAS No. 143 to include contingent asset retirement obligations and it
also provided additional guidance for the measurement of the asset retirement liabilities. This
accounting standard and the related interpretation require entities to record the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the
liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying
amount of the

related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized
cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate-regulated subsidiaries
defer the difference between the amount recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount
collected in rates as required pursuant to SFAS No. 71 for those amounts it has collected in rates
or expects to collect in future rates.

Changes in NiSource’s liability for asset retirement obligations for the years 2007 and 2006 are

NiSource has recognized asset retirement obligations associated with various obligations including
costs to remove and dispose of certain construction materials located within many of NiSource’s
facilities, certain costs to retire pipeline, removal costs for certain underground storage tanks,
removal of certain pipelines known to contain PCB contamination, closure costs for certain sites
including ash ponds, solid waste management units and a landfill, obligation to return leased rail
cars to specified conditions and the removal costs of certain facilities and off-shore platforms,
as well as some other nominal asset retirement obligations. NiSource recognizes that there are
obligations to incur significant costs to retire wells associated with gas storage operations,
however, these assets are land assets with indeterminable lives. Additionally, NiSource has a
significant obligation associated with the decommissioning of its two hydro facilities located in
Indiana. However, these assets have an indeterminate life and no asset retirement obligation has
been recorded.

Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and
collected in the service rates of the rate-regulated subsidiaries are classified as regulatory
liabilities and other removal costs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, NiSource accrued $6.7 million of accretion, of which $0.9
million was expensed and $5.8 million was recorded as a regulatory asset. For the year ended
December 31, 2006, NiSource accrued $8.9 million of accretion, of which $1.1 million was expensed
and $7.8 million was recorded as a regulatory asset.

7. Regulatory Matters

Gas Distribution Operations Regulatory Matters

Significant Rate Developments.

On January 28, 2008, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate
case with the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, seeking an increase of approximately $60
million annually. On February 1, 2008, Columbia of Ohio filed its Notice of Intent to File An
Application For Increase in Rates. The Columbia of Ohio Application was filed on March 3, 2008,
requesting an increase in base rates in excess of $80 million.

At Bay State, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities approved a $5.9 million annual
increase in the company’s base rates, effective November 1, 2007, under the company’s
performance-based rate mechanism. On October 17, 2007, Bay State petitioned the Massachusetts
Department of Public Utilities to allow the company to collect an additional $7.5 million in annual
revenue related to usage reductions occurring since its last rate case. Bay State also requested
approval of a steel infrastructure tracker that would allow for recovery of ongoing infrastructure
replacement program investments. The Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities is scheduled to
hold hearings on this matter in the first quarter of 2008.

On August 29, 2007, the Kentucky Public Service Commission approved a stipulation and settlement,
authorizing Columbia of Kentucky to increase its base rates by $7.25 million annually.

On May 9, 2007, the IURC approved Northern Indiana’s petition to simplify rates, stabilize revenues
and provide for energy efficiency funding. The order adopts a new rate structure that enhances
Northern Indiana’s ability to increase revenues and provides incremental funding for an energy
efficiency program.

Cost Recovery and Trackers.

A significant portion of the distribution companies’ revenue is
related to the recovery of gas costs, the review and recovery of which occurs via standard
regulatory proceedings. All states require periodic review of actual gas procurement activity to
determine prudence and to permit the recovery of prudently incurred costs related to the supply of
gas for customers. NiSource distribution companies have historically been found prudent in the
procurement of gas supplies to serve customers.

Certain operating costs of the NiSource distribution companies are significant, recurring in
nature, and generally outside the control of the distribution companies. Some states allow the
recovery of such costs via cost tracking mechanisms. Such tracking mechanisms allow for
abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the distribution companies to implement charges and
recover appropriate costs. Tracking mechanisms allow for more timely recovery of such costs as
compared with more traditional cost recovery mechanisms. Examples of such mechanisms include gas
cost recovery adjustment mechanisms, tax riders, and bad debt recovery mechanisms. Gas
Distribution Operations revenue is increased by the implementation and recovery of costs via such
tracking mechanisms.

Comparability of Gas Distribution Operations line item operating results is impacted by these
regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt
expenses. Increases in the expenses that are the subject of trackers result in a corresponding
increase in net revenues and therefore have essentially no impact on total operating income
results.

Certain types of natural gas risers, which are owned by customers, on Columbia of Ohio’s
distribution system have been evaluated under a study required by the PUCO, and have been found
prone to leak natural gas under certain conditions. On February 1, 2007, Columbia of Ohio
announced plans to identify and replace these risers on its distribution system. As of December
31, 2007, Columbia of Ohio deferred $5.9 million of costs associated with the study and
identification of these natural gas risers as a regulatory asset and currently has budgeted
approximately $142 million for the cost to identify and replace the risers. On October 26, 2007,
Columbia of Ohio and the PUCO Staff filed a Joint Stipulation and Recommendation that provided for
Columbia of Ohio’s assumption of financial responsibility for the repair or replacement of
customer-owned service lines and the replacement of risers prone to leak. In addition, the
Stipulation provides for Columbia of Ohio to capitalize its investment in the service lines and
risers, as well as the establishment of a tracking mechanism that would provide for the recovery of
operating and maintenance costs related to Columbia of Ohio’s capitalized investment and its
expenses incurred in identifying risers prone to leak. On December 28, 2007, Columbia of Ohio
entered into a Stipulation with the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel and Ohio Partners for Affordable
Energy, addressing the issues of Columbia of Ohio’s authority to assume responsibility for repair
or replacement of hazardous customer owned service lines, the establishment of accounting authority
for costs related to such activities, and the establishment of a mechanism to recover such costs.
The parties have recommended approval of the Stipulation to the PUCO.

On December 28, 2007, Columbia of Ohio entered into a Stipulation with the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel
and PUCO Staff and other stakeholders resolving litigation concerning a pending Gas Cost Recovery
audit of Columbia of Ohio. The Stipulation calls for an accelerated pass back to customers of
$36.6 million that will occur from January 31, 2008 through January 31, 2009, generated through
off-system sales and capacity release programs, the development of new energy efficiency programs
for introduction in 2009, and the development of a wholesale auction process for customer supply to
take effect in 2010. The Stipulation also resolves issues related to pending and future Gas Cost
Recovery Management Performance audits through 2008. The PUCO approved this agreement on January
23, 2008.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations Regulatory Matters

Significant FERC Developments.

On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the “Order on Accounting for
Pipeline Assessment Costs.” This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application
across the industry for accounting for the costs of implementing the DOT’s Integrity Management
Rule. The effective date of the guidance was January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs have
been recorded as operating expenses. The rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in
periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded.

Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission are cooperating with the FERC on an informal, non-public
investigation of certain operating practices regarding tariff services offered by those companies.
Although the companies are continuing to cooperate with the FERC in an effort to reach a
consensual settlement, it is likely that any settlement will require the payment of fines or
refunds.

Millennium Pipeline Project.

Millennium received FERC approval for a pipeline project, in which
Columbia Transmission is participating, which will provide access to a number of supply and storage
basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The reconfigured project, which was approved by the FERC
in a certificate order issued December 21, 2006, will begin at an interconnect with Empire, an
existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New
York. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning,
New York. Millennium will extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin at Ramapo, New York.
The Millennium partnership is currently made up of the following companies: Columbia Transmission
(47.5%), DTE Millennium (26.25%), and KeySpan Millennium (26.25%). Columbia Transmission is the
operator.

The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related
pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, and Iroquois collectively referred to as the
“Companion Pipelines.” The December 21, 2006 certificate order also granted the necessary project
approvals to the Companion Pipelines. Construction began on June 22, 2007 with a projected
in-service date of November 1, 2008.

Hardy Storage Project.

Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary
applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received favorable orders on
November 1, 2005. On October 26, 2006, Hardy Storage filed an application seeking to amend the
November 1, 2005 order to revise the initial rates and estimated costs for the project pursuant to
executed settlement agreements with Hardy Storage’s customers. The certificate amendment was
approved by FERC on March 15, 2007.

Hardy Storage completed its third full quarter of operations, receiving customer injections into
its new underground natural gas storage facility in West Virginia. Injections this year will allow
the field to deliver up to 150,000 Dth of natural gas per day during the 2008-2009 winter heating
season. Customers withdrew over 900,000 Dth from the storage field during the last two months of
2007. When fully operational in 2009, the field will have a working storage capacity of 12 billion
cubic feet, delivering more than 176,000 Dth of natural gas per day. Hardy Storage is a joint
venture of subsidiaries of Columbia Transmission and Piedmont.

Eastern Market Expansion Project.

On May 3, 2007, Columbia Transmission filed a certificate
application before the FERC for approval to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and
transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities. This Eastern Market Expansion
project is projected to add 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation capacity and is fully
subscribed on a 15-year contracted firm basis. On January 14, 2008, the FERC issued a favorable
order which granted a certificate to construct the project and the project is expected to be in
service by spring 2009.

Electric Operations Regulatory Matters

Significant Rate Developments.

To settle a proceeding regarding Northern Indiana’s request to
recover intermediate dispatchable power costs, Northern Indiana has agreed to file an electric base
rate case on or before July 1, 2008.


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate
review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement.
The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will
receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year. The credits will continue at
approximately the same annual level and per the same methodology, until the IURC enters a base rate
order that approves revised Northern Indiana electric rates. The order included a rate moratorium
that expired on July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a
specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated
based on electric usage; therefore, in times of high usage the credit may be more than $55.1
million. Credits amounting to $56.0 million, $50.9 million and $58.5 million were recognized for
electric customers for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

MISO.

As part of Northern Indiana’s participation in the MISO transmission service and wholesale
energy market, certain administrative fees and non-fuel costs have been incurred. IURC Orders have
been issued authorizing the deferral for consideration in a future rate case proceeding the
administrative fees and certain non-fuel related costs incurred after Northern Indiana’s rate
moratorium, which expired on July 31, 2006. During 2007 non-fuel costs of $3.4 million were
deferred in accordance with the aforementioned orders. In addition, administrative, FERC and
other fees of $6.5 million were deferred. In total, for 2007 and 2006, MISO costs of $9.9 million
and $4.0 million, respectively, were deferred.

On April 25, 2006, the FERC issued an order on the MISO’s Transmission and Energy Markets Tariff,
stating that MISO had violated the tariff on several issues including not assessing revenue
sufficiency guarantee charges on virtual bids and offers and for charging revenue sufficiency
guarantee charges on imports. The FERC ordered MISO to perform a resettlement of these charges
back to the start of the Day 2 Market. The resettlement began on June 9, 2007 and ended in January
2008. Certain charge types included in the resettlement were originally considered to be non-fuel
and were recorded as regulatory assets, in accordance with previous IURC orders allowing deferral
of certain non-fuel MISO costs. During the fourth quarter 2007, based on precedent set by an IURC
ruling for another Indiana utility, Northern Indiana reclassified these charges, totaling $16.7
million, as fuel and included them in the fuel cost recovery mechanism in its latest FAC filing.

On September 14, 2007, MISO filed a tariff with FERC outlining the development of an ASM. The ASM
will allow participants to buy and sell operating reserves and regulation services that are
essential to reliability. The pricing of these markets will be optimized with the current energy
markets and MISO is targeting the start of the ASM for 2008. Northern Indiana is an active
stakeholder in the process used in designing, testing and implementing the ASM and in developing
the surrounding business practices. On January 18, 2008, Northern Indiana as part of a joint
petition to the IURC, filed a request to participate in ASM and seek approval of cost recovery
methodologies for associated costs. At this time, Northern Indiana is unable to determine what
impact the ASM will have on its operations or cash flows.

Cost Recovery and Trackers.

A significant portion of the Northern Indiana’s revenue is related to
the recovery of fuel costs to generate power and the fuel costs related to purchased power. These
costs are recovered through an FAC, a standard, quarterly, “summary” regulatory proceeding in
Indiana.

On January 30, 2008, the IURC approved a settlement agreement which was reached in October 2007
with the OUCC, LaPorte County and a group of Northern Indiana industrial customers to resolve
questions relating to the costs paid by customers for power purchased by Northern Indiana versus
the amount of these costs absorbed by Northern Indiana. The terms of the settlement call for
Northern Indiana to make a one-time payment to resolve this question as it relates to power
purchased from January 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007. The amount of the refund is set at
$33.5 million. A reserve for the entire amount was recorded in the third quarter of 2007.
Northern Indiana implemented a new “benchmarking standard” that will govern the allocation of costs
for purchased power between customers and Northern Indiana. The benchmark defines the price below
which customers will pay for power purchases and above which Northern Indiana must absorb a portion
of the costs. The benchmark is based upon the costs of power generated by a hypothetical natural
gas fired CCGT’s using gas purchased and delivered to Northern Indiana. This will most likely
result in Northern Indiana absorbing some purchased power costs that will reduce net revenues
during future periods. The agreement also contemplates Northern Indiana adding generating capacity
to its existing portfolio. The benchmark will be adjusted as new capacity is added. The added
generating capacity will substantially reduce the amount of purchased power and mitigate the impact
of the adjusted

benchmark. Further, the settling parties agreed to support Northern Indiana’s
deferral and future recovery of carrying costs and depreciation associated with the acquisition of
new generating facilities. In the approving order, the IURC dictated that, while the parties
agreed to support the deferral of costs mentioned above, the IURC would rule on such deferral in
CPCN proceedings.

On November 1, 2007, Northern Indiana filed its bi-annual IRP with the IURC. The plan showed the
need to add approximately 1,000 mw of new capacity. Additionally, during November 2007, Northern
Indiana filed a CPCN as well as contracts to purchase power generated with renewable energy,
specifically with wind. The CPCN requested approval to purchase two CCGT power plants — the
Whiting Clean Energy facility owned by PEI, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, and the Sugar
Creek facility located in west central Indiana and owned by LS Power Group. On December 22, 2007,
BP indicated it would exercise a contractual right of first refusal to purchase the Whiting Clean
Energy facility. Whiting Clean Energy is in discussions with BP regarding several aspects of the
offer. As a result, on January 25, 2008, Northern Indiana filed an amended CPCN to address just
the Sugar Creek CCGT facility. The estimated cost of the facility is $329 million. Northern
Indiana is requesting the IURC and the FERC to approve the purchase by the second quarter of 2008.

On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC for an ECT. Under the ECT,
Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended
by Northern Indiana to implement IDEM’s NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2)
related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities
become operational through an EERM. Under the IURC’s November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is
permitted to submit filings on a semi-annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the
EERM. In December 2006, Northern Indiana filed a petition with the IURC for appropriate cost
treatment and recovery of emission control construction needed to address the Phase I CAIR
requirements of the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board’s CAIR rules that became effective on
February 25, 2007. On July 3, 2007, Northern Indiana received an IURC order issuing a CPCN for the
CAIR and CAMR Phase I Compliance Plan Projects, estimated to cost approximately $23 million.
Northern Indiana will include the CAIR and CAMR Phase I Compliance Plan costs to be recovered in
the semi-annual and annual ECRM and EERM filing six months after construction costs begin. On
December 19, 2007, the IURC approved Northern Indiana’s latest compliance plan with the estimate of
$338.5 million. On October 10, 2007, the IURC approved ECR-10 for capital expenditures (net of
accumulated depreciation) of $237.4 million. In February 2008, Northern Indiana filed ECR-11 for
$252.6 million in capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) and EER-5 for $14.1
million in expenses.

On January 9, 2008, the IURC established a procedural schedule to review the October 27, 2006 Joint
Petition of Indiana Gasification, LLC., Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana and Northern Indiana.
The petition seeks IURC approval for a coal gasification facility, the transportation of
electricity and SNG produced at the facilities and the recovery of the cost incurred by the joint
petitioners. A technical workshop and settlement hearing are scheduled for April 2008.

Mitchell Station.

In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station.
In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the
Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length
of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana, with input from a broad based
stakeholder group, is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell Station facility
in light of its value for alternative uses and the substantial cost of restarting the facility
including the expected increases in the level of environmental controls required. Northern Indiana
has received guidance from the IDEM that any reactivation of this facility would require a
preconstruction New Source Review Standards permit. The detailed analysis of alternative methods
to meet customers’ future power needs filed in the IRP did not recommend restarting the Mitchell
Station. Northern Indiana does not anticipate restarting the Mitchell Station in the near term.

8. Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities

NiSource uses commodity-based derivative financial instruments primarily to manage commodity price
risk and interest rate risk exposure in its business as well as for commercial and industrial
sales. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. NiSource accounts for its
derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133. Under


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

SFAS No. 133, if certain conditions are met, a
derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair
value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the
exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. Additionally, certain NiSource
subsidiaries enter into forward physical contracts with various third parties to procure natural
gas or power for its operational needs. These forward physical contracts are derivatives which
qualify for the normal purchase normal sales exception under SFAS No. 133 and do not require
mark-to-market accounting.

components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as a regulatory asset or
liability per SFAS No. 71 as appropriate. During 2007 and 2006, NiSource reclassified no amounts
related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings,

due to the
probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur. It is anticipated that during
the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in
income statement recognition
of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately $23.5
million of income, net of taxes.

Commodity Price Risk Programs.

Northern Indiana, Northern Indiana Fuel and Light, Kokomo Gas,
Northern Utilities, Columbia of Pennsylvania, Columbia of Kentucky, Columbia of Maryland and
Columbia of Virginia use NYMEX derivative contracts to minimize risk associated with gas price
volatility. These derivative hedging programs must be marked to fair value, but because these
derivatives are used within the framework of the companies gas cost recovery mechanism, regulatory
assets or liabilities are recorded to offset the change in the fair value of these derivatives.

Northern Indiana offers a PPS as an alternative to the standard gas cost recovery mechanism. This
service provides Northern Indiana customers with the opportunity to either lock in the companies
gas cost or place a cap on the total cost that could be charged for any future month specified. In
order to hedge the anticipated physical purchases associated with these obligations, Northern
Indiana has purchased NYMEX futures, NYMEX options and basis contracts that correspond to a fixed
or capped price in the associated delivery month and currently enters into forward physical
contracts to secure forward gas prices. Columbia of Virginia started a program in April 2005
similar to the Northern Indiana PPS, which allows non-jurisdictional customers the opportunity to
lock in the companies gas cost. The NYMEX futures and option contracts associated with these
programs are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Northern Indiana also offers a DependaBill program to its customers as an alternative to the
standard tariff rate that is charged to residential customers. The program allows Northern Indiana
customers to fix their total monthly bill at a flat rate regardless of gas usage or commodity cost.
In order to hedge the anticipated physical purchases associated with these obligations, Northern
Indiana has purchased NYMEX futures, NYMEX options and basis contracts that match the anticipated
delivery needs of the program and currently enters into forward physical contracts to secure
forward gas prices. The NYMEX futures and options contracts associated with this program are
generally designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges.

As part of the MISO Day 2 initiative, Northern Indiana was allocated and has purchased FTRs. These
rights help Northern Indiana offset congestion costs due to the MISO Day 2 activity. The FTRs do
not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, but since congestion costs are recoverable through the
fuel cost recovery mechanism, the related gains and losses associated with these transactions are
recorded as a regulatory asset or liability, in accordance with SFAS No. 71. Additionally,
Northern Indiana also uses derivative contracts to minimize risk associated with power price
volatility. These derivative programs must be marked to fair value, but because these derivatives
are used within the framework of their cost recovery mechanism, regulatory assets or liabilities
are recorded to offset the change in the fair value of these derivatives.

For regulatory incentive purposes, Northern Indiana enters into gas purchase contracts at first of
the month prices that give counterparties the daily option to either sell an additional package of
gas at first of the month prices or recall the original volume to be delivered. Northern Indiana
charges a fee for this option. The changes in the fair value of these options are primarily due to
the changing expectations of the future intra-month volatility of gas prices. These written
options are derivative instruments, must be marked to fair value and do not meet the requirement
for hedge accounting treatment. However, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, Northern Indiana records
the related gains and losses associated with these transactions as a regulatory asset or liability.

For regulatory incentive purposes, Columbia of Kentucky, Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of
Pennsylvania, and Columbia of Maryland (collectively, the “Columbia LDCs”) enter into contracts
that allow counterparties the option to sell gas to Columbia LDCs at first of the month prices for
a particular month of delivery. Columbia LDCs charge the counterparties a fee for this option.
The changes in the fair value of the options are primarily due to the changing expectations of the
future intra-month volatility of gas prices. These Columbia LDCs defer a portion of the change in
the fair value of the options as either a regulatory asset or liability in accordance with SFAS No.
71 based on the regulatory customer sharing mechanisms in place, with the remaining changes in fair
value recognized currently in earnings.

Columbia Energy Services has fixed price gas delivery commitments to three municipalities in the
United States that expire during 2008. Columbia Energy Services entered into a forward purchase
agreement with a gas supplier, wherein the supplier will fulfill the delivery obligation
requirements at a slight premium to index. In order to hedge this anticipated future purchase of
gas from the gas supplier, Columbia Energy Services entered into commodity swaps priced at the
locations designated for physical delivery. These commodity swap derivatives are accounted for as
cash flow hedges.

Interest Rate Risk Activities.

Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes
issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate
swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5
million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying
debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88%, respectively.

NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics
of its outstanding long-term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance
entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million
with six counterparties having a 6 1/2-year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based
upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6-month BBA
LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of
the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009.

On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in
a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11-year term. NiSource Finance
will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount
based on U.S. 6-month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of
premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the
swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013.

As a result of the fixed-to-variable interest rate swap transactions referenced above, $1,160
million of NiSource Finance’s existing long-term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest
rates. These interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges. The effectiveness of the
interest rate swaps in offsetting the exposure to changes in the debt’s fair value is measured
pursuant to SFAS No. 133. NiSource had no net gain or loss recognized in earnings due to hedging
ineffectiveness from prior years.

9. Variable Interest Entities and Equity Investments

A. Variable Interest Entities.

On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R which required a
variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority
of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity’s activities or is entitled to receive a
majority of the entity’s residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity
is the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a
corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that
either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do
not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also
requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to
consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2004, NiSource has consolidated certain low income housing real
estate investments per FIN 46R, from which NiSource derives certain tax benefits for its
investment. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, NiSource increased its long-term debt by
approximately $13.0 million and $13.4 million, respectively, as a result of consolidating these
investments. However, this debt is nonrecourse to NiSource and NiSource’s direct and indirect
subsidiaries.

B. Equity Investments.

Certain investments of NiSource are accounted for under the equity method
of accounting. Income and losses from Millennium and Hardy Storage are reflected in Equity
Earnings (Loss) in Unconsolidated Affiliates on NiSource’s Statements of Consolidated Income.
These investments are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Income
and losses from all other equity investments are reflected in Other, net (below Operating Income)
on NiSource’s Statements of Consolidated Income. All investments shown as limited partnerships are
limited partnership interests.

The effective income tax rates were 35.6%, 35.3%, and 34.5% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The 0.3% increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2007 versus 2006 is due to increased state
income tax expense, offset by higher Section 199 deductions, lower regulatory flow-through
depreciation, and the capitalization of the tax impact of AFUDC-Equity to a regulatory asset. The
overall effective tax rate increase in 2006 versus 2005 was due to favorable state and federal
income tax adjustments recorded in 2005 and a reduction in the electric production deduction and
low income housing credits from those recorded in 2005. The increase was partially offset by a
lower effective state income tax rate in 2006 due to a reduction in deferred state income tax
liabilities.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, signed into law on October 22, 2004, created new Internal
Revenue Code Section 199 which, beginning in 2005, permits taxpayers to claim a deduction from
taxable income attributable to certain domestic production activities. Northern Indiana and
Whiting Clean Energy’s electric production activities qualify for this deduction. The deduction is
equal to 6% of QPAI for the taxable year, with certain limitations. This deduction was 3% of QPAI
for years 2005 and 2006 and increases to 9% of QPAI beginning in 2010 and thereafter.
The tax benefit for the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction claimed in NiSource’s
2006 consolidated federal income tax return was $1.5 million and is estimated to be $2.7 million
for 2007.

Included under Other, net in the table above, are state income tax net operating loss benefits of
$13.2 million and $14.2 million, as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. This tax loss
carryforward expires after tax year 2009. NiSource anticipates it will ultimately realize $2.8
million and $3.8 million of these benefits as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006,
respectively, prior to their expiration. As such, a valuation allowance of $10.4 million and $10.4
million, as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively, has been recorded.

On January 1, 2007, NiSource adopted the provisions of FIN 48. As a result of the implementation
of FIN 48, NiSource recognized a charge of $0.9 million to the opening balance of retained
earnings, which includes the adjustment to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits shown below.
The total amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was
$16.0 million, which was included in “Other noncurrent liabilities,” on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, NiSource recognized the following

As of
December 31, 2007, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a reduction of $12.3 million in the
liability for unrecognized tax benefits from the January 1, 2007 amount. The liability was reduced
by $1.6 million primarily to reflect negotiations associated with the 1999-2002 Tax Court petition
and by $7.5 million as discussed in Note 4, “Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities
Held for Sale.” In addition, NiSource reclassified $3.5 million of its liability for unrecognized
tax benefits to Taxes Accrued to reflect settlement of the Tax Court petition and the completion of
the 2003-2004 IRS audit. Additional accruals for current year issues increased the liability by
$0.8 million, while the lapse in the statute of limitations resulted in a $0.5 million decrease.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2007 that, if recognized, would
affect the effective tax rate is $3.7 million. NiSource does not anticipate any significant
changes to its liability for unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months.

Effective January 1, 2007, NiSource recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. In prior years, NiSource recognized such accrued
interest in interest expense and penalties in other expenses. During the years ended December 31,
2006, and December 31, 2005, NiSource recognized approximately $1.3 million and $0.8 million,
respectively, of interest in the Statements of Consolidated Income. NiSource also had $3.5 million
and $2.2 million accrued on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the payment of interest
at December 31, 2006, and December 31, 2005. No amounts have been estimated or accrued for
penalties. Upon adoption of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007, NiSource decreased its accrual for
interest on unrecognized tax benefits to $3.3 million, resulting in a $0.1 million, net of tax,
increase to the opening balance of retained earnings. As of December 31, 2007, there is $0.4
million of interest related to unrecognized tax benefits recorded on the balance sheet. During
2007, NiSource recorded $0.3 million of interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits as a
component of tax expense on the income statement, while $0.9 million was paid as a result of
settlements with federal and state taxing authorities and $2.3 million of accrued interest was
reversed through discontinued operations as discussed in Note 4. No amounts have been estimated or
accrued for penalties.

NiSource is subject to income taxation in the United States and various state jurisdictions,
primarily Indiana, West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Maine, Louisiana, Mississippi, Maryland, Illinois, Tennessee, New Jersey and New York.

Because NiSource is part of the IRS’s Large and Mid-Size Business program, each year’s federal
income tax return is typically audited by the IRS. Tax years through 2002 have been audited and
are settled and closed to further assessment. The two issues from our 1999 and 2000 tax years,
that had been petitioned to the Tax Court and subsequently settled with the IRS, received approval
of the Tax Court in the third quarter of 2007. The audit of tax years 2003 and 2004 was concluded
in the third quarter of 2007 with all issues being agreed to between the IRS and NiSource. The
audit of tax years 2005 and 2006 is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2008.

The statute of limitations in each of the state jurisdictions in which NiSource operates remain
open until the years are settled for federal income tax purposes, at which time amended state
income tax returns reflecting all federal income tax adjustments are filed. There are no state
income tax audits currently in progress.

11. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

NiSource provides defined contribution plans and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans
that cover its employees. Benefits under the defined benefit retirement plans reflect the
employees’ compensation, years of service and age at retirement. Additionally, NiSource provides
health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. The majority of employees
may become eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement age while working for NiSource.
The expected cost of such benefits is accrued during the employees’ years of service. Current
rates of rate-regulated companies include postretirement benefit costs, including amortization of
the regulatory assets that arose prior to inclusion of these costs in rates. For most plans, cash
contributions are remitted to grantor trusts.

Adoption of SFAS No. 158 — Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158 to improve existing
reporting for defined benefit postretirement plans by requiring employers to recognize in the
statement of financial position the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit
postretirement plan, among other changes.

In the fourth quarter of 2006, NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158. Based on the
measurement of the various defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans’ assets and
benefit obligations at September 30, 2006, the pretax impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 decreased
intangible assets by $46.5 million, decreased deferred charges and other assets by $1.1 million,
increased regulatory assets by $538.8 million, increased accumulated other comprehensive income by
$239.8 million and increased accrued liabilities for postretirement and postemployment benefits by
$251.4 million. In addition, NiSource recorded a reduction in deferred income taxes of
approximately $96 million. With the adoption of SFAS No. 158 NiSource determined that for certain
rate-regulated subsidiaries the future recovery of pension and other postretirement plans costs is
probable in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 71. These rate-regulated subsidiaries
recorded regulatory assets and liabilities that would otherwise have been recorded to accumulated
other comprehensive income.

On January 1, 2007, NiSource adopted the SFAS No. 158 measurement date provisions requiring
employers to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the fiscal year-end. The pre-tax
impact of adopting the SFAS No. 158 measurement date provisions increased deferred charges and
other assets by $9.4 million, decreased regulatory assets by $89.6 million, decreased retained
earnings by $11.3 million, increased accumulated other comprehensive income by $5.3 million and
decreased accrued liabilities for postretirement and postemployment benefits by $74.2 million.
NiSource also recorded a reduction in deferred income taxes of approximately $2.6 million. In
addition, 2007 expense for pension and postretirement benefits reflects the updated measurement
date valuations.

NiSource Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans’ Asset Management

.

NiSource employs a
total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to
maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. Risk tolerance is
established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and asset class
volatility. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income
investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as
well as growth, value, small and large capitalizations. Other assets such as private equity and
hedge funds are used judiciously to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio
diversification. Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely
manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of
the underlying assets. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and
periodic asset/liability studies.

NiSource utilizes a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and
rebalancing in determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are
studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are analyzed to
ensure that they are consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with
higher volatility generate greater return over the long run. Current market factors such as
inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are
determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and
appropriateness.

The categorization of investments into the asset classes in the table above are based on
definitions established by the NiSource Retirement and Investment Committee. Alternative
investments consist primarily of private equity and hedge fund investments. As of December 31,
2007, approximately $356 million of defined benefit pension assets included in international
equities or fixed income asset classes in the table above would be considered alternative
investments, as that term is defined by the AICPA, in addition to those investments in the
alternative investments asset class. Alternative investments are defined in the AICPA practice aid
on audit considerations for alternative investments as investments not listed on national exchanges
or over-the-counter markets, or for which quoted market prices are not available from sources such
as financial publications, the exchanges or NASDAQ.

NiSource determined that for certain rate-regulated subsidiaries the future recovery of pension and other postretirement benefits costs is
probable in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 71. These rate-regulated subsidiaries recorded regulatory assets and
liabilities of $301.7 million and $36.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2007 and regulatory assets of $538.8 million as of
December 31, 2006 that would otherwise have been recorded to accummulated other comprehensive income.

NiSource’s accumulated benefit obligation for its pension plans was $2,080.6 million and $2,167.0
million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation as of
a date is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to
employee service rendered prior to that date and based

on current and past compensation levels. The accumulated benefit obligation differs from the

NiSource recognized income of $4.4 million for its pension plans in 2007 compared to expense of
$16.9 million in 2006 due in large part to NiSource pension fund assets earning a return of 13.8%
for the plan year ended December 31, 2006. NiSource pension fund assets earned 10.5% for the plan year ended December 31, 2007.
For its other postretirement benefit plans, NiSource recognized $46.9 million in expense compared
to $46.1 million in 2006.

NiSource’s funded status for its pension plans improved to being overfunded at December 31, 2007 by
$79.4 million compared to being underfunded at December 31, 2006 by $233.4 million. The
improvement in funded status was due primarily to the increase in discount rate from the prior
measurement date, plan funding by NiSource of $66.3 million in 2007 and the favorable returns on
plan asset in 2007. NiSource’s funded status for its other

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

postretirement benefit plans improved by $59.5 million to an unfunded status of $455.7 million due
primarily to the increase in discount rate from the prior measurement date.

12. Authorized Classes of Cumulative Preferred and Preference Stocks

NiSource has 20,000,000 authorized shares of Preferred with a $0.01 par value, of which 4,000,000
shares are designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares.

On April 14, 2006, Northern Indiana redeemed all of its outstanding cumulative preferred stock,
having a total redemption value of $81.6 million.

The authorized classes of par value and no par value cumulative preferred and preference stocks of
Northern Indiana are as follows: 2,400,000 shares of Cumulative Preferred with a $100 par value;
3,000,000 shares of Cumulative Preferred with no par value; 2,000,000 shares of Cumulative
Preference with a $50 par value; and 3,000,000 shares of Cumulative Preference with no par value.

13. Common Stock

As of December 31, 2007, NiSource had 400,000,000 authorized shares of common stock with a $0.01
par value.

A. Shareholder Rights Plan.

NiSource had a Shareholder Rights Plan, pursuant to which one right
accompanies each share of common stock. Each right, when exercisable, would initially entitle the
holder to purchase from NiSource one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, with $0.01 par value, at a price of $60 per one one-hundredth of a share. In
certain circumstances, if an acquirer obtained 25% of NiSource’s outstanding shares, or merged into
NiSource or merged NiSource into the acquirer, the rights would entitle the holders to purchase
NiSource’s or the acquirer’s common shares for one-half of the market price.

On November 28, 2006, the NiSource Board adopted and approved the First Amendment to the
Shareholder Rights Plan, dated November 1, 2000, which requires that a holder of a Right
Certificate must exercise their rights by November 29, 2006. As a result of this amendment, no
rights are eligible to be exercised after November 29, 2006.

B. Common Stock Dividend.

Holders of shares of NiSource’s common stock are entitled to receive
dividends when, and if declared by the Board out of funds legally available. The policy of the
Board has been to declare cash dividends on a quarterly basis payable on or about the 20th day of
February, May, August and November. NiSource has paid quarterly common dividends totaling $0.92
per share for the 2007, 2006 and 2005 years. By unanimous written consent dated January 4, 2008,
the Board declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.23 per share, payable on February 20, 2008 to
holders of record on January 31, 2008.

14. Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, NiSource adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition
method. SFAS No. 123R requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair
value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards
expected to vest. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, NiSource’s
Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not
include, the impact of SFAS No. 123R. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, NiSource applied the
intrinsic value method of APB No. 25 for awards granted under its stock-based compensation plans
and complied with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123.

NiSource currently issues long-term incentive grants to key management employees under a long-term
incentive plan approved by stockholders on April 13, 1994 (1994 Plan). The 1994 Plan, as amended
and restated, permits the following types of grants, separately or in combination: nonqualified
stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights,
performance units, contingent stock awards and dividend equivalents payable on grants of options,
performance units and contingent stock awards. Under the plan, each

option has a maximum term of ten years from the date of grant. NiSource has traditionally awarded
stock options to employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of
grant. For stock options granted during January 2005, NiSource awarded stock options that vested
immediately, but included a one-year exercise restriction. Stock appreciation rights may be
granted only in tandem with stock options on a one-for-one basis and are payable in cash, common
stock, or a combination thereof.

At the annual meeting of stockholders held on May 10, 2005, NiSource’s stockholders approved
proposed amendments to the 1994 Plan. The amendments (i) increased the maximum number of shares of
NiSource common stock that may be subject to awards from 21 million to 43 million and (ii) extended
the period during which awards could be granted to May 10, 2015 and extended the term of the plan
until all the awards have been satisfied by either issuance of stock or the payment of cash. At
December 31, 2007, there were 26,215,789 shares reserved for future awards under the amended and
restated 1994 Plan.

NiSource recognized stock-based employee compensation expense of $4.4 million and $6.9 million
during the years of 2007 and 2006, respectively, as well as related tax benefits of $1.6 million
and $2.4 million, respectively. There were no modifications to awards as a result of the adoption
of SFAS 123R.

As of December 31, 2007, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested
awards amounted to $8.7 million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining
requisite service period of 1.9 years.

Stock Options.

Option grants are granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high
and low market price on the day of the grant. Stock option transactions for the three years ended
December 31, 2007 were as follows:

Restricted Stock Awards

. NiSource has granted restricted stock awards, which are restricted as to
transfer and are subject to forfeiture for specific periods from the date of grant and will vest
over periods from one year or more. If a participant’s employment is terminated prior to vesting
other than by reason of death, disability or retirement, restricted shares are forfeited. However,
awards may vest upon death, disability, or upon a change of control or retirement. At December 31,
2007 and 2006, NiSource had 10,000 nonvested restricted shares, which were not a part of the time
accelerated restricted stock award plan described below. No restricted stock awards were granted
or forfeited during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Time-accelerated Awards.

NiSource awarded restricted shares and restricted stock units that contain
provisions for time-accelerated vesting to key executives under the 1994 Plan. Most of these
awards were issued in January 2003 and January 2004. These awards of restricted stock or
restricted stock units generally vest over a period of six years or, in the case of restricted
stock units at age 62 if an employee would become age 62 within six years, but not less than three
years. If certain predetermined criteria involving measures of total shareholder return are met,
as measured at the end of the third year after the grant date, the awards vest at the end of the
third year. At December 31, 2007, NiSource had 571,625 nonvested awards which contain the
time-accelerated provisions. The total shareholder return measures established for the 2003 and
2004 awards were not met, therefore these grants did not have an accelerated vesting period.

The following table summarizes the activity related to restricted shares and restricted stock units
that contain provisions for time-accelerated vesting for the year ended December 31, 2007:

Contingent Share Awards.

In March 2007, 320,330 contingent shares were granted. The shares are
subject to both performance and service conditions. The performance conditions are based on
achievement of a non-GAAP financial measure (net operating earnings) that NiSource defines as
income from continuing operations adjusted for certain items. Per the agreement, to the extent base
performance conditions are exceeded during the year the award is granted, the award will be
increased in increments of 10 percent up to 50 percent. If the performance conditions are not met,
the grants will be cancelled and the shares will be forfeited. Subsequent to meeting the
performance conditions, an additional two year service period will then be required before the
shares vest on December 31, 2009. If after completing the performance conditions but prior to
completing the service conditions the employee terminates employment (1) due to retirement, having
attained age 55 and completed ten years of service, or (2) due to death or disability, the
employment conditions will lapse with respect to a pro rata portion of the contingent shares on the
date of termination. Termination due to any other reason will result in all contingent shares
awarded being forfeited effective the employee’s date of termination. As of December 31, 2007,
318,199 nonvested contingent shares were remaining. Employees will be entitled to receive
dividends upon vesting.


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

The grant date fair-value of the awards was $7.5 million, based on the average market price of
NiSource’s common stock at the date of grant of $23.46, which will be expensed net of forfeitures
over the vesting period of approximately 3 years. During 2007, base performance conditions were
exceeded, resulting in an increase of the number of shares to be issued upon vesting by 20 percent.
Accordingly, 62,319 additional shares were granted in January 2008. During the year ended December
31, 2007, $2.6 million of compensation expense, net of forfeitures, was recorded to Operation and
Maintenance Expense on the Consolidated Income Statement related to this contingent stock grant.

Non-employee Director Awards.

The Amended and Restated Non-employee Director Stock Incentive Plan,
which was approved by the Board and stockholders at the 2003 annual meeting, provides for the
issuance of up to 500,000 shares of common stock to non-employee directors. The Plan provides for
awards of restricted stock, stock options and restricted stock units, which vest in 20% increments
per year, with full vesting after five years. Awards under the Plan are subject to immediate
vesting in the event of the director’s death or disability, retirement at or after age 70, or a
change in control of NiSource. If a director’s service on the Board is terminated for any reason
other than retirement at or after age 70, death or disability, any awards of restricted stock,
stock options or restricted stock units are forfeited. No stock options have been granted under
the Non-employee Director Stock Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2007, 89,860 restricted shares
and 144,348 restricted stock units had been issued under the Plan.

Stock Appreciation Rights.

There were no stock appreciation rights outstanding at December 31,
2007 and 2006.

Unamortized debt expense, premium and discount on long-term debt applicable to outstanding bonds
are being amortized over the lives of such bonds. Reacquisition premiums have been deferred and
are being amortized. These premiums are not earning a regulatory return during the recovery
period.

Of NiSource’s long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2007 $119.0 million was issued by
NiSource’s affiliate, Capital Markets. The financial obligations of Capital Markets are subject to
a Support Agreement between NiSource and Capital Markets, under which NiSource has committed to
make payments of interest and principal on Capital Market’s obligations in the event of a failure
to pay by Capital Markets. Under the terms of the Support Agreement, in addition to the cash flow
from cash dividends paid to NiSource by any of its consolidated subsidiaries, the assets of
NiSource, other than the stock and assets of Northern Indiana, are available as recourse for the
benefit of Capital Market’s creditors. The carrying value of the NiSource assets, excluding the
assets of Northern Indiana, was $13.5 billion at December 31, 2007.

NiSource Finance has entered into interest rate swap agreements for $1,160 million of its
outstanding long-term debt. The effect of these agreements is to modify the interest rate
characteristics of a portion of their respective long-term debt from fixed to variable. Refer to
Note 8, “Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information regarding interest rate swaps.

NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five-year revolving credit facility.
NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of December 31,
2007, the ratio was 56.9%.

NiSource is also subject to certain other covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such
covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSource’s assets,
generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting
security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to 5% of NiSource’s consolidated net
tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and/or transfer


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

of NiSource’s assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit
facility also includes a cross-default provision, which triggers an event of default under the
credit facility in the event of any uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of
NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more.

NiSource’s bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However,
NiSource’s bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured
payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on
NiSource’s assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests,
preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at either 5% or 10% of
NiSource’s consolidated net tangible assets.

16. Short-Term Borrowings

During July 2006, NiSource Finance amended its $1.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility
increasing the aggregate commitment level to $1.5 billion, extending the termination date by one
year to July 2011, and reduced the cost of borrowing. The amended facility will help maintain a
reasonable cushion of short-term liquidity in anticipation of continuing volatile natural gas
prices.

As of December 31, 2007, NiSource had $83.0 million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding under
its five-year revolving credit facility. NiSource Finance maintains a five-year revolving line of
credit with a syndicate of financial institutions which can be used either for borrowings or the

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of
financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value:

Investments.

Where feasible, the fair value of investments is estimated based on market prices for
those or similar investments.

Long-term Debt.

The fair values of these securities are estimated based on the quoted market
prices for the same or similar issues or on the rates offered for securities of the same remaining
maturities. Certain premium costs associated with the early settlement of long-term debt are not
taken into consideration in determining fair value.

On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to
sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CORC, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement with Dresdner
Bank AG, also dated May 14, 2004, under the terms of which it sells an undivided percentage
ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a

commercial paper conduit. On July 1, 2006, the
agreement was amended to increase the program limit from $300 million to $350 million. The
agreement currently expires on June 27, 2008. As of December 31, 2007, $202.4 million of accounts
receivable had been sold by CORC.

Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping
and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives
a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services.

On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of
its trade receivables, as they originate, to NRC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana.
NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement with Citibank, N.A. under the terms of which it sells an
undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit.
The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. NRC’s
agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled expiration date of December 29, 2008,
and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2007, NRC had sold
$200 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new
receivables if Northern Indiana’s debt rating falls below BBB- or Baa3 at Standard and Poor’s or
Moody’s, respectively.

Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and
cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which
provides adequate compensation, for such services.

NiSource’s accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting based upon the conditions met
in SFAS No. 140. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor
and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or
other receivership. The transferors do not retain any interest in the receivables under both
agreements.

18. Other Commitments and Contingencies

A. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities.

NiSource expects that approximately
$1,356.9 million will be expended for construction and other investment purposes during 2008.

B. Guarantees and Indemnities.

As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries
enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on
behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit.
These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise
attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient
credit to accomplish the subsidiaries’ intended commercial purposes. The total guarantees and
indemnities in existence at December 31, 2007 and the years in which they expire were:

Guarantees of Subsidiaries Debt.

NiSource has guaranteed the payment of $5.1 billion of debt for
various wholly owned subsidiaries including NiSource Finance, and through a support agreement,
Capital Markets, which is reflected on NiSource’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The subsidiaries
are required to comply with certain financial covenants under the debt indenture and in the event
of default, NiSource would be obligated to pay the debt’s principal and related interest. NiSource
does not anticipate its subsidiaries will have any difficulty maintaining compliance.

Guarantees Supporting Energy Commodity Contracts of Subsidiaries.

NiSource has issued guarantees,
which support up to approximately $548.8 million of commodity-related payments for its current
subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and trading and those satisfying requirements under
forward gas sales agreements of current and former subsidiaries. These guarantees were provided to
counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and
electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity-related contracts subject to
these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Lines and Letters of Credit.

NiSource Finance maintains a five-year revolving line of credit with
a syndicate of financial institutions which can be used either for borrowings or the issuance of
letters of credit. On July 7, 2006, NiSource Finance amended the $1.25 billion five-year revolving
credit facility, increasing the aggregate commitment level to $1.5 billion and extending the
termination date by one year to July 2011. At December 31, 2007, NiSource had $1,061.0 million in
short-term borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. Through the five-year revolver and
through other letter of credit facilities, NiSource has issued stand-by letters of credit of
approximately $110.4 million for the benefit of third parties.

Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased
collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB- by
Standard and Poor’s or Baa3 by Moody’s. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the
ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $40 million. In addition to agreements with
ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse
change” provisions that could result in additional credit support such as letters of credit and
cash collateral to transact business. NiSource’s credit ratings with Standard and Poor’s and
Moody’s Investor Services are currently BBB- and Baa3, respectively.

Other Guarantees or Obligations.

On August 29, 2007, Millennium entered into a bank credit
agreement to finance the construction of the Millennium Pipeline project. As a condition precedent
to the credit agreement, NiSource issued a guarantee securing payment for 47.5%, its indirect
ownership interest percentage, of amounts borrowed under the credit agreement up until such time as
the amounts payable under the agreement are paid in full. The permanent financing is expected to
be completed in the first quarter of 2009. As of December 31, 2007, Millennium borrowed $153.0
million under the financing agreements, of which NiSource guaranteed $72.7 million. NiSource
recorded an accrued liability of approximately $3.6 million related to the fair value of this
guarantee.

On June 29, 2006, Columbia Transmission, Piedmont, and Hardy Storage entered into multiple
agreements to finance the construction of the Hardy Storage project, which is accounted for by
NiSource as an equity investment. Under the financing agreement, Columbia Transmission issued
guarantees securing payment for 50% of any amounts issued in connection with Hardy Storage up until
such time as the project is placed in service and operated within certain specified parameters. As
of December 31, 2007, Hardy Storage borrowed $123.4 million under the financing agreement, for
which Columbia Transmission recorded an accrued liability of approximately $1.2 million related to
the fair value of its guarantee securing payment for $61.7 million which is 50% of the amount
borrowed.

NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $80.0 million, which guarantee
performance of the seller’s covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and
warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees
are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource
would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the
aforementioned guarantees is remote.

NiSource has issued other guarantees supporting derivative related payments associated with
interest rate swap agreements issued by NiSource Finance, operating leases for many of its
subsidiaries and for other agreements entered into by its current and former subsidiaries.

C. Other Legal Proceedings.

In the normal course of its business, NiSource and its subsidiaries
have been named as defendants in various legal proceedings. In the opinion of management, the
ultimate disposition of these currently asserted claims will not have a material adverse impact on
NiSource’s consolidated financial position.

In the case of Tawney, et al. v. Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., the Plaintiffs, who are West
Virginia landowners, filed a lawsuit in early 2003 against CNR alleging that CNR underpaid
royalties on gas produced on their land by


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

improperly deducting post-production costs and not paying a fair value for the gas. In December
2004, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion to add NiSource and Columbia as defendants. Plaintiffs
also claimed that the defendants fraudulently concealed the deduction of post-production charges.
The court certified the case as a class action that includes any person who, after July 31, 1990,
received or is due royalties from CNR (and its predecessors or successors) on lands lying within
the boundary of the state of West Virginia. All claims by the government of the United States are
excluded from the class. Although NiSource sold CNR in 2003, NiSource remains obligated to manage
this litigation and for the majority of any damages ultimately awarded to the plaintiffs. On
January 27, 2007, the jury hearing the case returned a verdict against all defendants in the amount
of $404.3 million; this is comprised of $134.3 million in compensatory damages and $270 million in
punitive damages. In January 2008, defendants filed their petition for appeal, and will be filing
an amended petition in March, with the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, which may or may not
accept the appeal. NiSource has not established a reserve for the punitive damages portion of the
verdict.

D. Tax Matters.

NiSource records liabilities for potential income tax assessments. The accruals
relate to tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on management’s estimate
of the ultimate resolution of these positions. These liabilities may be affected by changing
interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, or the expiration of the statute of
limitations. NiSource is a part of the IRS’s Large and Mid-Size Business program. As a result,
each year’s federal income tax return is typically audited by the IRS. The audits of all tax years
through 2004 have been completed and settled and years through 2002 are closed to further
assessment. It is anticipated that the IRS audit of years 2005 and 2006 will begin in the first
quarter of 2008. There are no state income tax audits in progress at this time.

On July 28, 2006, the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals issued a favorable decision in the matter of
Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation vs. Thomas M. Zaino, Tax Commissioner of Ohio. The Board
ruled that Columbia Transmission’s Ohio operations fall within the statutory definition of both a
“natural gas company” and a “pipeline company” and that Columbia Transmission’s property is to be
assessed at the significantly lower “natural gas company” assessment ratio beginning with the 2001
tax year. Columbia Transmission also made constitutional arguments in the case. The Ohio Tax
Commissioner appealed the decision to the Ohio Supreme Court on July 31, 2006, which heard oral
arguments on May 2, 2007. On February 14, 2008, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Ohio
Tax Commissioner, finding that the Board of Tax Appeals erred on the statutory definition issue and
that Columbia Transmission’s constitutional challenges had no merit. All taxes subject to the
appeal had been paid under protest, so there is no adverse impact to NiSource’s financial
statements from the decision. NiSource continues to review its options with respect to this
matter.

E. Environmental Matters.

General.

The operations of NiSource are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations intended to protect the public health and the environment. Such
environmental laws and regulations affect operations as they relate to impacts on air, water and
land.

Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United
States and worldwide to reduce so-called “greenhouse gases” such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of
burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily
report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in the EPA’s
Climate Leaders program. On April 2, 2007, in Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court ruled that
the EPA does have authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases if it
is determined that greenhouse gases have a negative impact on human health or the environment.
NiSource will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register
and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

Implementation of the fine particulate matter and ozone national ambient air quality standards may
require imposition of additional controls on boilers, engines and turbines. On April 15, 2004, the
EPA finalized the eight-hour ozone nonattainment area designations. After designation, the Clean
Air Act provides for a process for promulgation of rules specifying compliance level, compliance
deadline, and necessary controls to be implemented within designated areas over the next few years.
Resulting state rules could require additional reductions in NOx emissions from facilities owned
by electric generation and gas transmission and storage operations. On March 29, 2007, the EPA
signed a rule to govern implementation of the NAAQS for particulate matter (PM-2.5) that the EPA


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

NiSource Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

promulgated in 1997. The rule addresses a wide range of issues, including state rulemaking
requirements as well as attainment demonstration requirements and deadlines. States must evaluate
for potential reduction measures for the emission of particulate matter and its precursors such as
SO2 and NOx. The rule includes a conditional presumption that, for power plants subject to the
CAIR, compliance with CAIR would satisfy Reasonably Available Control Measures and Reasonably
Available Control Technology requirements for SO2 and NOx. States must submit their SIPs to the
EPA by April 2008. Also, on September 21, 2006, the EPA issued revisions to the NAAQS for
particulate matter. The final rule increased the stringency of the current fine particulate
(PM2.5) standard, added a new standard for inhalable coarse particulate (particulate matter between
10 and 2.5 microns in diameter), and revoked the annual PM10 standards while retaining the 24-hour
PM10 standards. The EPA designations of areas not meeting the new fine particulate matter
standards are due by November 2009, effective in April 2010. The SIPs detailing how states will
reduce emissions to meet the NAAQS will be due three years later with attainment due by April 2015
with a possible five year extension to April 2020. These actions could require further reductions
in NOx emissions from various emission sources in and near nonattainment areas, including
reductions from Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. NiSource will continue to closely monitor
developments in these matters and cannot accurately estimate the timing or cost of emission
controls at this time.

On June 21, 2007, the EPA announced a proposed rule to tighten the NAAQS for ozone. The proposed
rule includes a provision to increase the stringency of the standard from the current 0.08 ppm to
between 0.070 and 0.075 ppm. For the new standard, the EPA is considering a range of options from
further tightening the standard to 0.060 ppm to retaining the level at the current standard.
Additionally, the EPA is proposing two alternatives for the secondary ozone standard that includes
a new cumulative standard even more stringent than the primary one or establishment of the
secondary standard at the level of the primary standard. Depending on the stringency and form of
any such revision to the standards, the number of areas that fail to attain the standards could
significantly increase across the country. If a number of areas do not meet the new standards,
resulting rulemakings to implement the standards and improve air quality in these areas over the
next several years could lead to additional pressure to reduce emissions of NOx, an ozone
precursor, from facilities owned by electric generation and gas transmission and storage
operations. NiSource will closely monitor developments in these matters and cannot at this time
accurately estimate the timing or cost of emission controls that may eventually be required.

Gas Distribution Operations.

Several Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are potentially
responsible parties at waste disposal sites under the CERCLA (commonly known as Superfund) and
similar state laws, as well as at MGP sites, which such subsidiaries, or their corporate
predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries may be
required to share in the cost of cleanup of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution
Operations subsidiaries have responsibility for corrective action under the RCRA for closure and
cleanup costs associated with underground storage tanks and under the Toxic Substances Control Act
for cleanup of PCBs. The final costs of cleanup have not yet been determined. As site
investigations and cleanup proceed and as additional information becomes available reserves are
adjusted.

A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution
Operations subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has
identified up to 86 such sites and initial investigations have been conducted at 54 sites.
Additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 50 sites and remedial
measures have been implemented or completed at 37 sites. This effort includes the sites contained
in the January 2004 agreement entered into with the IDEM, Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas, and other
Indiana utilities under the Indiana Voluntary Remediation Program. Only those site investigation,
characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered “probable
and reasonably estimable” under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable,
reserves will be adjusted. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent
environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this
time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management
expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more
facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and
reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the SEC’s SAB
No. 92, SFAS No. 5 and SOP No. 96-1. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, reserves of approximately
$63.4 million and $57.1 million, respectively, have been recorded to cover probable environmental
response actions for Gas Distribution Operations.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations.

Columbia Transmission continues to conduct
characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order
by Consent. The program pursuant to the Administrative Order by Consent covers approximately 245
facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement
stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization has been performed at all
sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for
approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at
the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at all
but 7 of the 245 facilities. The AOC was amended in 2007 to facilitate payment of EPA oversight
costs and to remove remediated sites from the AOC. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the remaining
environmental liability recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for Gas Transmission and
Storage Operations was approximately $5.4 million and $6.3 million, respectively.

Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are potentially responsible parties at several waste
disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws. The potential liability is believed to be de
minimis. However, the final allocation of cleanup costs has yet to be determined. As site
investigations and cleanups proceed and as additional information becomes available reserves will
be adjusted.

On February 21, 2007, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection provided representatives
of Columbia Transmission with a proposed Consent Order and Agreement covering an unmanned equipment
storage site located in rural southwest Pennsylvania. The proposed order alleges that Columbia
Transmission has violated the state’s Clean Streams Act and Solid Waste Management Act by
discharging petroleum products onto the property and into the waters of the state. In addition to
requiring remediation and monitoring activities at the site, the state has proposed penalties for
these violations. Columbia Transmission plans to engage in further discussions with the agency
regarding the proposed order, including the rationale for the proposed penalty. The site in
question is subject to an existing EPA Administrative Consent Order.

In October, 2006, the Ohio EPA released a preliminary NOx control rule covering the Cleveland-Akron
ozone nonattainment area. The final rule for this eight county area became effective on December
22, 2007. Evaluation of this new final rule determined that no existin

g

Columbia facilities are
significantly impacted based on the horsepower applicability threshold. The possibility does still
exist for the rule to be expanded to cover the entire state. This future expansion could require
additional controls and/or operational restrictions at numerous compressor stations so Columbia
Transmission is continuing their dialogue with Ohio EPA on future rule developments.

On September 26, 2007, Columbia Transmission received an NOV related to bentonite discharge
associated with a horizontal directional drill operation for the Hardy Storage project. On
November 29, 2007, Columbia Transmission received an NOV related to the collapse of Swift Run
stream bed associated with the same horizontal directional drill operation. NiSource has provided
the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality a draft Corrective Action plan and continues to
work with the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality in finalizing this plan. The amount of
fines are uncertain at this time. Stream restoration activities are continuing. Continued
monitoring of the stream will occur for the next six months to two years.

Electric Operations.

Air.

In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply
with the EPA’s NOx SIP call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to
reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional
transport of ozone. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules was required by May
31, 2004. To comply with the rule, Northern Indiana developed a NOx compliance plan, which
included the installation of Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its
active generating stations and is currently in compliance with the NOx limits. In implementing the
NOx compliance plan; Northern Indiana has expended approximately $290 million as of December 31,
2007. Actual costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand and resource
constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for
additional control technology.

Implementation of the fine particulate matter and ozone national ambient air quality standards may
require imposition of additional controls on coal-fired boilers. On April 15, 2004, the EPA
finalized the eight-hour ozone nonattainment area designations. After designation, the Clean Air
Act provides for a process for promulgation of rules specifying compliance level, compliance
deadline, and necessary controls to be implemented within designated

areas over the next few years.
Resulting state rules could require additional reductions in NOx emissions from these boilers.

On September 21, 2006, the EPA issued revisions to the NAAQS for particulate matter as described
above under, “General.” The new rules set forth in this standard could impact the emission control
requirements for coal-fired boilers including Northern Indiana’s electric generating stations.
Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor developments in these matters and cannot
accurately estimate the impact, timing or cost of emission controls at this time.

On March 10, 2005, the EPA issued the CAIR final regulations. The rule establishes phased
reductions of NOx and SO2 from 28 Eastern states, including electric utilities in Indiana, by
establishing an annual emissions cap for NOx and SO2 and an additional cap on NOx emissions during
the ozone control season. On March 15, 2006, the EPA signed three related rulemakings providing
final regulatory decisions on implementing the CAIR. The EPA, in one of the rulings, denied
several petitions for reconsideration of various aspects of the CAIR, including requests by
Northern Indiana to reconsider SO2 and NOx allocations. The main rulemaking established federal
implementation plans, or FIPs, for power plants to ensure that the emissions reductions required by
the CAIR are achieved on schedule and provide criteria, whereby SIPs that meet a majority of the
federal requirements or abbreviated SIPs could be approved if submitted by the states within six
months of the September 2006 deadline. As an affected state, Indiana structured, and preliminarily
adopted in June 2006, a draft rule to meet the EPA abbreviated CAIR SIP requirements and should
therefore be eligible for a six-month extension of the submittal deadline. The Air Pollution
Control Board adopted the final rules on November 1, 2006. The CAIR rules became effective in
Indiana on February 25, 2007. In a petition filed with the IURC in December 2006, Northern Indiana
provided plans for the first phase of the emission control construction required to address the
Phase I CAIR requirements and a request for appropriate cost treatment and recovery. Northern
Indiana’s plan includes the upgrade of existing emission controls on three generating units for an
estimated cost of $23 million and anticipates that these expenses are recoverable. Northern
Indiana will continue to closely monitor developments in these matters and expects to install
additional emission controls for the second phase of CAIR, but cannot accurately estimate the
timing or cost of the emission controls at this time.

On October 3, 2007, the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board adopted, with minor changes from the
EPA Clean Air Mercury Rule, the state rule to implement EPA’s CAMR. The rule became effective on
February 3, 2008, with compliance required in 2010. The EPA FIP rule, published December 22, 2006,
has not been finalized and is intended only as a backstop for states such as Indiana that missed
the November 17, 2006 submittal deadline but are working diligently to finalize its state rule.
The IDEM has indicated it is planning on utilizing an option in the FIP that allows the state to
submit a request for partial approval to use the IDEM’s allowance allocation methodology until the
EPA is able to approve the full state plan. The state’s request for partial approval will be due
to the EPA upon the effective date of the final FIP, estimated to be in the first half of 2008.
The EPA would not record allowance allocations for 2010 until September 2008. The FIP would be
rescinded upon EPA acceptance of the Indiana rule. On February 8, 2008, the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated two EPA rules addressing utility mercury
emissions that are the stimulus for the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board’s CAMR. The first is
the EPA’s rule delisting coal and oil-fired electric generating units from the list of sources
whose emissions are regulated under section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7412.

Revision of
December 2000 Regulatory Finding

(“Delisting Rule”), 70 Fed. Reg. 15,994 (March 29, 2005). The
second is the EPA’s rule that set performance standards for new coal-fired electric generating
units and established total mercury emission limits for States along with a cap-and-trade program
for new and existing coal-fired electric generating units.

Standards of Performance for New and
Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Steam Generating Units

(“CAMR”), 70 Fed. Reg. 28,606
(May 18, 2005). This decision and the EPA’s response will affect the implementation and timing of
the installation of controls to address potential mercury reduction obligations.
Northern Indiana will closely monitor developments regarding any further action by the EPA and
subsequent regulatory developments from the EPA and/or the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board in
this matter.

Local air quality has improved in three counties in which Northern Indiana generating assets are
located. In recognition of this improvement in local air quality, the IDEM prepared petitions for
submittal to the EPA seeking redesignation of the Indiana counties of Lake, Porter, and LaPorte to
attainment of the eight-hour ozone NAAQS. Final EPA rulemaking approving the LaPorte County
redesignation became effective on July 19, 2007. The EPA approval for Lake and Porter counties is
undergoing further evaluation and may be delayed until after the 2008


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

ozone season due to monitored
values in 2007 at one site that put the design value just above the NAAQS. On October 3, 2007, the
Air Pollution Control Board adopted the redesignation of LaPorte County to attainment as part of a
reformatting of the state attainment designation rule. The rule became effective January 28, 2008.
Upon promulgation of the EPA and subsequent IDEM regulations to implement the redesignations to
attainment, new source review rules are expected to change from nonattainment new source review
rules to prevention of significant deterioration while measures responsible for existing emission
reductions would continue. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor developments in these
matters and cannot accurately estimate the outcome or timing of the approval of the petitions.

On March 14, 2007, Indiana proposed a draft rule to implement the EPA BART requirements for
reduction of regional haze. On October 3, 2007, the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board adopted,
with some minor modifications, a rule to implement the EPA BART requirements for reduction of
regional haze. The rule became effective February 22, 2008, with compliance with any required BART
controls within five years (2013). The language of the final rule relies upon the provisions of
the Indiana CAIR to meet requirements for NOx and SO2 and does not impose any additional control
requirements on coal-fired generation emissions, including those of Northern Indiana. As part of
the BART analysis process, the IDEM is still evaluating the potential impact of particulate matter
from electric generating units to determine if there are impacts on Class I areas. Northern
Indiana will work closely with IDEM regarding the particulate matter analysis requirements of the
BART analysis. Northern Indiana will closely monitor developments in these matters and at this
time cannot accurately estimate the timing or cost of any emission controls that may be required.

In late 1999, the EPA initiated a New Source Review enforcement action against several industries,
including the electric utility industry, concerning rule interpretations that have been the subject
of recent (prospective) reform regulations. Northern Indiana has received and responded to the EPA
information requests on this subject, most recently in June 2002. The EPA issued an NOV to
Northern Indiana on September 29, 2004, for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act and the SIP.
Specifically, the NOV alleges that modifications were made to certain boiler units at the Michigan
City, Schahfer, and Bailly Generating Stations between the years of 1985 and 1995 without obtaining
appropriate air permits for the modifications. An adverse outcome in this matter could require
capital expenditures beyond the EPA requirements that cannot be determined at this time and could
require payment of substantial penalties. On April 2, 2007, in Environmental Defense v. Duke
Energy Corp, the US Supreme Court overturned a Fourth Circuit Court decision related to the
determination of a ‘modification’ under the Clean Air Act’s new source review program. The Supreme
Court ruled that under the new source review program an ‘annual emission increase’ test must be
applied and rejected Duke Energy Corp’s arguments and a Fourth Circuit Court decision that a
‘maximum hourly’ test was appropriate. The case will now go back to the trial court to address
whether or not a ‘modification’ occurred and whether Duke Energy Corp is required to install
pollution control devices and pay any penalties. Northern Indiana is unable, at this time, to
predict the timing or outcome of this EPA action.

Water.

The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative program is expected to add new water quality
standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern
Indiana’s three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The state of Indiana has
promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA
approval. The NPDES water discharge permit for Michigan City Generating Station has been issued
and became effective on April 1, 2006. Engineering studies have begun to determine specific
compliance costs for this facility. The permit for the Bailly Generating Station was issued on
June 26, 2006, and became effective on August 1, 2006. Northern Indiana has since appealed the
Bailly Generating Station NPDES permit, due to an unacceptable internal outfall monitoring permit
condition. The Bailly NPDES permit is currently being modified to resolve the monitoring issue and
to address the 316(b) rule status due to the
remand mentioned below. Due to additional pending studies, the cost of complying with the permit
requirements cannot be estimated at this time.

On February 16, 2004, the EPA Administrator signed the Phase II Rule of the Clean Water Act Section
316(b) which requires all large existing steam electric generating stations meet certain
performance standards to reduce the effects on aquatic organisms at their cooling water intake
structures. The rule became effective on September 7, 2004. Under this rule, stations will either
have to demonstrate that the performance of their existing fish protection systems meet the new
standards or develop new systems, such as a closed-cycle cooling tower. On January 25, 2007, the
Second Circuit in a court decision on the Phase II 316(b) rule, remanded for EPA reconsideration
the


ITEM 8.

options providing flexibility for meeting the requirements of the rule. On March 20, 2007, the
EPA issued a guidance memo advising its Regional Administrators that the Agency considers the
316(b), Phase II Rule governing cooling water withdrawals suspended and will be issuing a Federal
Register notice to that effect. On July 9, 2007, the EPA published a notice in the Federal
Register suspending the Phase II rule. The notice explained that the EPA is not accepting comments
on the suspension and notes that “best professional judgment” is to be used in making 316(b)
decisions. The EPA will need to propose a revised 316(b) rule and/or provide guidance to address
the impact of the court decision. Northern Indiana will closely monitor the EPA rule developments.

On July 5, 2007, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals denied the petitions for rehearing asking the
court to reconsider its remand of the Phase II 316(b) ruling. Various parties submitted petitions
for a

writ of certiorari

to the U. S. Supreme Court in early November seeking to reverse the Second
Circuit Court’s decision. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor this activity.

IDEM recently issued a renewed NPDES Permit for the Northern Indiana’s Michigan City Generating
Station. The permit requires that the facility meet the Great Lakes Initiative discharge limits
for copper. The Michigan City Generating Station has a four year compliance schedule to meet these
limits, which ends April 1, 2011. Northern Indiana is evaluating alternatives for treating copper
in wastewater at the Michigan City Generating Station.

Great Lakes Initiative-based discharge limits for mercury have also been set for both the Bailly
and the Michigan City Generating Stations. Northern Indiana will collect data, develop and
implement pollution reduction program plans, to demonstrate progress in reducing mercury discharge.

Remediation.

Northern Indiana is a potentially responsible party under the CERCLA and similar
state laws at two waste disposal sites and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other
potentially responsible parties. At one site, the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study was
submitted to EPA in 2007. The EPA has issued a proposed plan to remediate the site which is in
the public comment period. At the second site, Northern Indiana has agreed to conduct a Remedial
Investigation and Feasibility Study in the vicinity of the third party, state-permitted landfill
where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. In addition, Northern Indiana has
corrective action liability under the RCRA for three facilities that historically stored hazardous
waste.

On March 31, 2005, the EPA and Northern Indiana entered into an Administrative Order on Consent
under the authority of Section 3008(h) of the RCRA for the Bailly Station. The order requires
Northern Indiana to identify the nature and extent of releases of hazardous waste and hazardous
constituents from the facility. Northern Indiana must also remediate any release of hazardous
constituents that present an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. Investigation
activities are complete and Northern Indiana is awaiting EPA comments on proposed remedial actions.
A reserve has been established to fund the remedial measures proposed to EPA. The final costs of
cleanup could change based on EPA review.

On September 13, 2006, IDEM advised Northern Indiana that further investigation of historic
releases from two previously removed underground storage tanks at the Schahfer Generating Station
would need to be investigated. Northern Indiana completed an investigation of potentially impacted
soils and groundwater in 2007 and submitted results to the IDEM Leaking Underground Storage Tank
section. As of the end of 2007, the IDEM has not responded.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, reserves of approximately $3.1 million and $3.6 million,
respectively, have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions for Electric
Operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites cannot be estimated at this time
but could be significant.

Other Operations.

NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liabilities, including cleanup
liabilities associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations,
petroleum operations, and CER. The most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP
sites whereas less significant liabilities are associated with former petroleum operations and
former mercury metering stations. A total of four MGP sites have been identified with
investigation having been completed at three sites and remediation at two sites. In regards to
these sites NiSource affiliate Columbia Petroleum and five other companies received notice from the
EPA on November 20, 2006 to enter into an order to investigate and remediate four parcels which
included the Macungie Bulk Terminal once owned and operated by Columbia Petroleum for a limited
duration. Negotiations with the EPA

ultimately resulted in an AOC in which the EPA did not require
Columbia Petroleum’s participation. That is, an AOC was entered into on or about July 23, 2007 by
Farm & Home and CRL Holdings, LP requiring free product removal and soil vapor recovery at the
property formerly owned and operated by Columbia Petroleum. Pipeline Petroleum Inc., the owner to
east, concurrently entered into two AOCs with respect to its adjacent terminal, including the AOC
involving the Farm & Home and CRL Holdings, LP. Farm & Home further entered into a separate AOC
concerning its nearby terminals to the west. Columbia Petroleum was not named as a party to any of
the AOCs but is defending Farm & Home with respect to the AOC involving Farm & Home, CRL Holdings,
LP and Pipeline Petroleum Inc. Coverage for that defense and associated remedial costs are being
provided by Greenwich under a reservation of rights. An Interim Remedial Measure for mechanical
free product recovery was approved by the EPA on September 5, 2007. A Remedial Action Plan was
subsequently conditionally approved by the EPA on September 18, 2007. Both the Interim Remedial
Measure and Remedial Action Plan are currently being implemented by the parties. The owner of a
terminal immediately to the south, Buckeye Pipeline, has been under a separate AOC with the EPA for
more than a year. Buckeye Pipeline recently announced its intention to acquire (via a stock
purchase) Farm & Home sometime in 2008.

The ultimate liability in connection with these contamination sites will depend upon many factors
including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible
parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only
those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered “probable and
reasonably estimable” under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96-1. As costs become probable and
reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any
environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable,
will not have a material adverse effect on NiSource’s financial position.

Environmental Reserves.

It is management’s continued intent to address environmental issues in
cooperation with regulatory authorities in such a manner as to achieve mutually acceptable
compliance plans. However, there can be no assurance that fines and penalties will not be
incurred. Management expects a significant portion of environmental assessment and remediation
costs to be recoverable through rates for certain NiSource companies.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, reserves of approximately $77.2 million and $72.6 million,
respectively, have been recorded to cover probable corrective actions at sites where NiSource has
environmental remediation liability. Regulatory assets have been recorded to the extent
environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered in rates. NiSource accrues for costs
associated with environmental remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs is probable
and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, regardless of when the expenditures are actually made.
The undiscounted estimated future expenditures are based on many factors including currently
enacted laws and regulations, existing technology and estimated site-specific costs whereby
assumptions may be made about the nature and extent of site contamination, the extent of cleanup
efforts, costs of alternative cleanup methods and other variables. NiSource’s estimated
environmental remediation liability will be refined as events in the remediation process occur.
Actual remediation costs may differ materially from NiSource’s estimates due to the dependence on
the factors listed above.

F. Operating and Capital Lease Commitments.

NiSource leases assets in several areas of its
operations. Payments made in connection with operating leases were $53.5 million in 2007, $58.5
million in 2006 and $54.7 million in 2005, and are primarily charged to operation and maintenance
expense as incurred. Capital leases and related accumulated depreciation included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2.6 million and $1.1 million at December 31, 2007, and $4.2
million and $2.3 million at December 31, 2006, respectively.

G. Purchase and Service Obligations.

NiSource has entered into various purchase and service
agreements whereby NiSource is contractually obligated to make certain minimum payments in future
periods. NiSource’s purchase obligations are for the purchase of physical quantities of natural
gas, electricity and coal. NiSource’s service agreements encompass a broad range of business
support and maintenance functions which are generally described below.

NiSource’s subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical
quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent minimum quantities of
these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices.

NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and
storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2008 to 2027, require
NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges.

In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad
range of business process and support services to NiSource. On December 12, 2007, NiSource
Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM. Under the amended agreement, NiSource will
reassume responsibility for business support functions including human resource administration,
payroll, accounts payable, supply chain (procurement), sales centers, and the majority of meter to
cash operations (billing and collections). During 2007, NiSource had already begun to bring certain
finance and accounting functions back within the company. These functions include general
accounting, fixed asset accounting, and budgeting. In the Customer Contact Centers, interim
operational responsibility will be retained by IBM, although NiSource intends to pursue a direct
arrangement with Vertex, which currently operates the contact center as a subcontractor for IBM.
IBM will retain responsibility for information technology operations. Support functions returning
to NiSource will be transitioned in a phased approach throughout 2008. NiSource Corporate Services
will continue to pay IBM for the amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges,
with the variable charges fluctuating based actual need for such services. Based on the currently
projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $770
million to IBM in service fees and project costs over the remaining 7.5 year term, of which $5.8
million is reflected as capital lease payment. Under the original agreement, NiSource Corporate
Services expected to pay IBM approximately $1.6 billion in services fees and project cost over ten
years.

Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by
IBM), NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee,
repayment of IBM’s un-recovered capital investments, and IBM wind-down expense. This termination
fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of
the termination.

Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation
services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various
periods through 2013.

Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products
and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under
this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a
combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be
due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty-year contract
period.

Whiting Clean Energy has a service agreement with General Electric for certain operation and
maintenance activities for its cogeneration facility located at BP’s Whiting , Indiana refinery for
which certain minimum fees are required. The agreement extends through 2023. The agreement
provides for a $10 million termination penalty to be paid by Whiting Clean Energy to General
Electric to buy out or otherwise terminate the agreement.

NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline
business software requiring equal annual payments of $5.0 million per annual period over 10 years
beginning in January 2008. While this software was not placed in service as of December 31, 2007,
testing was substantially completed and NiSource Corporate Services did not have the ability to
terminate the agreement without cause. Final acceptance of the software installation was made on
January 2, 2008 and the software is expected to be placed in service in first half of 2008. The
payments associated with this license agreement is included within, “Other service obligations,” in
the table of contractual commitments.

22. Segments of Business

Under provisions of SFAS No. 131, operating segments are components of an enterprise for which
separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating
decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource
Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker.

NiSource’s operations are divided into four primary business segments. The Gas Distribution
Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and
industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana, Massachusetts,
Maine and New Hampshire. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas
transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers
located in northeastern, mid-Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia.
The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of
Indiana. The Other Operations segment primarily includes gas and power marketing, and ventures
focused on distributed power generation technologies, including cogeneration facilities, fuel cells
and storage systems.

The following table provides information about business segments. NiSource uses operating income
as its primary measurement for each of the reported segments and makes decisions on finance,
dividends and taxes at the corporate level on a consolidated basis. Segment revenues include
intersegment sales to affiliated subsidiaries, which are eliminated in consolidation. Affiliated
sales are recognized on the basis of prevailing market, regulated prices or at levels provided for
under contractual agreements. Operating income is derived from revenues and expenses directly
associated with each segment.

23. Hurricanes

In September 2004, hurricane Ivan damaged certain Columbia Gulf property and in the third quarter
of 2005, Columbia Gulf incurred additional damages to its pipeline assets and facilities as a
result of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Total costs recorded to repair damages in 2007, 2006, and
2005 were $12.1 million, $42.3 million, and $4.5 million respectively. Columbia Gulf is covered by
insurance for these damages subject to a $1.0 million deductible per incident. Amounts billed for
reimbursement through insurance are recorded within “Accounts Receivable,” on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, Columbia Gulf had received
$8.5 million, $4.0 million, and zero in insurance recoveries related to these damages and incurred
a deductible of zero, $1.8 million, and $1.2 million as a deductible under its insurance policies.
Costs to repair damages are recognized when costs are incurred or as information becomes available
to estimate the damages incurred. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, Columbia Gulf had a receivable
of $43.4 million and $39.8 million related to the hurricanes.

24. Subsequent Events

Pending Sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas

On February 15, 2008, NiSource reached a definitive agreement under which Unitil Corporation will
acquire NiSource subsidiaries Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas for $160 million plus net working
capital at the time


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

of closing. Historically, net working capital has averaged approximately $25
million. Under the terms of the transaction, Unitil Corporation will acquire Northern Utilities, a
local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New
Hampshire and Granite State Gas, an 86-mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily
located in Maine and New Hampshire. The transaction, expected to be complete by the end of 2008,
is subject to federal and state regulatory approvals. During the quarter ended March 31, 2008,
NiSource expects to recognize an after tax loss of approximately $65 million related to the pending
sale and to account for Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas as discontinued operations.

NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the company’s larger
acquisition of Bay State. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Bay State as a core component of
the company’s long-term, investment-driven growth strategy.

Hartsville Compressor Station

On February 5, 2008, a tornado struck Columbia Gulf’s Hartsville Compressor Station in Macon
County, Tennessee. The damage to the facility forced Columbia Gulf to declare force majeure
because no gas was flowing through this portion of the pipeline system while a facility assessment
was being performed and the current contractual transportation agreements of 2.156 Bcf per day
could not be met. Since that time Columbia Gulf has restored the majority of gas flow to 1.5 Bcf
per day, however full contractual agreements still cannot be met. Although temporary solutions are
being investigated to restore system capabilities as soon as possible, a permanent solution for
rebuilding the compressor station may take 18 to 24 months. Over the course of the next 24 months,
firm transportation contracts of approximately 1.1 Bcf per day will expire and there is a risk some
of those may not be renewed due to the reduced system capabilities.

NiSource expects the majority of the reconstruction costs of the compressor station and ancillary
facilities plus business interruption losses will be recoverable through insurance during the 18 to
24 month period.

ITEM 9.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

NiSource Inc.

None.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

NiSource’s chief executive officer and its principal financial officer, after evaluating the
effectiveness of NiSource’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)), have concluded based on the evaluation required by paragraph (b) of
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 that, as of the end of the period covered by this report,
NiSource’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance
that financial information was processed, recorded and reported accurately as evidenced by the
material weakness described below.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

NiSource management, including NiSource’s principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, are responsible for establishing and maintaining NiSource’s internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. However, management would note that a control system can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
NiSource’s management has adopted the framework set forth in the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission report, Internal Control — Integrated Framework, the most
commonly used and understood framework for evaluating internal control over financial reporting, as
its framework for evaluating the reliability and effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Management’s evaluation of internal controls for 2007 identified a material weakness in
Northern Indiana’s unbilled revenue estimating process.

Northern Indiana detected an error in its unbilled revenue calculation and revised its estimate for
unbilled electric and gas revenues in the fourth quarter of 2007. Over a period of several years,
Northern Indiana used incorrect customer usage data to calculate its unbilled revenue and effective
controls from both a design and operating effectiveness perspective were not in place to ensure the adequate calculation and recording of unbilled revenues.
As a result, this correction reduced net revenues by $25.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
The unbilled revenue estimates were never billed to customers.

As a
result of the material weakness identified above, NiSource management
has concluded that NiSource’s internal control over financial
reporting is not effective as of December 31, 2007. NiSource management has developed a comprehensive plan to strengthen Northern Indiana’s unbilled
revenue estimating process and has implemented additional internal controls to verify the accuracy
of the monthly calculation. Management is confident that the material weakness will be remediated
during the first half of 2008.

Deloitte
& Touche LLP, NiSource’s independent registered public
accounting firm, issued an attestation  report on NiSource’s
internal controls over financial reporting which is contained in Item
8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Changes in Internal Controls

On July 1, 2006, NiSource began a multi-year process of transforming the information systems. As
its initial step in this process, NiSource began using new systems in the finance and accounting,
supply chain and human resource functions that support the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations,
Corporate and Other Operations segments. NiSource adjusted the internal controls that apply to
these functional areas to align them with the new systems and revised business processes.

As a part of the transformation initiatives, many new information technology systems and process
changes had an accelerated time-line for completion, which created the risk of operational delays,
potential errors and control failures which could impact NiSource and its financial condition. In
August 2006, further implementation of certain information technology systems was delayed due to
difficulties encountered with the first wave of new system implementations.

In early 2007, a high-level team of NiSource and IBM resources began an overall reassessment of the
outsourcing initiative primarily to focus on operational and transformational improvements and
remediation and to develop an integrated plan that enables NiSource to achieve its business objectives going forward. In the
first quarter of 2007, NiSource decided to bring certain finance and accounting functions back
within the company. These functions included general accounting, fixed asset accounting, and
budgeting. In December 2007, NiSource and IBM finalized a restructuring of their business services
agreement. Under the restructured agreement, IBM will primarily provide information technology
services, with a number of other business service functions to be transitioned back

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (continued)

NiSource Inc.

to the NiSource
organization. Going forward, NiSource will be in a position to more effectively manage its
employee and administrative expenses, while ensuring delivery of services needed to meet the
company’s needs.

Other than the internal control changes referenced above, there have been no other changes in
NiSource’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year covered by this report
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, NiSource’s internal control over
financial reporting.
