    storage and data management solutions, we provide global service
    and support and work to simplify customer environments by
    utilizing open standards and closely collaborating and
    partnering with other industry leaders. We help solve customer
    business challenges and help enable them to maximize return on
    investment through a combination of products, technologies,
    services, and partnerships.

Our products and services are designed to meet the expansive
    requirements and demanding service levels of large enterprises
    and their mission-critical business applications. To better meet
    these needs, we partner with key industry leaders, such as Cisco
    Systems, Inc., IBM Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, SAP
    Corporation,



Symantec Corporation and VMware, Inc. to develop integrated

    operations in over 130 locations around the world.

NetApp
    Product Overview

We offer highly available, scalable and cost-effective storage
    solutions that incorporate our unified storage platform and the
    feature-rich functionality of our data and storage resource
    management software. We believe that our solutions help improve
    enterprise productivity, performance and profitability, while
    providing investment protection and enhanced asset utilization.
    Our enterprise-class storage solutions are complemented by our
    services expertise to enable interoperability and optimization
    in the context of the application and IT infrastructure within
    which they are deployed.

Data
    ONTAP Software

Our Fabric-Attached Storage (FAS) and V-Series storage solutions
    are based on Data
    ONTAP

®

,

    a highly scalable and flexible operating system that uniquely
    supports any mix of storage area network (SAN), network-attached
    storage (NAS) and Internet Small Computer System Interface
    (iSCSI) environments concurrently. This unified storage software
    platform is compatible with
    UNIX

®

    Linux

®

,

    Windows

®

and Web environments.

The Data ONTAP operating system provides the foundation to build
    a shared storage infrastructure and an enterprise-wide data
    fabric for the full breadth of business applications and data
    storage and protection requirements. Data ONTAP features
    scalability, secure multi-tenancy and unification across
    protocols and disks. Data ONTAP also unifies storage efficiency,
    data management and data protection delivery. We believe
    customers can benefit from these capabilities as they
    increasingly virtualize application environments. Our
    deduplication for primary and secondary storage, thin
    provisioning, and highly efficient hardware help maximize
    utilization while reducing data center footprint and lowering
    storage-related power and cooling consumption. A few of the
    technology features we offer with Data ONTAP include:

•

FlexShare

®

technology directs how storage system resources are used to
    deliver an appropriate level of service for each application ;

•

FlexCache

®

®

software allows partitioning of individual physical storage
    systems into multiple secure and separate logical partitions.

Storage
    Efficiency

NetApp’s portfolio of efficiency technologies helps our
    customers reduce their storage spending and get more from
    storage assets they already own. Some of the efficiency
    technologies we offer include:

•

FlexVol

®

technology provides thin provisioning through virtual volumes,
    enabling storage architectures to be more efficient and achieve
    higher utilization using flexible volumes that do not require
    repartitioning of physical storage space;

•

FlexClone

®

technology enables true data cloning using logical copies that
    do not require additional physical storage space, and allows for
    instant replication of data volumes and data sets; and

•

Deduplication

technology provides the ability to
    eliminate duplicate data within primary and secondary disk
    storage environments, resulting in greater efficiency and higher
    utilization of storage capacity.



Storage
    Management and Application Integration Software

Our management software family of products provides a broad
    range of storage and data management tools to simplify IT
    administration and enhance flexibility and productivity. We
    deliver differentiated products and collaborate with industry
    open standards and interfaces to deliver this value to
    customers. We have four suites of products targeted to different
    IT administrative roles: Storage Suite, Server Suite, Database
    Suite and Application Suite. The software products within these
    suites are tightly integrated with database and business
    application software from partners such as Microsoft, Oracle,
    SAP and VMware, in order to optimize the performance of those
    applications on our storage systems. Our product offering
    extends into data center automation, which provides the
    capability to monitor service levels, manage performance and
    support change management in complex enterprise SAN
    environments. We help customers optimize shared infrastructures
    by supporting individual application performance, service level
    and security needs even while the storage is shared across
    multiple applications.

FAS Storage
    Systems Family

Our family of modular, scalable, highly available, unified
    networked storage systems provides access to a full range of
    enterprise data for users on a variety of platforms. The
    FAS 6000, FAS 3000, and the FAS 2000 series of
    fabric-attached enterprise storage systems are designed to
    consolidate UNIX, Windows, NAS, iSCSI, SAN and Web data in
    central locations running over standard connection types:
    Gigabit Ethernet, FC and parallel SCSI (for backup). Our design
    optimizes and consolidates high-performance data access for
    individuals in multi-user environments as well as for
    application servers and server clusters with dedicated access.
    All of our FAS systems are interoperable and run the highly
    efficient Data ONTAP operating system.

V-Series Family

Our V-Series is a network-based virtualization solution that
    consolidates storage from different suppliers behind our data
    management interface, providing SAN, iSCSI and NAS access to the
    data stored in heterogeneous storage arrays. With the V-Series
    solution, customers are able to: transform existing
    heterogeneous, multi-vendor storage systems into a single
    storage pool; simplify storage provisioning and management with
    Data ONTAP thin provisioning; and dramatically lower backup

    intensive workloads such as file services and messaging. These
    intelligent read caches speed access to user data, reducing
    latency by a factor of 10 or more compared to disk drives.
    Faster response times can translate into higher throughput for
    random I/O workloads. NetApp Flash Cache and PAM give users
    performance that is comparable to that of solid state disks
    (SSDs) without the complexity of another storage tier.

Storage
    Security Products

Our DataFort storage security appliance provides a unified
    platform for data security and key management across NAS, IP
    SAN, and tape backup environments. The platform combines
    wire-speed encryption, access controls, authentication and
    automated key management to provide strong security for data at
    rest, while still allowing the capability to search compliant
    data for legal discovery purposes if the need arises. NetApp has
    partnered with Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. to provide
    advanced fabric services for SANs. These high-speed, highly
    reliable hardware devices deliver fabric-based encryption
    services to secure data assets either selectively or
    comprehensively.

    storage infrastructure to ensure the successful, ongoing
    operation of their businesses. NetApp’s services are
    designed with this in mind. We provide professional services,
    global support solutions and customer education and training to
    help customers most effectively manage their data. The
    professional services and support solutions we offer help our
    customers to resolve business problems, reduce costs, keep
    businesses up and running continuously, comply with regulations
    and policies and improve overall operational results. We utilize
    a global, integrated model to provide consistent service
    delivery and global support during every phase of the customer
    engagement, including assessment and analysis, planning, design,
    installation, implementation, integration, optimization, ongoing
    support and remote management and monitoring. Services and
    support often involve phased rollouts, technology transitions
    and migrations and other long-term engagements.

Sales,
    Principal Markets and Distribution Channels

We market and sell our products in numerous countries throughout
    the world and we continue to make investments in our multi-year
    branding and awareness campaign to increase visibility of NetApp
    in the broader IT segment.

Our diversified customer base spans a number of customer
    segments and vertical markets, including energy, financial
    services, government, high technology, internet, life sciences
    and healthcare services, major manufacturing, media,
    entertainment, animation and video postproduction and
    telecommunications. We focus primarily on the data management
    and storage markets, offering an array of solutions from our
    high-end products designed for large enterprise customers to
    entry-level products designed for mid-sized enterprise customers.

Our solutions are positioned to address the emerging
    opportunities presented by cloud computing. Our unified storage
    architecture, secure multi-tenancy capability, scalable systems,
    efficiency technologies and data management software
    functionality provide a powerful combination both for
    enterprises wanting to develop internal private clouds, and for
    service providers who want to build IT, Software, Storage and
    Infrastructure as a Service offerings.

As of the end of fiscal 2010, our worldwide sales and marketing
    function consisted of managers, sales representatives, and
    technical support personnel. We have field sales offices in more
    than 45 countries. We employ a multi-channel distribution
    strategy, selling products and services to end users and service
    providers through a direct sales force and through channel
    partners, including value-added resellers, system integrators,
    original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and distributors. During
    fiscal year 2010, sales through our indirect channels
    represented 69% of our total revenues. Sales to customers Arrow
    and Avnet, who are distributors, accounted for approximately 14%
    and 11% of our net revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2010 and
    for approximately 11% and 10% of our net revenues, respectively,
    for fiscal 2009. No individual customer accounted for ten
    percent or more of our net



revenues during fiscal 2008. Information about our segment
    disclosures, foreign operations and net sales attributable to
    our geographic regions is included in Note 16 of the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Seasonality

We have historically experienced a decline in revenues in the
    first quarter of our fiscal year, as the sales organization
    spends time developing new business after higher close rates in
    the fourth quarter, and because sales to European customers are
    historically weaker during the summer months. During the second
    quarter of our fiscal year, we have historically experienced
    increased sales, driven by the government sector, concurrent
    with the end of the U.S. federal government’s fiscal
    year in September, as well as an increase in business from
    European markets. We derive a majority of our revenue in any
    given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter. Bookings
    and revenues typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns
    weighted toward the back end of the quarter.

Backlog

We manufacture products based on a combination of specific order
    requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand. Orders
    are generally placed by customers on an as-needed basis. A
    substantial portion of our products are sold on the basis of
    standard purchase orders that are cancellable prior to shipment
    without penalty. In certain circumstances, purchase orders are
    subject to change with respect to quantity of product or timing
    of delivery resulting from changes in customer requirements. Our
    business is characterized by seasonal and intra-quarter
    variability in demand, as well as short lead-times and product
    delivery schedules. Accordingly, backlog at any given time may
    not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue.

Manufacturing
    and Supply Chain

We have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties
    located in Memphis, Tennessee; Livingston, Scotland; Schiphol
    Airport, The Netherlands; Shanghai, China; and Singapore. These
    operations include materials procurement, commodity management,
    component engineering, test engineering, manufacturing
    engineering, product assembly, product assurance, quality
    control, final test, and global logistics. We rely on a limited
    number of suppliers for materials, as well as several key
    subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and
    finished systems. We multi-source wherever possible to mitigate
    supply risk. Our strategy has been to develop close
    relationships with our suppliers, exchanging critical
    information and implementing joint quality programs. We also use
    contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies
    to improve our manufacturing redundancy. This manufacturing
    strategy minimizes capital investments and overhead expenditures
    and creates flexibility for rapid expansion.

We were awarded ISO 9001 certification on May 29, 1997 and
    continue to be ISO 9001 certified. We were awarded ISO 14001
    certification on December 8, 2004 and continue to be ISO
    14001 certified.

Research
    and Development

We conduct research and development activities in various
    locations throughout the world. In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    research and development expenses represented 14%, 15% and 14%
    of our net revenues, respectively. These costs relate primarily
    to personnel and related costs incurred to conduct product
    development activities. Although we develop many of our products
    internally, we may acquire technology through business
    combinations or through licensing from third parties when
    appropriate. We believe that technical leadership is essential
    to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial
    resources to research and development.

Competition

We compete with many companies in the markets we serve,
    including companies that offer a broad spectrum of IT products
    and services and others that offer specific storage and data
    management products or services. In the storage market, our
    primary system products and our associated software portfolio
    compete primarily with storage system products and data
    management software from EMC, Hitachi Data Systems, HP, IBM, and
    Oracle Corporation, through its acquisition of Sun Microsystems.
    In addition, Dell, Inc. is a competitor in the storage
    marketplace through its business arrangement with EMC, which
    allows Dell to resell EMC storage hardware and



software products, as well as through Dell’s acquisition of
    EqualLogic, through which Dell offers low-priced storage
    solutions. In the secondary storage market, which includes the

disk-to-disk

backup, compliance and business continuity segments, our
    solutions compete primarily against products from EMC and Oracle
    Corporation, through its acquisition of Sun Microsystems.

We believe that most of these companies compete based on their
    market presence, products, service or price. Some of these
    companies also compete by offering storage and data management
    products or services together with other IT products or
    services, at minimal or no additional cost in order to preserve
    or gain market share.

We believe that we have a number of competitive advantages over
    many of these companies, including product innovation and the
    relationships we have with our customers and partners. We
    believe the advantages of our products include functionality,
    scalability, performance, quality and operational efficiency. We
    believe we have an advantage in the nature of the relationships
    we form with our customers and partners worldwide. We strive to
    deliver an outstanding experience in every interaction we have
    with our customers and partners through our product, service and
    support offerings that enable us to provide our customers with a
    full range of expertise before, during and after their purchase
    from us or from one of our partners.

An increase in industry consolidation may result in stronger
    competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source
    vendors for customers. In addition, current and potential
    competitors have established or may establish cooperative
    relationships among themselves or with third parties, including
    some of our partners. It is possible that new competitors or
    alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire
    significant market share.

Proprietary
    Rights

We currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark
    laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual
    provisions, and patents to protect our proprietary rights. We
    seek to protect our software, documentation, and other written
    materials under trade secret, copyright, and patent laws, which
    afford only limited protection. We have registered our NetApp

    and others as trademarks in the United States. Other
    U.S. trademarks and U.S. registered trademarks are
    registered internationally as well. We will continue to evaluate
    the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate. We
    generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our
    employees, resellers, customers, and suppliers. We currently
    have multiple U.S. and international patent applications
    pending and multiple U.S. patents issued.

In addition, through various licensing arrangements, we receive
    certain rights to intellectual property of others. We expect to
    maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing
    arrangements in the future, as needed and to the extent
    available on reasonable terms and conditions, to support
    continued development and sales of our products and services.
    Some of these licensing arrangements require or may require
    royalty payments and other licensing fees. The amount of these
    payments and fees may depend on various factors, including but
    not limited to: the structure of royalty payments, offsetting
    considerations, if any, and the degree of use of the licensed
    technology.

The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly
    changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent
    claims and related litigation regarding patent and other
    intellectual property rights, and we are exposed to various
    risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of
    intellectual property rights. If we are unable to protect our
    intellectual property, we may be subject to increased
    competition that could materially and adversely affect our
    operating results.

Environmental
    Disclosure

We seek to comply with all applicable statutory and
    administrative requirements concerning environmental quality and
    worker health and safety. We have made, and will continue to
    make, expenditures for environmental compliance and protection.
    Such expenditures have not had, and are not expected to have, a
    material effect on our capital expenditures, results of
    operations or competitive position.

We are voluntarily assessing our greenhouse gas emissions, and
    have begun to take action to reduce such emissions, for example
    through establishing employee commuter programs and evaluating
    the energy efficiency of



our buildings. Various laws and regulations have been
    implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects
    of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions.
    Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have
    tended to become more stringent over time. It is often difficult
    to estimate the future impact of environmental matters. Based on
    current information and subject to the finalization of the
    proposed regulations, we believe that our primary risk related
    to climate change is the risk of increased energy costs.
    However, because we are not an energy intensive business, we do
    not anticipate being subject to a cap and trade system or any
    other mitigation measures that would be material to our
    operations.

We are also subject to other federal, state and local
    regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the
    environment. Various international, federal, state and local
    provisions regulate the use and discharge of certain hazardous
    materials used in the manufacture of our products. Failure to
    comply with environmental regulations in the future could cause
    us to incur substantial costs or subject us to business
    interruptions. We believe we are substantially compliant with
    all applicable environmental laws. All of our products meet the
    requirements for WEEE, RoHS and China RoHS compliance. We have
    maintained an Environmental Management System since December
    2004 as well as our ISO 14001 certification. As part of ISO
    14001 requirements, we conduct an annual review of our
    operations and we monitor environmental legislation and
    requirements to help ensure we are taking necessary measures to
    remain in compliance with applicable laws.

Working
    Capital Practices

Information about our working capital practices is included in
    Item 7 — “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation”
    under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources”
    and is incorporated herein by reference.

Employees

As of April 30, 2010, we had 8,333 employees, of
    which, 2,346 were in research and development, 3,912 were in
    sales and marketing, 1,215 were in services and manufacturing
    operations, and 860 were in finance and administration. We have
    never had a work stoppage and consider relations with our
    employees to be good. Competition for technical personnel in the
    industry in which we compete is intense. We believe that our
    future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire,
    assimilate, and retain qualified personnel. To date, we believe
    that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees,
    but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful
    in the future.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

The following risk factors and other information included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties
    described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks
    and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently
    deem less significant may also impair our business operations.
    Please see page 3 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional discussion of these



forward-looking

statements. If any of the events or circumstances described in
    the following risk factors actually occurs, our business,
    operating results, and financial condition could be materially
    adversely affected.

Our
    operating results may be adversely affected by uncertain
    economic and market conditions.

We are subject to the effects of general global economic and
    market conditions. Challenging economic conditions worldwide
    have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in the computer,
    storage, and networking industries at large, as well as the
    information technology (“IT”) market, resulting in:

•

Reduced demand for our products as a result of constraints on IT
    related spending by our customers;

•

Increased price competition for our products from competitors;

•

Deferment of purchases and orders by customers due to budgetary
    constraints or changes in current or planned utilization of our
    systems;

•

Risk of excess and obsolete inventories;

•

Risk of supply constraints:

•

Excess facilities costs;

•

Higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenues;

•

Negative impacts from increased financial pressures on
    customers, distributors and resellers;

•

Negative impacts from increased financial pressures on key
    suppliers or contract manufacturers; and

•

Potential discontinuance of product lines or businesses and
    related asset impairments.

Any of the above mentioned factors could have a material and
    adverse effect on our business and financial performance.

Our
    quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which could adversely
    impact our common stock price.

We believe that

period-to-period

comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily
    meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future
    performance. Our operating results have in the past, and will
    continue to be, subject to quarterly fluctuations as a result of
    numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more
    pronounced fluctuations during times of economic volatility.
    These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

Fluctuations in demand for our products and services, in part
    due to changes in general economic conditions and specific
    economic conditions in the storage and data management market;

•

A shift in federal government spending patterns;

•

Changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and
    reduced visibility into our customers’ spending plans and
    associated revenues;

•

The level of price and product competition in our target product
    markets;

•

The impact of economic uncertainty on our customers’
    budgets and IT spending capacity;

•

Our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and
    purchase commitments;

•

Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers, and industry
    consolidation in our supply base, which could subject us to
    periodic

supply-and-demand,

price rigidity, and quality issues with our components;

•

The timing of bookings, the cancellation of significant orders
    and the management of our backlog;

•

Product configuration and mix;

•

The extent to which our customers renew their service and
    maintenance contracts with us;



•

Seasonality, such as our historical seasonal decline in revenues
    in the first quarter of our fiscal year and seasonal increase in
    revenues in the second quarter of our fiscal year, with the
    latter due in part to the impact of the U.S. federal
    government’s September 30 fiscal year end on the timing of
    its orders;

•

Linearity, such as our historical intraquarter bookings and
    revenue pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each
    quarter’s total bookings and related revenue occur in the
    last month of the quarter;

•

Announcements and introductions of, and transitions to, new
    products by us or our competitors;

•

Deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or
    product enhancements introduced by us or our competitors;

•

Our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products and
    enhancements in a timely manner;

•

Our levels of expenditure on research and development and sales
    and marketing programs;

•

Our ability to effectively manage our operating expenses;

•

Adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates in the
    countries in which we do business;

•

The dilutive impact of our $1.265 billion of 1.75%
    convertible senior notes due June 2013 (the “Notes”)
    and related warrants on our earnings per share;

•

Excess or inadequate facilities;

•

Actual events, circumstances, outcomes and amounts differing
    from judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in determining
    the values of certain assets (including the amounts of valuation
    allowances), liabilities, and other items reflected in our
    consolidated financial statements;

•

Disruptions resulting from new systems and processes as we
    continue to enhance and scale our system infrastructure; and

•

Future accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting
    rules, such as the increased use of fair value measures, changes
    in accounting standards related to revenue recognition, and the
    potential requirement that U.S. registrants prepare
    financial statements in accordance with International Financial
    Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Due to such factors, operating results for a future period are
    difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not
    necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future
    periods. Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors
    discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect
    on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
    It is possible that in one or more quarters our results may fall
    below our forecasts and the expectations of public market
    analysts and investors. In such event, the trading price of our
    common stock would likely decrease.

Our
    revenue for a particular period is difficult to forecast, and a
    shortfall in revenue may harm our business and our operating
    results.

Our revenues for a particular period are difficult to forecast,
    especially in times of economic uncertainty. Our revenues are
    also difficult to forecast because the storage and data
    management market is rapidly evolving, and our sales cycle
    varies substantially from customer to customer. New or
    additional product introductions also increase the complexities
    of forecasting revenues.

We derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from
    orders booked in the same quarter. Bookings typically follow
    intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end
    of the quarter. If we do not achieve bookings in the latter part
    of a quarter consistent with our quarterly targets, our
    financial results will be adversely impacted. Additionally, due
    to the complexities associated with revenue recognition, we may
    not accurately forecast our non-deferred and deferred revenues,
    which could adversely impact our results of operations.

We use a “pipeline” system, a common industry
    practice, to forecast bookings and trends in our business. Sales
    personnel monitor the status of potential business and estimate
    when a customer will make a purchase decision, the dollar amount
    of the sale and the products or services to be sold. These
    estimates are aggregated periodically to



generate a bookings pipeline. Our pipeline estimates may prove
    to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer
    period of time, in part because the “conversion rate”
    of the pipeline into revenues varies from customer to customer,
    can be difficult to estimate, and requires management judgment,
    and also because customers’ purchasing decisions are
    subject to delay, reduction or cancellation. Small deviations
    from our forecasted conversion rate may result in inaccurate
    plans and budgets and could materially and adversely impact our
    business or our planned results of operations.

Economic uncertainties have caused, and may in the future again
    cause, consumers, businesses and governments to defer purchases
    in response to tighter budgets, credit, decreased cash
    availability and declining customer confidence. Accordingly,
    future demand for our products could differ from our current
    expectations.

We
    have experienced periods of alternating growth and decline in
    revenues and operating expenses. If we are not able to
    successfully manage these fluctuations, our business, financial
    condition and results of operations could be significantly
    impacted.

Changing market conditions and economic uncertainty create a
    challenging operating environment for our business. It is
    critical that we maintain appropriate alignment between our cost
    structure and our expected growth and revenues, while at the
    same time, continue to make strategic investments for future
    growth.

Our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to
    future revenues, and a significant percentage of our expenses
    are fixed. We have a limited ability to quickly or significantly
    reduce our fixed costs, and if revenue levels are below our
    expectations, operating results will be adversely impacted.
    During periods of uneven growth, we may incur costs before we
    realize the anticipated related benefits, which could harm our
    operating results. We have made, and will continue to make,
    significant investments in engineering, sales, service and
    support, marketing programs and other functions to support and
    grow our business. We are likely to recognize the costs
    associated with these investments earlier than some of the
    related anticipated benefits (revenue growth), and the return on
    these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than
    we expect, which could harm our business, operating results and
    financial condition.

Conversely, if we are unable to effectively manage our resources
    and capacity during periods of increasing demand for our
    products, we could also experience an adverse impact to our
    business, operating results and financial condition. If the
    storage and data management market fails to grow, or grows
    slower than we expect, our revenues will be adversely affected.
    Also, even if IT spending increases, our revenues may not grow
    at the same pace.

Our
    gross margins have varied over time and may continue to vary,
    and such variation may make it more difficult to forecast our
    earnings.

Our total gross margins are impacted by the mix of product,
    software entitlements and maintenance and services revenues.

Our product gross margins have been and may continue to be
    affected by a variety of factors, including:

•

Demand for storage and data management products;

•

Pricing actions, rebates, sales initiatives, discount levels,
    and price competition;

•

Direct versus indirect and OEM sales;

•

Changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including mix
    of configurations within products;

•

The mix of sales to commercial and U.S. government sector
    end users;

•

The timing and amount of revenue recognized and deferred;

•

New product introductions and enhancements;

•

Licensing and royalty arrangements;



•

Excess inventory levels or purchase commitments as a result of
    changes in demand forecasts or last time buy purchases;

•

Possible product and software defects as we transition our
    products; and

•

The cost of components, contract manufacturing costs, quality,
    warranty, and freight.

Changes in software entitlements and maintenance gross margins
    may result from various factors, such as:

•

The size of the installed base of products under support
    contracts;

•

The timing of technical support service contract renewals;

•

Demand for and the timing of delivery of upgrades; and

•

The level of spending on our customer support infrastructure.

Changes in service gross margins may result from various
    factors, such as:

•

The mix of customers;

•

The size and timing of service contract renewals;

•

Spares stocking requirements to support new product
    introductions;

•

The volume, cost and use of outside partners to deliver support
    services on our behalf; and

•

Product quality and serviceability issues.

Due to such factors, gross margins are subject to variations
    from period to period and are difficult to predict.

An
    increase in competition and industry consolidation could
    materially and adversely affect our operating
    results.

The storage and data management markets are intensely
    competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing
    technology. In the storage market, our primary and near-line
    storage system products and our associated software portfolio
    compete primarily with storage system products and data
    management software from EMC, Hitachi Data Systems, HP, IBM, and
    Oracle Corporation, through its acquisition of Sun Microsystems.
    In addition, Dell, Inc. is a competitor in the storage
    marketplace through its business arrangement with EMC, which
    allows Dell to resell EMC storage hardware and software
    products, as well as through Dell’s acquisition of
    EqualLogic, through which Dell offers low-priced storage
    solutions. In the secondary storage market, which includes the

disk-to-disk

backup, compliance and business continuity segments, our
    solutions compete primarily against products from EMC and Oracle
    Corporation, through its acquisition of Sun Microsystems.

There has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our
    markets for several years. For example, in January 2010, Oracle
    Corporation, one of our strategic partners, completed its
    acquisition of Sun Microsystems, one of our competitors; in
    addition, in July 2009, EMC, one of our competitors, acquired
    Data Domain. We expect this trend to continue as companies
    attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an
    evolving industry and as companies become unable to maintain
    their competitive positions or continue operations. We believe
    that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors
    that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for
    customers. In addition, current and potential competitors have
    established or may establish strategic alliances among
    themselves or with third parties, including some of our
    partners. For example, in November 2009, Cisco and EMC together
    with VMware announced a Virtual Computing Environment coalition.
    It is possible that new competitors or alliances among
    competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market
    share. We may not be able to compete successfully against
    current or future competitors. Competitive pressures we face
    could materially and adversely affect our business and operating
    results.



Disruption
    of or changes in our distribution model could harm our
    sales.

If we fail to develop and maintain strong relationships with our
    distributors, or if our distributors fail to effectively manage
    the sale of our products or services on our behalf, our revenues
    and gross margins could be adversely affected.

We market and sell our storage data management solutions
    directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly
    through channel partners such as value-added resellers, systems
    integrators, distributors, OEMs and strategic business partners,
    and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from these
    indirect channels. During fiscal 2010, revenues generated from
    sales from our indirect channel distribution accounted for 69%
    of our revenues. In order for us to maintain or increase our
    revenues, we must effectively manage our relationships with
    channel partners.

Several factors could result in disruption of or changes in our
    indirect channel distribution model, which could materially harm
    our revenues and gross margins, including the following:

•

Our indirect channel partners may compete directly with other
    channel partners or with our direct sales force. Due to these
    conflicts, our indirect channel partners could stop or reduce
    their efforts in marketing our products.

•

Our indirect channel partners may demand that we absorb a
    greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to
    bear;

•

Our indirect channel partners may have insufficient financial
    resources and may not be able to withstand changes and
    challenges in business conditions; and

•

Our indirect channel partners’ financial condition or
    operations may weaken.

There is no assurance that we will be able to attract new
    indirect channel partners, retain these indirect channel
    partners or that we will be able to secure additional or
    replacement indirect channel partners in the future, especially
    in light of changes in end customer demand patterns and changes
    in available and competing technologies from competitors. The
    loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a
    given geographic area could harm our operating results within
    that area, as qualifying and developing new indirect channel
    partners typically requires a significant investment of time and
    resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met. Our
    inability to effectively establish, train, retain and manage our
    distribution channel could harm our sales.

In addition, we depend on our indirect channel partners to
    comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the
    jurisdictions in which they operate. Their failure to do so
    could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and
    operating results.

Our
    OEM relationship may not continue to generate significant
    revenues.

In April 2005, we entered into an OEM agreement with IBM, which
    enables IBM to sell IBM branded solutions based on NetApp
    unified solutions, including
    NearStore

®

and V-Series systems, as well as associated software offerings.
    While this agreement is an element of our strategy to expand our
    reach into more customers and countries, we do not have an
    exclusive relationship with IBM, and there is no minimum
    commitment for any given period of time; therefore, this
    relationship may not continue to generate significant revenues.
    In addition, we have no control over the products that IBM
    selects to sell, or its release schedule and timing of those
    products; nor do we control its pricing.

In the event that sales through our OEM relationship increase,
    we may experience distribution channel conflicts between our
    direct sales force and the OEM or among our channel partners. If
    we fail to minimize channel conflicts, or if our OEM
    relationship does not continue to generate significant revenues,
    our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.



A
    portion of our revenues is generated by large, recurring
    purchases from various customers, resellers and distributors. A
    loss, cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties
    has and in the future could negatively affect our
    revenues.

During fiscal 2010, sales to distributors Arrow and Avnet
    accounted for approximately 14% and 11%, respectively of our net
    revenues. The loss of orders from these, or any of our more
    significant customers, strategic partners, distributors or
    resellers could cause our revenues and profitability to suffer.
    Our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of
    factors, including the cost-effectiveness, reliability,
    scalability and comprehensiveness of our product offerings, and
    our ability to address customer demands.

We also have an agreement with Fujitsu Technology Solutions
    (“Fujitsu”), which enables Fujitsu to lease, sell,
    market and resell NetApp products to end users and Fujitsu sales
    partners worldwide and to integrate NetApp products into Fujitsu
    bundled offerings, as well as to market NetApp’s support
    services.

We generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with
    our customers for an extended period of time, and thus we may
    not be able to continue to receive large, recurring orders from
    these customers, resellers or distributors. For example, our
    reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases
    and our customers, resellers and distributors can stop
    purchasing and marketing our products at any time.

Unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact our
    operations by affecting the solvency of our customers, resellers
    and distributors, or the ability of our customers to obtain
    credit to finance purchases of our products. If the uncertainty
    in the economy continues, or conditions deteriorate, and our
    sales decline, our financial condition and operating results
    could be adversely impacted.

Because our expenses are based on our revenue forecasts, a
    substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to, or
    unexpected returns from customers and resellers, or the loss of
    any significant customer or reseller, could harm our business.
    We expect that our largest customers in the future could be
    different from our largest customers today. End users could stop
    purchasing and indirect channel partners could stop marketing
    our products at any time. The loss of one or more of our key
    indirect channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a
    number of large orders each quarter could harm our operating
    results. In addition, a change in the pricing practices of one
    or more of our large customers could adversely affect our
    revenues and gross margins.

The
    U.S. government has contributed to our revenue growth and has
    become an important customer for us. Future revenue from the
    U.S. government is subject to shifts in government spending
    patterns. A decrease in government demand for our products could
    materially affect our revenues. In addition, our business could
    be adversely affected as a result of future examinations by the
    U.S. government.

The U.S. government has become an important customer for
    the storage and data management market and for us; however,
    government demand is unpredictable, and there can be no
    assurance that we will maintain or grow our revenues from the
    U.S. government. Government agencies are subject to
    budgetary processes and expenditure constraints that could lead
    to delays or decreased capital expenditures in IT spending. If
    the government or individual agencies within the government
    reduce or shift their capital spending patterns, our revenues
    and operating results may be harmed.

In addition, selling our products to the U.S. government
    also subjects us to certain regulatory requirements. For
    example, in April 2009, we entered into a settlement agreement
    with the United States of America, acting through the United
    States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and on behalf of
    the General Services Administration (the “GSA”), under
    which we paid the United States $128.0 million, plus interest of
    $0.7 million, related to a dispute regarding our discount
    practices and compliance with the price reduction clause
    provisions of GSA contracts between August 1997 and February
    2005. The failure to comply with U.S. government regulatory
    requirements could subject us to fines and other penalties,
    which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues,
    operating results and financial position.

If we
    are unable to maintain our existing relationships and develop
    new relationships with major strategic partners, our revenues
    may be impacted negatively.

An element of our strategy to increase revenues is to
    strategically partner with major third-party software and
    hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products
    and also co-market our products with the vendors. We have
    significant partner relationships with database, business
    application, backup management and server



virtualization companies, including Microsoft, Oracle, SAP,
    Symantec and VMware. In addition, in November 2009, we announced
    our intention to expand our relationship with Fujitsu, and in
    January 2010, we announced an expansion of our collaboration
    with Cisco and VMware, including a cooperative support
    arrangement. A number of these strategic partners are industry
    leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage
    and data management market. There is intense competition for
    attractive strategic partners, and even if we can establish
    relationships with these or other partners, these partnerships
    may not generate significant revenues or may not continue to be
    in effect for any specific period of time. If these
    relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could
    experience lower than expected revenue growth, suffer delays in
    product development, or other operational difficulties.

In addition, some of our partners, including Oracle, Cisco and
    VMware, are also partnering with other storage vendors which may
    increase the availability of competing solutions, harm our
    ability to continue as the vendor of choice for those partners
    and harm our ability to grow our business with those partners.

We intend to continue to establish and maintain business
    relationships with technology companies to expand our marketing
    reach and accelerate the development of our storage and data
    management solutions. To the extent that we are unsuccessful in
    developing new relationships or maintaining our existing
    relationships, our future revenues and operating results could
    be impacted negatively. In addition, the loss of a strategic
    partner could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and
    operating results.

Our
    future financial performance depends on growth in the storage
    and data management markets. If the performance of these markets
    does not meet the expectations upon which we calculate and
    forecast our revenues, our operating results will be materially
    and adversely impacted.

All of our products address the storage and data management
    markets. Accordingly, our future financial performance will
    depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and data
    management markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging
    standards in these markets. The markets for storage and data
    management have been recently adversely impacted by the global
    economic uncertainty, and as a result of continued uncertainty,
    the markets may not grow as anticipated or may decline.

Additionally, emerging standards in these markets may adversely
    affect the
    UNIX

®

,

    Windows

®

and the World Wide Web server markets upon which we depend. For
    example, we provide our open access data retention solutions to
    customers within the financial services, healthcare,
    pharmaceutical and government market segments, industries that
    are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with
    respect to data access, reliability and permanence (such as
    Rule 17(a)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended) in the United States and in the other countries in
    which we operate. If our products do not meet and continue to
    comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this
    regard, customers in these market and geographical segments will
    not purchase our products, and we will not be able to expand our
    product offerings in these market and geographical segments at
    the rates which we have forecasted.

Supply
    chain issues, including financial problems of contract
    manufacturers or component suppliers, or a shortage of adequate
    component supply or manufacturing capacity that increases our
    costs or causes a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, could
    have a material adverse impact on our business and operating
    results, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly
    may result in excess or obsolete component supply, which could
    adversely affect our gross margins.

The fact that we do not own or operate our manufacturing
    facilities and supply chain exposes us to risks, including
    reduced control over quality assurance, production costs and
    product supply, which could have a material adverse impact on
    the supply of our products and on our business and operating
    results. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for components
    utilized in the assembly of our products, which has and could
    subject us to future periodic supply constraints and price
    rigidity.

Financial problems of either contract manufacturers, component
    suppliers or other parties in our supply chain and reservation
    of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other
    companies, inside or outside of our industry, could either limit
    supply or increase costs of our products. Qualifying a new
    contract manufacturer and



commencing volume production is expensive and time-consuming,
    and disruption or termination of manufacturing capacity from any
    contract manufacturer could negatively impact our ability to
    manufacture and sell our products.

We intend to regularly introduce new products and product
    enhancements, which will require us to rapidly achieve volume
    production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and
    suppliers. A reduction or interruption in supply; a significant
    increase in the price of one or more components; a failure to
    adequately procure inventory by our contract manufacturers; a
    failure to appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our
    requirements based on our business needs; or a decrease in
    demand for our products could materially adversely affect our
    business, operating results, and financial condition and could
    materially damage customer relationships. Furthermore, as a
    result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers,
    we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are
    higher than those available in the current market. In the event
    that we become committed to purchase components at prices in
    excess of the current market price when the components are
    actually used, our gross margins could decrease. As the demand
    for our products has increased, we have experienced, and may
    continue to experience tightening of supply of some components
    leading to longer lead times and component supply constraints,
    which has and in the future could continue to result in the
    delay of shipments.

We are
    exposed to the credit and non-payment risk of our customers,
    resellers, and distributors, especially during times of economic
    uncertainty and tight credit markets, which could result in
    material losses.

Most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis, with
    typical payment terms of 30 days. While we monitor
    individual customer payment capability in granting such open
    credit arrangements, and seek to limit such open credit to
    amounts we believe are reasonable, we may experience losses due
    to a customer’s inability to pay.

Beyond our open credit arrangements, we also have recourse and
    nonrecourse customer financing leasing arrangements using third
    party leasing companies. Under the terms of recourse leases,
    which are treated as off-balance sheet arrangements, we remain
    liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the
    third party leasing company in the event of end-user customer
    default. We also offer financing arrangements whereby the
    end-user customer pays a fixed monthly amount plus a variable
    amount based on actual storage capacity used. These arrangements
    subject us to additional risk around revenue recognition and
    profitability due to the uncertainties associated with the
    variable portion of the arrangements. In addition, from time to
    time we provide guarantees for a portion of other financing
    arrangements under which we could be called upon to make
    payments to our funding parties in the event of nonpayment by
    end-user customers.

We expect demand for customer financing to continue. During
    periods of economic uncertainty, our exposure to credit risks
    from our customers increases. In addition, our exposure to
    credit risks of our customers may increase further if our
    customers and their customers or their lease financing sources
    are adversely affected by global economic conditions.

In the past, there have been bankruptcies by our customers, both
    who have open credit and who have lease financing arrangements
    with us, causing us to incur bad debt charges, and, in the case
    of financing arrangements, a loss of revenues. We may be subject
    to similar losses in future periods. Any future losses could
    harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our
    operating results and financial condition. Additionally, to the
    extent that the recent turmoil in the credit markets makes it
    more difficult for customers to obtain open credit or lease
    financing, those customers’ ability to purchase our product
    could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material
    adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.

The
    market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly
    in the past and will likely continue to do so in the
    future.

The market price for our common stock has experienced
    substantial volatility in the past, and several factors could
    cause substantial fluctuation in the future. These factors
    include but are not limited to:

•

Fluctuations in our operating results compared to prior periods
    and forecasts;

•

Variations between our operating results and either the guidance
    we have furnished to the public or the published expectations of
    securities analysts;

•

Industry consolidation and the resulting perception of increased
    competition;



•

Economic developments in the storage and data management market
    as a whole;

•

Fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by
    investors to be comparable to us;

•

Changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections;

•

Changes in our relationships with our suppliers, customers,
    channel and strategic partners;

•

Announcements of the completion or dissolution of strategic
    alliances within the industry;

•

Dilutive impacts of our convertible Notes and related warrants;

•

International conflicts and acts of terrorism;

•

Announcements of new products, applications, or product
    enhancements by us or our competitors;

•

Inquiries by the SEC, NASDAQ, law enforcement, or other
    regulatory bodies; and

•

General market conditions, including recent global or regional
    economic uncertainties.

In addition, the stock market has experienced volatility that
    has particularly affected the market prices of the equity
    securities of many technology companies. Certain macroeconomic
    factors such as changes in interest rates, the market climate
    for the technology sector, and levels of corporate spending on
    IT, could continue to have an impact on the trading price of our
    stock, and the market price of our common stock may fluctuate
    significantly in the future.

Changes
    in market conditions have led, and in the future could lead, to
    charges related to the discontinuance of certain of our products
    and asset impairments.

In response to changes in economic conditions and market
    demands, we may decide to strategically realign our resources
    and consider cost containment measures including restructuring,
    disposing of, or otherwise discontinuing certain products. Any
    decision to limit investment in, dispose of, or otherwise exit
    products may result in the recording of charges to earnings,
    including inventory and technology-related or other intangible
    asset write-offs, workforce reduction costs, charges relating to
    consolidation of excess facilities, cancellation penalties or
    claims from third parties who were resellers or users of
    discontinued products, which would harm our operating results.
    Our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate
    recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including
    purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such
    assessments and decisions. Additionally, we are required to
    perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis, and
    between annual tests in certain circumstances when impairment
    indicators exist or if certain events or changes in
    circumstances have occurred. Future goodwill impairment tests
    may result in charges to earnings, which could materially harm
    our operating results.

If we
    are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to
    technological change, if our new products do not achieve market
    acceptance, if we fail to manage the interoperability and
    transition between our new and old products, or if we cannot
    provide the expected level of service and support for our new
    products, our operating results could be materially and
    adversely affected.

Our future growth depends upon the successful development and
    introduction of new hardware and software products. Due to the
    complexity of storage subsystems and storage security appliances
    and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to
    produce new products, such products are subject to significant
    technical risks. In addition, our new products must respond to
    technological changes and evolving industry standards. If we are
    unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and
    introduce new products in a timely manner in response to
    changing market conditions or customer requirements, or if such
    products do not achieve market acceptance, our operating results
    could be materially and adversely affected. New or additional
    product introductions increase the complexities of forecasting
    revenues, and subject us to additional financial and operational
    risks. If they are not managed effectively, we could experience
    material risks to our operations, financial condition and
    business model.

As new or enhanced products are introduced, we must successfully
    manage the interoperability and transition from older products
    in order to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering
    patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories,
    and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered
    to meet customers’ demands.



As we enter new or emerging markets, we will likely increase
    demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed
    to additional competition. We may not be able to provide
    products, service and support to effectively compete for these
    market opportunities.

Risks
    inherent in our international operations could have a material
    adverse effect on our business.

A substantial portion of our revenues are derived from sales
    outside of the United States. During fiscal 2010, our
    international revenues accounted for 50% of our total revenues.
    A substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside
    of the U.S., and we have research and development and service
    centers overseas. Accordingly, our business and our future
    operating results could be adversely affected by a variety of
    factors affecting our international operations, some of which
    are beyond our control, including regulatory, political, or
    economic conditions in a specific country or region, trade
    protection measures and other regulatory requirements,
    government spending patterns, and acts of terrorism and
    international conflicts. In addition, we may not be able to
    maintain or increase international market demand for our
    products.

We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency
    exchange rates as a result of our international operations.
    These exposures may change over time as business practices
    evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our
    financial results and cash flows. Our international sales are
    denominated in U.S. dollars and in foreign currencies. An
    increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to
    foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and
    therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets.
    Conversely, lowering our price in local currency may result in
    lower

U.S.-based

revenues. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar
    relative to foreign currencies could increase operating expenses
    in foreign markets. Additionally, we have exposures to emerging
    market currencies, which can experience extreme volatility. We
    utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our foreign
    currency exposure associated with certain assets and liabilities
    as well as anticipated foreign currency cash flows on a
    short-term basis. All balance sheet hedges are marked to market
    through earnings every quarter. The time-value component of our
    cash flow hedges is recorded in earnings while all other gains
    and losses are marked to market through other comprehensive
    income until forecasted transactions occur, at which time such
    realized gains and losses are recognized in earnings. These
    hedges attempt to reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate,
    the impact of currency exchange movements. Factors that could
    have a negative impact on the effectiveness of our hedging
    program include inaccuracies in forecasting, widening interest
    rate differentials, and volatility in the foreign exchange
    market. Our hedging strategies may not be successful and
    currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material
    adverse effect on our operating results.

Certain United States Government export restrictions impede our
    ability to sell to certain end users certain of our products.
    The United States, through the Bureau of Industry Security,
    places restrictions on the export of certain encryption
    technology. These restrictions may include: the requirement to
    have a license to export the technology; the requirement to have
    software licenses approved before export is allowed; and
    outright bans on the licensing of certain encryption technology
    to particular end users or to all end users in a particular
    country. Certain of our products are subject to various levels
    of export restrictions. These export restrictions could
    negatively impact our business. Our international operations are
    subject to other risks, including general import/export
    restrictions, regulations related to data privacy, and other
    complex rules and regulations under which we must conduct
    business in foreign countries. We are also subject to the
    potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy,
    misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our
    intellectual property rights than U.S. law. Such factors
    could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results
    and financial position.

Additional risks inherent in our international business
    activities generally include, among others, longer accounts
    receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing
    international operations.

Moreover, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with
    developing economies, it is common to engage in business
    practices that are prohibited by regulations applicable to us,
    such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we implement
    policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these
    laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those
    companies to which we outsource certain of our business
    operations, may take actions in violation of these policies. Any
    such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties,
    which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition or results of operations.



Changes
    in our effective tax rate or adverse outcomes resulting from
    examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our
    results.

Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several
    factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:

•

Earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are
    taxed at lower rates as compared to the U.S. statutory tax
    rate;

•

Material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates as
    a result of a shift in the mix of pretax profits and losses by
    tax jurisdiction, our ability to use tax credits, or effective
    tax rates by tax jurisdiction that differ from our estimates;

•

Changing tax laws or related interpretations, accounting
    standards, regulations, and interpretations in multiple tax
    jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as the requirements
    of certain tax rulings;

•

An increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes,
    including certain stock-based compensation expense, write-offs
    of acquired in-process research and development, and impairment
    of goodwill;

•

The tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and
    restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between
    reporting periods;

•

Changes related to our ability to ultimately realize future
    benefits attributed to our deferred tax assets, including those
    related to

other-than-temporary

impairments;

•

Tax assessments resulting from income tax audits or any related
    tax interest or penalties could significantly affect our income
    tax provision for the period in which the settlements take
    place; and

•

A change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign
    earnings.

We receive significant tax benefits from sales to our

non-U.S. customers.

These benefits are contingent upon existing tax regulations in
    the United States and in the countries in which our
    international operations are located. Future changes in domestic
    or international tax regulations could adversely affect our
    ability to continue to realize these tax benefits. We have not
    provided for United States federal and state income taxes or
    foreign withholding taxes that may result on future remittances
    of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Obama
    administration has announced several proposals to reform United
    States tax rules, including proposals that may result in a
    reduction or elimination of the deferral of United States income
    tax on our future unrepatriated earnings. Should such
    anti-deferral provisions be enacted, our effective tax rate
    could be adversely affected.

We are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the
    United States and several foreign tax jurisdictions. The rights
    to some of our intellectual property (“IP”) are owned
    by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made
    between U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the
    use of this IP in a qualified cost sharing arrangement. In
    recent years, several other U.S. companies have had their
    foreign IP arrangements challenged as part of IRS examinations,
    which has resulted in material proposed assessments

and/or

litigation with respect to those companies.

During fiscal year 2009, we received Notices of Proposed
    Adjustments from the IRS in connection with a federal income tax
    audit of our fiscal 2003 and 2004 tax returns. We filed a
    protest with the IRS in response to the Notices of Proposed
    Adjustments and subsequently received a rebuttal from the IRS
    examination team in response to our protest. We recently were
    informed by the IRS that this audit will proceed to the IRS
    Appeals level for further administrative review. The Notices of
    Proposed Adjustments in this audit focus primarily on issues of
    the timing and the amount of income recognized and deductions
    taken during the audit years and on the level of cost
    allocations made to foreign operations during the audit years.

The IRS recently commenced the examination of our fiscal 2005
    through 2007 federal income tax returns, and in addition, the
    California Franchise Tax Board has notified us of their intent
    to examine our fiscal 2007 and 2008 California tax returns. The
    scope of the IRS and California Franchise Tax Board examinations
    are unclear at this time.

If the ultimate determination of income taxes assessed under the
    current IRS audits or under audits being conducted in any of the
    other tax jurisdictions in which we operate results in an amount
    in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for,
    our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could
    be adversely affected.



Our international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling
    concluded in the Netherlands which expires on April 30,
    2015 and results in a lower level of earnings subject to tax in
    the Netherlands. If we are unable to negotiate a similar tax
    ruling upon expiration of the current ruling, our effective tax
    rate could increase and our operating results could be adversely
    affected. Our effective tax rate could also be adversely
    affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing
    law or regulations, which in turn would negatively impact our
    operating and financial results as a whole. Our effective tax
    rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in
    international operations and how the operations are managed and
    structured. The price of our common stock could decline to the
    extent that our financial results are materially affected by an
    adverse change in our effective tax rate.

Our
    leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our
    financial condition, results of operations and our earnings per
    share.

As a result of the sale of our Notes, we have a greater amount
    of long-term debt than we have maintained in the past. In
    addition, we have various synthetic lease arrangements related
    to some of our facilities at our corporate headquarters in
    Sunnyvale, California, and, subject to the restrictions in our
    existing and any future financing agreements, we may incur
    additional debt. Our maintenance of higher levels of
    indebtedness could have adverse consequences including:

•

Impacting our ability to satisfy our obligations;

•

Increasing the portion of our cash flows from operations may
    have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may
    not be available for operations, working capital, capital
    expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or
    other purposes;

•

Impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the
    future;

•

Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to,
    changes in our business and industry; and

•

Making us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our
    industry or the economy in general.

Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will
    depend on our future performance, which will be affected by
    financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We
    will not be able to control many of these factors, such as
    economic conditions and governmental regulations. Furthermore,
    our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable
    us to meet our expenses and service our debt. As a result, we
    may be required to repatriate funds from our foreign
    subsidiaries which could result in a significant tax liability
    to us. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from
    operations, or if we are unable to repatriate sufficient or any
    funds from our foreign subsidiaries, in order to meet our
    expenses and debt service obligations, we may need to enter into
    new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds, or we
    may be required to raise additional funds through other means.
    If we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for
    any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if
    funding is available, obtain it on acceptable terms. If we fail
    to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such
    debt, and this default could cause us to be in default on our
    other outstanding indebtedness.

The
    note hedges and warrant transactions that we entered into in
    connection with the sale of the Notes may affect the trading
    price of our common stock.

In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into
    privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with
    certain option counterparties (the “Counterparties”),
    which are expected to offset the potential dilution to our
    common stock upon any conversion of the Notes. At the same time,
    we also entered into warrant transactions with the
    Counterparties pursuant to which we may issue shares of our
    common stock above a certain strike price. In connection with
    these hedging transactions, the Counterparties may have entered
    into various

over-the-counter

derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or
    purchased shares of our common stock in secondary market
    transactions at or following the pricing of the Notes. Such
    activities may have had the effect of increasing the price of
    our common stock. The Counterparties are likely to modify their
    hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or
    maturity of the Notes by purchasing and selling shares of our
    common stock or entering into other derivative transactions.
    Additionally, these transactions may expose us to counterparty
    credit risk for nonperformance. The effect, if any, of any of
    these transactions and activities on the market price of our
    common stock or the Notes will depend, in part, on market
    conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any



of these activities could adversely affect the value of our
    common stock. In addition, if our stock price exceeds the strike
    price for the warrants, there could be additional dilution to
    our shareholders, which could adversely affect the value of our
    common stock.

Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives, Inc. (“Lehman OTC”)
    was the counterparty to 20% of our Note hedges. The bankruptcy
    filing by Lehman OTC on October 3, 2008 constituted an
    “event of default” under the hedge transaction. In
    April 2010, we terminated the hedge transaction with Lehman OTC
    in exchange for an unsecured bankruptcy claim, which we
    subsequently sold to a third party for approximately
    $14 million. Because we have decided not to replace the
    hedge, we are subject to potential dilution on the 20% unhedged
    portion of our Notes upon conversion if on the date of
    conversion the per-share market price of our common stock
    exceeds the conversion price of $31.85. The terms of the Notes,
    the rights of the holders of the Notes and other counterparties
    to Note hedges and warrants were not affected by the termination
    of this hedge.

The price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of
    our common stock by investors who view the Notes as a more
    attractive means of equity participation in our company and by
    hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop
    involving our common stock by holders of the Notes. The hedging
    or arbitrage could, in turn, affect the trading price of the
    Notes and warrants.

Future
    issuances of common stock related to our Notes, warrants, stock
    options, restricted stock units, and our Employee Stock Purchase
    Plan may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock
    and the Notes.

The conversion of some or all of our outstanding Notes will
    dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the
    extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the Notes. We
    will satisfy our obligation upon conversion by delivering cash
    for the principal amount of the Notes and shares of common
    stock, if any, to the extent the conversion value exceeds the
    principal amount. Any new issuance of equity securities,
    including the issuance of shares upon conversion of the Notes or
    the exercise of related warrants which are not offset by our
    Note hedges, could dilute the interests of our then-existing
    stockholders, including holders who receive shares upon
    conversion of their Notes, and could substantially decrease the
    trading price of our common stock and the Notes. In addition,
    any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon
    such conversion or the exercise of warrants could adversely
    affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.

As of April 30, 2010, we had options to purchase
    approximately 35 million shares of our common stock
    outstanding and a total of approximately 9 million
    restricted shares and restricted stock units outstanding. If all
    of these outstanding options were exercised, and all of the
    outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units vested,
    the proceeds to the Company would average approximately $18 per
    share. We also had 15.5 million shares of our common stock
    reserved for issuance under our stock plans with respect to
    equity awards that have not been granted. The exercise of all of
    the outstanding options

and/or

the
    vesting of all outstanding restricted shares and restricted
    stock units would dilute the interests of our then-existing
    stockholders, and any sales in the public market of the common
    stock issuable upon such exercise could adversely affect the
    trading price of our common stock.

In addition, we have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)
    under which employees are entitled to purchase shares of our
    common stock at 85% of the fair market value at certain
    specified dates over a two-year period. As of April 30,
    2010, we had approximately 5.0 million shares of our common
    stock available for issuance under the ESPP. The issuance of
    shares under the ESPP would dilute the interests of our
    then-existing stockholders, and any sales in the public market
    of the common stock issuable upon such exercise could adversely
    affect the trading price of our common stock.

We may issue equity securities in the future for a number of
    reasons, including to finance our operations related to business
    strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic
    alliances or other transactions), to increase our capital, to
    adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations
    upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options upon
    conversion of the Notes, or for other reasons.



We are
    exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio
    investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments
    could harm our financial results.

At April 30, 2010, we had $3.8 billion in cash, cash
    equivalents,

available-for-sale

securities and restricted cash and investments. We invest our
    cash in a variety of financial instruments, consisting
    principally of investments in U.S. Treasury securities,
    commercial paper, U.S. government agency bonds, corporate
    bonds, auction rate securities, certificates of deposit, and
    money market funds. These investments are subject to general
    credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which have
    been exacerbated by unusual events such as the financial and
    credit crisis, and bankruptcy filings in the United States which
    have affected various sectors of the financial markets and led
    to global credit and liquidity issues. These securities are
    generally classified as

“available-for-sale”

and, consequently, are recorded on our consolidated balance
    sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as
    a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),
    net of tax.

Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest
    earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed
    rate debt securities may have their market value adversely
    impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate
    securities may produce less income than expected if interest
    rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment
    income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest
    rates. Currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments
    in our investment portfolio. We may suffer losses if forced to
    sell securities that have experienced a decline in market value
    because of changes in interest rates. Currently, we do not use
    financial derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure.

The fair value of our investments may change significantly due
    to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets. For
    instance, as a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman
    Brothers, which occurred during fiscal 2009, we recorded an

other-than-temporary

impairment charge of $11.8 million on our corporate bonds
    related to investments in Lehman Brothers securities and
    approximately $9.3 million on our investments in the
    Primary Fund that held Lehman Brothers investments. Any
    investment securities that we hold or the issues of such
    securities could be subject to review for possible downgrade.
    Any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an
    additional decline in the estimated fair value of our
    investments. Changes in the various assumptions used to value
    these securities and any increase in the markets’ perceived
    risk associated with such investments may also result in a
    decline in estimated fair value. If such investments suffer
    market price declines, as we experienced with some of our
    investments during fiscal 2009, we may recognize in earnings the
    decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost
    basis when the decline is judged to be

other-than-temporary.

On occasion, we make strategic investments in other companies,
    including private equity funds, which may decline in value

and/or

not
    meet desired objectives. The success of these investments
    depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no
    control. As of April 30, 2010, we had an investment with
    the carrying value of $1.4 million in a private equity
    fund. The risks to our strategic investment portfolio may be
    exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic
    conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment
    portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment
    charges.

In the event of adverse conditions in the credit and capital
    markets, our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could
    determine that some or all of our investments have experienced
    an

other-than-temporary

decline in fair value, requiring further impairments, which
    could adversely impact our financial position and operating
    results.

A
    significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents balances
    are held overseas. If we are not able to generate sufficient
    cash domestically in order to fund our U.S. operations and
    strategic opportunities, and to service our debt, we may incur a
    significant tax liability in order to repatriate the overseas
    cash balances, or we may need to raise additional capital in the
    future.

A portion of our earnings which is generated from our
    international operations is held and invested by certain of our
    foreign subsidiaries. These amounts are not freely available for
    dividend repatriation to the United States without triggering
    significant adverse tax consequences, which could adversely
    affect our financial results. As a result, if the cash generated
    by our domestic operations is not sufficient to fund our
    domestic operations, our broader corporate initiatives such as
    stock repurchases, acquisitions, and other strategic
    opportunities, and to service our outstanding indebtedness, we
    may need to raise additional funds through public or private
    debt or equity financings, or we may need to obtain new credit
    facilities to the extent we choose not to repatriate our
    overseas cash. Such



additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to
    us, or at all, and any new equity financings or offerings would
    dilute our current stockholders’ ownership. Furthermore,
    lenders, particularly in light of the current challenges in the
    credit markets, may not agree to extend us new, additional or
    continuing credit. If adequate funds are not available, or are
    not available on acceptable terms, we may be forced to
    repatriate our foreign cash and incur a significant tax expense
    or we may not be able to take advantage of strategic
    opportunities, develop new products, respond to competitive
    pressures or repay our outstanding indebtedness. In any such
    case, our business, operating results or financial condition
    could be adversely impacted.

Our
    synthetic leases are off-balance sheet arrangements that could
    negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.
    We have invested substantial resources in new facilities and
    physical infrastructure, which will increase our fixed costs.
    Our operating results could be harmed if our business does not
    grow proportionately to our increase in fixed
    costs.

We have various synthetic lease arrangements with BNP Paribas
    Leasing Corporation as lessor (“BBPPLC”) for our
    headquarters office buildings and land in Sunnyvale, California.
    These synthetic leases qualify for operating lease accounting
    treatment under the accounting guidance for leases and are not
    considered variable interest entities under applicable
    accounting guidance. Therefore, we do not include the properties
    or the associated debt on our condensed consolidated balance
    sheet. However, if circumstances were to change regarding our or
    BNPPLC’s ownership of the properties, or in BNPPLC’s
    overall portfolio, we could be required to consolidate the
    entity, the leased facilities and the associated debt.

Our future minimum lease payments under these synthetic leases
    limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes
    in our business by restricting the funds available for use in
    addressing such changes. If we are unable to grow our business
    and revenues proportionately to our increase in fixed costs, our
    operating results will be harmed. If we elect not to purchase
    the properties at the end of the lease term, we have guaranteed
    a minimum residual value to BNPPLC. If the fair value of the
    properties declines below that guaranteed minimum residual
    value, our residual value guarantee would require us to pay the
    difference to BNPPLC. As of April 30, 2010, the estimated
    fair value of the properties was approximately
    $36.9 million below the guaranteed minimum residual value,
    which we will accrue over the remaining term of the respective
    leases. Any further decline in the fair value of the properties
    could adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition and
    operating results.

As a result of excess capacity in our Sunnyvale facilities,
    certain of our facilities subject to synthetic lease
    arrangements have been subleased or are vacant. These subleases
    will expire through 2012 and we may not be able to generate
    sufficient sublease income to cover the carrying costs of these
    facilities. In addition, we may experience changes in our
    operations in the future that could result in additional excess
    capacity and vacant facilities. We will continue to be
    responsible for all carrying costs of these facilities under
    operating leases until such time as we can sublease these
    facilities or terminate the applicable leases based on the
    contractual terms of the operating lease agreements, and these
    costs may have an adverse effect on our business, operating
    results and financial condition.

We
    have credit exposure to our hedging
    counterparties.

In order to minimize volatility in earnings associated with
    fluctuations in the value of foreign currency relative to the
    U.S. Dollar, we utilize forward and option contracts to
    hedge our exposure to foreign currencies. As a result of
    entering into these hedging contracts with major financial
    institutions, we may be subject to counterparty nonperformance
    risk. Should there be a counterparty default, we could be
    exposed to the net losses on the hedged arrangements or be
    unable to recover anticipated net gains from the transactions.

We are
    subject to restrictive and financial covenants in our synthetic
    lease arrangements. The restrictive covenants may restrict our
    ability to operate our business.

Our ongoing extension of credit under our synthetic lease
    arrangements are subject to continued compliance with financial
    covenants. If we do not comply with these restrictive and
    financial covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements,
    we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts or
    repurchase the properties which are subject to the synthetic
    lease arrangements. If we lose access to the synthetic lease
    arrangements, we may not be able to obtain alternative financing
    on acceptable terms, which could limit our operating flexibility.



The agreements governing our synthetic lease arrangements
    contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate
    our business, including restrictions on our ability to:

•

Incur indebtedness;

•

Incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level;

•

Grant liens;

•

Sell all or substantially all our assets:

•

Enter into certain mergers;

•

Change our business;

•

Enter into swap agreements;

•

Enter into transactions with our affiliates; and

•

Enter into certain restrictive agreements.

As a result of these restrictive covenants, our ability to
    respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to
    obtain additional financing, if needed, may be restricted. We
    may also be prevented from engaging in transactions that might
    otherwise be beneficial to us, such as strategic acquisitions or
    joint ventures.

Our failure to comply with the restrictive and financial
    covenants could result in a default under our synthetic lease
    arrangements, which would give the counterparties thereto the
    ability to exercise certain rights, including the right to
    accelerate the amounts owed thereunder and to terminate the
    arrangement. In addition, our failure to comply with these
    covenants and the acceleration of amounts owed under synthetic
    lease arrangements could result in a default under the Notes,
    which could permit the holders to accelerate the Notes. If all
    of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds
    available to repay such debt.

Funds
    associated with certain of our auction rate securities may not
    be accessible for more than 12 months and our auction rate
    securities may experience further

other-than-temporary

declines in value, which would adversely affect our
    earnings.

Auction rate securities (ARSs) held by us are securities with
    long-term nominal maturities, which, in accordance with
    investment policy guidelines, had credit ratings of AAA and Aaa
    at time of purchase. Interest rates for ARS are reset through a
    “Dutch auction” each month, which prior to February
    2008 had provided a liquid market for these securities.

All of our ARSs are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed
    by the U.S. Department of Education, and we believe the
    credit quality of these securities is high based on this
    guarantee. However, liquidity issues in the global credit
    markets resulted in the failure of auctions for certain of our
    ARS investments, with a par value of $73.8 million. For
    each failed auction, the interest rate resets to a maximum rate
    defined for each security, and the ARS continue to pay interest
    in accordance with their terms, although the principal
    associated with the ARS will not be accessible until there is a
    successful auction or such time as other markets for ARS
    investments develop or the final maturity of the individual
    securities.

As of April 30, 2010, we determined there was a total
    decline in the fair value of our ARS investments of
    approximately $4.7 million, of which we have recorded
    cumulative temporary impairment charges of $2.6 million,
    and $2.1 million was recognized as an

other-than-temporary

impairment charge. In addition, we have classified all of our
    auction rate securities as long-term assets in our consolidated
    balance sheets at April 30, 2010 as our ability to
    liquidate such securities in the next 12 months is
    uncertain. Although we currently have the ability and intent to
    hold these ARS investments until recovery in market value or
    until maturity, if current market conditions deteriorate
    further, or the anticipated recovery in market liquidity does
    not occur, we may be required to record additional impairment
    charges in future quarters.



We may
    need to undertake cost-reduction initiatives and restructuring
    initiatives in the future.

We have previously recognized restructuring charges related to
    initiatives to realign our business strategies and resize our
    business in response to economic and market conditions,
    including those announced in February 2009 and December 2008. We
    may undertake future cost-reduction initiatives and
    restructuring plans that may adversely impact our operations and
    we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our prior
    or any future restructurings.

Our
    acquisitions may not provide the anticipated benefits and may
    disrupt our existing business.

As part of our strategy, we are continuously evaluating
    opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would
    complement our current products, expand the breadth of our
    markets, or enhance our technical capabilities. The success of
    our acquisitions is impacted by a number of factors, and may be
    subject to the following risks:

•

The inability to successfully integrate the operations,
    technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies;

•

The diversion of management’s attention from normal daily
    operations of the business;

•

The loss of key employees;

•

Substantial transaction costs and accounting charges; and

•

Exposure to litigation related to acquisitions.

Any future acquisitions may also result in risks to our existing
    business, including:

•

Dilution of our current stockholders’ percentage ownership
    to the extent we issue new equity;

•

Assumption of additional liabilities;

•

Incurrence of additional debt or a decline in available cash;

•

Adverse effects to our financial statements, such as the need to
    make large and immediate write-offs or the incurrence of
    restructuring and other related expenses;

•

Liability for intellectual property infringement and other
    litigation claims, which we may or may not be aware of at the
    time of acquisition; and

•

Creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could
    result in significant future amortization expense or impairment
    charges.

The failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of an
    acquisition may also result in impairment charges for goodwill
    or acquired intangibles. For example, in fiscal 2009, we
    announced our decision to cease the development and availability
    of our SMOS product, which was originally acquired through our
    acquisition of Topio, Inc. in fiscal 2007, resulting in the
    impairment of acquired intangibles related to such acquisition.
    Additional or realized risks of this nature could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

The occurrence of any of the above risks could seriously harm
    our business.

If we
    are unable to establish fair value for any undelivered element
    of a sales arrangement, all or a portion of the revenues
    relating to the arrangement could be deferred to future
    periods.

In the course of our sales efforts, we often enter into multiple
    element arrangements that include our systems and one or more of
    the following undelivered software-related elements: software
    entitlements and maintenance, premium hardware maintenance, and
    storage review services. If we are required to change the
    pricing of our software-related elements through discounting, or
    otherwise introduce variability in the pricing of such elements,
    we may be unable to maintain Vendor Specific Objective Evidence
    of fair value of the undelivered elements of the arrangement,
    and would therefore be required to delay the recognition of all
    or a portion of the related arrangement. A delay in the
    recognition of revenues may cause fluctuations in our financial
    results and may adversely affect our operating margins.



We are
    continually seeking ways to make our cost structure and business
    processes more efficient, including moving activities from
    higher-cost to lower-cost owned locations, as well as
    outsourcing certain business process functions. Problems with
    the execution of these activities could have an adverse effect
    on our business or results of operations.

We continuously seek to make our cost structure and business
    processes more efficient. We are focused on increasing workforce
    flexibility and scalability, and improving overall
    competitiveness by leveraging our global capabilities, as well
    as external talent and skills worldwide. For example, certain
    engineering activities and projects that were formerly performed
    in the U.S. have been moved to lower cost international
    locations and we rely on partners or third party service
    providers for the provision of certain business process
    functions and activities in IT, human resources and accounting.

The challenges involved with these initiatives include executing
    business functions in accordance with local laws and other
    obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and
    procedures. We are also subject to increased business continuity
    risks as we increase our reliance on such parties. For example,
    we may no longer be able to exercise control over some aspects
    of the future development, support or maintenance of outsourced
    operations and processes, including the management and internal
    controls associated with those outsourced business operations
    and processes, which could adversely affect our business. If we
    are unable to effectively utilize or integrate and interoperate
    with external resources or if our partners or third party
    service providers experience business difficulties or are unable
    to provide business services as anticipated, we may need to seek
    alternative service providers or resume providing these business
    processes internally, which could be costly and time-consuming
    and have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In
    addition, we may not achieve the expected benefits of our
    business process improvement initiatives.

We are
    subject to risks related to the provision of employee health
    care benefits.

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for
    workers’ compensation coverage and health care plans. We
    record expenses under these plans based on estimates of the
    number and costs of expected claims, administrative costs and
    stop-loss premiums. These estimates are then adjusted each year
    to reflect actual costs incurred. Actual costs under these plans
    are subject to variability depending primarily upon participant
    enrollment and demographics, the actual number and costs of
    claims made and whether and how much the stop-loss insurance we
    purchase covers the cost of these claims. In the event that our
    cost estimates differ from actual costs, we could incur
    additional unplanned health care costs which could adversely
    impact our financial condition.

In March 2010, comprehensive health care reform legislation
    under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (HR
    3590) and the Health Care Education and Affordability
    Reconciliation Act (HR 4872) (collectively, the
    “Acts”) was passed and signed into law. Among other
    things, the health reform legislation includes guaranteed
    coverage requirements, eliminates pre-existing condition
    exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits, restricts the
    extent to which policies can be rescinded, and imposes new and
    significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits.
    Provisions of the health reform legislation become effective at
    various dates over the next several years. The Department of
    Health and Human Services, the National Association of Insurance
    Commissioners, the Department of Labor and the Treasury
    Department have yet to issue necessary enabling regulations and
    guidance with respect to the health care reform legislation.

Due to the breadth and complexity of the health reform
    legislation, the lack of implementing regulations and
    interpretive guidance, and the phased-in nature of the
    implementation, it is difficult to predict the overall impact of
    the health reform legislation on our business over the coming
    years. Possible adverse affects of the health reform legislation
    include reduced revenues, increased costs, exposure to expanded
    liability and requirements for us to revise the ways in which we
    conduct business or risk of loss of business. In addition, our
    results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could
    be materially adversely affected.

We
    depend on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. If we
    are unable to attract and retain such personnel, our operating
    results could be materially and adversely
    impacted.

Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to
    identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel.
    Because our future success is dependent on our ability to
    continue to enhance and introduce new



products, we are particularly dependent on our ability to
    identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified engineers with
    the requisite education, background and industry experience.
    Competition for qualified employees, particularly in Silicon
    Valley, can be intense. The loss of the services of a
    significant number of our employees, particularly our engineers,
    salespeople and key managers, could be disruptive to our
    development efforts or business relationships and could
    materially and adversely affect our operating results.

Additionally, a component of our strategy to hire and retain
    personnel consists of long-term compensation in the form of
    equity-based grants. We face increased risk of the inability to
    continue to offer equity if we are unable to obtain shareholder
    approval in light of increased shareholder activism and
    heightened focus on corporate compensation practices. Such
    inability could adversely impact our ability to continue to
    attract and retain employees.

Our
    business could be materially and adversely affected as a result
    of a natural disaster, terrorist acts or other catastrophic
    events.

We depend on the ability of our personnel, raw materials,
    equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the
    world. Any political, military, terrorism, global trade, world
    health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts
    the import or export of materials could lead to significant
    business disruptions. Furthermore, any strike, economic failure
    or other material disruption caused by fire, floods, hurricanes,
    volcanoes, power loss, power shortages, environmental disasters,
    telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events could
    also adversely affect our ability to conduct business. If such
    disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or
    contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or
    corporate spending on information technology, or directly impact
    our marketing, manufacturing, financial and logistics functions,
    our results of operations and financial condition could be
    materially adversely affected. In addition, our headquarters are
    located in Northern California, an area susceptible to
    earthquakes. If any significant disaster were to occur, our
    ability to operate our business could be impaired.

Undetected
    software errors, hardware errors, or failures found in new
    products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of
    our products, which could increase our costs and reduce our
    revenues. Product quality problems could lead to reduced
    revenues, gross margins and operating results.

Our products may contain undetected software errors, hardware
    errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are
    released. Despite testing by us and by current and potential
    customers, errors may not be found in new products until after
    commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of or
    delay in market acceptance, which could materially and adversely
    affect our operating results.

In addition, if we fail to remedy a product defect, we may
    experience a failure of a product line, temporary or permanent
    withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation,
    inventory costs or product reengineering expenses, and these
    occurrences could have a material impact on our revenues, gross
    margins and operating results. We may be subject to losses that
    may result from or are alleged to result from defects in our
    products, which could subject us to claims for damages,
    including consequential damages.

We are
    exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims
    and protection of intellectual property rights, which could
    adversely affect our operating results.

We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business,
    including our ongoing litigation with Sun Microsystems which was
    recently acquired by Oracle Corporation. Litigation can be
    expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations.
    Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult
    to predict. An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
    results, or financial condition.

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may be
    subject to increased competition that could materially and
    adversely affect our operating results. Our success depends
    significantly upon our proprietary technology. We rely on a
    combination of copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets,
    confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and patents
    to protect our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our
    software, documentation and other written materials under trade
    secret, copyright and patent laws, which afford only limited
    protection.



Some of our U.S. trademarks are registered internationally
    as well. We will continue to evaluate the registration of
    additional trademarks as appropriate. We generally enter into
    confidentiality agreements with our employees and with our
    resellers, strategic partners and customers. We currently have
    multiple U.S. and international patent applications pending
    and multiple U.S. patents issued. The pending applications
    may not be approved, and our existing and future patents may be
    challenged. If such challenges are brought, the patents may be
    invalidated. We may not be able to develop proprietary products
    or technologies that are patentable, or where any issued patent
    will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be
    challenged by third parties. Further, the patents of others may
    materially and adversely affect our ability to do business. In
    addition, a failure to obtain and defend our trademark
    registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and
    competitive position.

Litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary
    technology. Any such litigation may be time-consuming and
    costly. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,
    unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products
    or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In
    addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect
    proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the
    United States. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights
    may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop
    similar technology, duplicate our products, or design around
    patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of
    ours.

We are subject to intellectual property infringement claims. We
    may, from time to time, receive claims that we are infringing
    third parties’ intellectual property rights. Third parties
    may in the future, claim infringement by us with respect to
    current or future products, patents, trademarks or other
    proprietary rights. We expect that companies in the network
    storage and data management market will increasingly be subject
    to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors
    in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products
    in different industry segments overlaps. Any such claims could
    be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product
    shipment delays, require us to redesign our products or enter
    into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could
    materially and adversely affect our operating results. Such
    royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be
    available on terms acceptable to us or at all.

Our
    business could be materially adversely affected by changes in
    regulations or standards regarding energy efficiency of our
    products and climate change issues.

We continually seek ways to increase the energy efficiency of
    our products. Recent analyses have estimated the amount of
    global carbon emissions that are due to information technology
    products. As a result, governmental and non-governmental
    organizations have turned their attention to development of
    regulations and standards to drive technological improvements
    and reduce such amount of carbon emissions. There is a risk that
    the development of these standards will not fully address the
    complexity of the technology developed by the IT industry or
    will favor certain technological approaches. Depending on the
    regulations or standards that are ultimately adopted, compliance
    could adversely affect our business, financial condition or
    operating results.

Climate change issues, energy usage and emissions controls may
    result in new environmental legislation and regulations, at any
    or all of the international, federal and state levels, that may
    unfavorably impact us, our suppliers, and our customers in how
    we conduct our business including the design, development, and
    manufacturing of our products. This could cause us to incur
    additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental
    regulations, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from
    our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance
    costs that get passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact
    our operations and financial condition.

Our business and results of operations could be adversely
    impacted as a consequence of regulations or business trends such
    as:

•

Decreased demand for storage products that produce significant
    greenhouse gases

•

Increased demand for storage products that produce lower
    emissions and are more energy efficient, and increased
    competition to develop such products; and

•

Reputational risk based on negative public perception of
    publicly reported data on our greenhouse gas emissions.



Our
    business is subject to increasingly complex corporate
    governance, public disclosure, accounting and tax requirements
    that have increased both our costs and the risk of
    noncompliance.

Because our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to
    certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial
    market exchange entities charged with the protection of
    investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are
    publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC, and NASDAQ, have
    implemented requirements and regulations and continue developing
    additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate
    scandals and laws enacted by Congress, most notably the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our efforts to comply with these
    regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue
    resulting in, increased general and administrative expenses and
    diversion of management time and attention from
    revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.

We completed our evaluation of our internal controls over
    financial reporting for the fiscal year ended April 30,
    2010 as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
    of 2002. Although our assessment, testing and evaluation
    resulted in our conclusion that as of April 30, 2010, our
    internal controls over financial reporting were effective, we
    cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods. If
    our internal controls are ineffective in future periods, our
    business and reputation could be harmed. We may incur additional
    expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection
    with further evaluations, both of which could materially
    increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our
    operating results.

Because new and modified laws, regulations, and standards are
    subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their
    lack of specificity, their application in practice may evolve
    over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and
    governing bodies. This evolution may result in continuing
    uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs
    necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and
    governance practices.

Changes
    in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected
    fluctuations and affect our reported results of
    operations.

A change in accounting standards or practices and varying
    interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements, such as
    changes to standards related to revenue recognition standards
    recently adopted by the FASB, the increased use of fair value
    measure, and the potential requirement that
    U.S. registrants prepare financial statements in accordance
    with International Financial Reporting Standards
    (“IFRS”), could have a significant effect on our
    reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.

Properties

We own approximately 0.9 million square feet of facilities
    at our Sunnyvale, California headquarters, of which we occupy
    approximately 0.8 million square feet. In addition, we have
    commitments related to various lease arrangements with BNP
    Paribas LLC (“BNP”) for approximately 0.6 million
    square feet of additional facilities, of which we occupy
    approximately 0.3 million square feet (as further described
    below under “Contractual Obligations” in Item 7
    and Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements under Item 8). Our headquarters site supports
    corporate general administration, sales and marketing, research
    and development, global services, and operations.

We own approximately 0.6 million square feet of facilities
    in Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina, of which we
    occupy approximately 0.5 million square feet. This site
    supports sales and marketing, research and development, and
    global services.

We lease and occupy approximately 0.3 million square feet
    of facilities in Bangalore, India. We also own fifteen acres of
    land in Bangalore, India to be developed for future use. This
    site supports sales and marketing, research and development, and
    global services.



We lease other sales offices and research and development
    facilities throughout the U.S. and internationally. We
    expect that our existing facilities and those being developed
    worldwide are suitable and adequate for our requirements over at
    least the next two years and that additional space will be
    available as needed.

Legal
    Proceedings

On September 5, 2007, we filed a patent infringement
    lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory
    damages and a permanent injunction against Sun Microsystems. On
    October 25, 2007, Sun Microsystems filed a counter
    claim against us in the Eastern District of Texas seeking
    compensatory damages and a permanent injunction. On
    October 29, 2007, Sun filed a second lawsuit against us in
    the Northern District of California asserting additional patents
    against us. The Texas court granted a joint motion to transfer
    the Texas lawsuit to the Northern District of California on
    November 26, 2007. On March 26, 2008, Sun filed a
    third lawsuit in federal court that extends the patent
    infringement charges to storage management technology we
    acquired in January 2008. In January 2010, Oracle acquired Sun.
    The three lawsuits are currently in the discovery and motion
    phase and no trial dates have been set, so we are unable at this
    time to determine the likely outcome of these various patent
    litigations. Since we are unable to reasonably estimate the
    amount or range of any potential settlement, no accrual has been
    recorded as of April 30, 2010.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion of our financial condition and results
    of operations should be read together with the financial
    statements and the related notes set forth under
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data”. The following discussion also contains trend
    information and other forward looking statements that involve a
    number of risks and uncertainties. The Risk Factors set forth in
    “Item 1. Business” are hereby incorporated into
    the discussion by reference.



Overview

Revenues for fiscal 2010 were $3.9 billion, up
    $0.5 billion, or 15%, from fiscal 2009. Improved revenue
    performance in fiscal 2010 was the result of improvements in
    product, software entitlements and maintenance and service
    revenues. Revenues in fiscal 2009 were negatively impacted by a
    $128.7 million settlement with the General Services
    Administration (GSA). The dispute regarded our discounting
    practices and compliance with the price reduction provisions of
    GSA contracts between August 1997 and February 2005.

Gross profit margins increased during fiscal 2010 due largely to
    reductions in product materials cost, partially offset by a
    decrease in the overall average selling prices of our products,
    as well as an increase in our SEM and services revenues mix
    relative to product revenues. In addition, our gross profit
    margin in fiscal 2009 was negatively impacted by the GSA
    settlement.

During fiscal 2010, sales and marketing, research and
    development, and general and administrative expenses totaled
    $2.1 billion, up 10% from fiscal 2009 and reflected the
    impact of an increase in incentive compensation and commissions
    expense related to our stronger sales and operating profit
    performance, as well as having 53 weeks in fiscal 2010
    compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2009.

During fiscal 2010, we entered into a merger agreement with Data
    Domain, Inc., which was subsequently terminated on July 8,
    2009. In accordance with the agreement, we received a
    $57.0 million termination fee, which, when netted against
    $15.9 million of incremental third-party costs we incurred
    relating to the terminated merger transaction, resulted in net
    proceeds of $41.1 million.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates and Policies

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
    of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
    statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. The preparation of such statements requires us to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the
    financial statements. Our estimates are based on historical
    experience and other assumptions that we consider to be
    appropriate in the circumstances. However, actual future results
    may vary from our estimates.

We believe that the following accounting policies are
    significantly affected by critical accounting estimates and that
    they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial
    condition and results and require difficult management judgments
    and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.
    Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements describes the significant accounting policies used in
    the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
    Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered
    to be critical accounting policies.

We believe the accounting policies described below are the ones
    that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments
    and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results
    of operations.

Revenue
    Recognition, Reserves and Allowances

We apply the provisions of the accounting guidance for software
    revenue recognition to our product sales, both hardware and
    software, because our software is essential to the performance
    of our hardware. We recognize revenue when:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists:

It is our customary practice to have a
    purchase order

and/or

contract prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement from our
    end users, customers, value-added resellers, or distributors.

•

Delivery has occurred:

Our product is
    physically delivered to our customers, generally with standard
    transfer terms such as FOB origin. We typically do not allow for
    restocking rights with any of our value-added resellers or
    distributors. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or
    return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria
    are achieved. If undelivered products or services exist that are
    essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an
    arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred.



•

The fee is fixed or determinable:

Arrangements
    with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms,
    conditions and practices are not considered to be fixed or
    determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized at
    the earlier of customer payment or when the fees become due and
    payable. We typically do not allow for price-protection rights
    with any of our value-added resellers or distributors.

•

Collection is probable:

If there is
    considerable doubt surrounding the credit worthiness of a
    customer at the outset of an arrangement, the associated revenue
    is deferred and recognized upon cash receipt.

Our multiple element arrangements include our systems and one or
    more of the following undelivered software-related elements:
    software entitlements and maintenance, premium hardware
    maintenance and storage review services. Our software
    entitlements and maintenance entitle our customers to receive
    unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a

when-and-if-available

basis, bug fixes, and patch releases. Premium hardware
    maintenance services include contracts for technical support and
    minimum response times. Revenues from software entitlements and
    maintenance, premium hardware maintenance services and storage
    review services are recognized ratably over the contractual
    term, generally from one to three years. We also offer extended
    service contracts (which extend our standard parts warranty and
    may include premium hardware maintenance) at the end of the
    warranty term; revenues from these contracts are recognized
    ratably over the contract term. We typically sell professional
    services separately from any of our other revenue elements,
    either on a time and materials basis or for fixed price standard
    projects; we recognize revenue for these services as they are
    performed. Revenue from hardware installation services is
    recognized in the period the services are delivered. For
    arrangements with multiple elements, we recognize as revenue the
    difference between the total arrangement price and the greater
    of fair value or stated price for any undelivered elements
    (“the residual method”).

For our undelivered software-related elements, we determine fair
    value of these undelivered elements based on vendor-specific
    objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value, which for
    us consists of the prices charged when these services are sold
    separately. To determine the fair value of these elements, we
    analyze both the selling prices when elements are sold
    separately as well as the concentrations of those prices. We
    believe those concentrations have been sufficient to enable us
    to establish VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements. If
    VSOE cannot be obtained to establish fair value of the
    undelivered elements, it is required that revenue from the
    entire arrangement be initially deferred and recognized ratably
    over the period these elements are delivered.

For purposes of presentation in the statement of operations,
    once fair value has been determined for our undelivered bundled
    elements, we allocate revenue first to software entitlements and
    maintenance, based on VSOE of its fair value, with the remainder
    allocated to other service revenues.

We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at
    the time of shipment. Sales returns are estimated based on
    historical sales returns, current trends, and our expectations
    regarding future experience. We monitor and analyze the accuracy
    of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and
    adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of
    our current and future reserve needs. Our reserve levels have
    been sufficient to cover actual returns and have not required
    material changes in subsequent periods. While we currently have
    no expectations for significant changes to these reserves, if
    actual future returns and allowances differ from past
    experience, additional allowances may be required.

We also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for
    estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility
    of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts
    receivable. We analyze accounts receivable and historical bad
    debts, customer concentrations, customer solvency, current
    economic and geographic trends, and changes in customer payment
    terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of our current
    and future allowance. In circumstances where we are aware of a
    specific customer’s inability to meet its financial
    obligations to us, a specific allowance for bad debt is
    estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable
    to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected.
    We monitor and analyze the accuracy of our allowance for
    doubtful accounts estimate by reviewing past collectibility and
    adjusting it for future expectations to determine the adequacy
    of our current and future allowance. Our reserve levels have
    generally been sufficient to cover credit losses. Our allowance
    for doubtful accounts as of April 30, 2010 was
    $1.6 million, compared to $3.1 million as of
    April 24, 2009. If the financial condition of our customers
    were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability
    to make payments, additional allowances may be required.



Inventory
    Valuation and Purchase Order Accruals

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (which
    approximates actual cost on a

first-in,

first-out basis). We perform an excess and obsolete analysis of
    our inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and
    market conditions. We adjust the inventory value based on
    estimated excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily
    by future demand forecasts. Although we strive for accuracy in
    our forecasts of future product demand, any significant
    unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments
    could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory
    commitments and on our reported results. If actual market
    conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional
    write-downs and other charges against earnings may be required.
    If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may realize
    higher gross profits in the period when the written-down
    inventory is sold. Historically, our inventory reserves have
    been sufficient to cover any excess and obsolete exposure and
    have not required material adjustments in subsequent periods.

In the normal course of business we make commitments to our
    third party contract manufacturers to manage lead times and meet
    product forecasts, and to other parties to purchase various key
    components used in the manufacture of our products. We establish
    accruals for estimated losses on purchased components for which
    we believe it is probable that they will not be utilized in
    future operations. To the extent that such forecasts are not
    achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may change.

We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and
    foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage,
    discharge, and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in the
    manufacture of our products, which may require design changes or
    recycling of products we manufacture. We will continue to
    monitor our compliance with these regulations, which may require
    us to incur higher costs, and adversely impact our operating
    results.

Valuation
    of Goodwill and Intangibles

Purchased intangible assets are amortized over their useful
    lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite.
    In-process research and development is capitalized at fair value
    and classified as indefinite-lived assets until completion or
    abandonment and is subject to periodic review for impairment.
    Accordingly, the allocation of acquisition cost to identifiable
    intangible assets has a significant impact on our future
    operating results. The allocation process requires extensive use
    of estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future cash
    flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets. Should
    conditions be different than management’s assessment,
    material write-downs of the fair value of intangible assets may
    be required. We periodically review the estimated remaining
    useful lives of our intangible assets. A reduction in the
    estimate of remaining useful life could result in accelerated
    amortization expense or a write-down in future periods. As such,
    any future write-downs of these assets would adversely affect
    our operating results.

We perform an annual review of the valuation of goodwill in the
    fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators
    of impairment exist. Triggering events for impairment reviews
    may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends,
    restructuring actions, lower projections of profitability, or a
    sustained decline in our market capitalization. Evaluations of
    possible impairment and, if applicable, adjustments to carrying
    values require us to estimate, among other factors, future cash
    flows, useful lives, and fair market values of our reporting
    units and assets. When we conduct our evaluation of goodwill,
    the fair value of goodwill is assessed using valuation
    techniques that require significant management judgment. Should
    conditions be different from management’s last assessment,
    significant write-downs of goodwill may be required, which would
    adversely affect our operating results. In fiscal 2010 we
    performed such evaluation and found no impairment of goodwill.

Restructuring
    Reserves

We recognize a liability for restructuring costs when the
    liability is incurred. The restructuring accruals are based upon
    management estimates at the time they are recorded. These
    estimates can change depending upon changes in facts and
    circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was
    recorded. The main components of our restructuring charges are
    workforce reduction, intangibles and fixed assets write-offs and
    non-cancelable lease costs related to excess facilities.
    Severance-related charges are accrued when it is determined that
    a liability has been incurred, which is generally when
    individuals have been notified of their termination dates and
    expected severance payments. We record contract cancellation
    costs when contracts are terminated. The decision to eliminate



excess facilities results in charges for lease termination fees
    and future commitments to pay lease charges, net of estimated
    future sublease income. We recognize charges for elimination of
    excess facilities when we have vacated the premises. Intangible
    asset write-offs consist of impairment of acquired intangible
    assets related to our decision to cease the development and
    availability of specific products. Fixed assets write-offs
    primarily consist of equipment, software and furniture
    associated with excess facilities being eliminated, and are
    based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash
    flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate
    sale or disposal of the equipment and furniture.

Our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some
    of which are beyond our control, including future real estate
    market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into
    subleases or lease termination agreements with terms as
    favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates. We
    regularly evaluate a number of factors to determine the
    appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring
    accruals, including the various assumptions noted above. If
    actual results differ significantly from our estimates, we may
    be required to adjust our restructuring accruals in the future.

Product
    Warranties

Estimated future warranty costs are expensed as a cost of
    product revenues when revenue is recognized, based on estimates
    of the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations
    including material, distribution and labor costs. Our accrued
    liability for estimated future warranty costs is included in
    other accrued liabilities and other long-term obligations on the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Factors that affect
    our warranty liability include the number of installed units,
    estimated material costs, estimated distribution costs and
    estimated labor costs. We periodically assess the adequacy of
    our warranty accrual and adjust the amount as considered
    necessary.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation using the Black-Scholes
    option pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option
    grant on the date of grant. Our option pricing model requires
    the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the
    expected stock price volatility, expected term, and forfeiture
    rate. Any changes in these highly subjective assumptions
    significantly impact stock-based compensation expense.

Loss
    Contingencies

We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies
    arising in the course of business. We consider the likelihood of
    the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a
    liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the
    amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated
    loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability
    has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount
    of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate
    current information available to us to determine whether such
    accruals should be adjusted.

Fair
    Value Measurements and Impairments

All of our

available-for-sale

investments and nonmarketable securities are subject to periodic
    impairment review. Investments are considered to be impaired
    when a decline in fair value is judged to be

other-than-temporary.

This determination requires significant judgment. For publicly
    traded investments, impairment is determined based upon the
    specific facts and circumstances present at the time, including
    factors such as current economic and market conditions, the
    credit rating of the security’s issuer, the length of time
    an investment’s fair value has been below our carrying
    value, and our ability and intent to hold investments to
    maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any
    anticipated recovery in fair value. If an investment’s
    decline in fair value, caused by factors other than changes in
    interest rates, is deemed to be

other-than-temporary,

we reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value, as
    determined based on quoted market prices, liquidation values or
    other metrics. For investments in publicly held companies, we
    recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair
    value of our investment is below its cost basis and is judged to
    be

other-than-temporary.

The ultimate value realized on these investments is subject to
    market price volatility until they are sold.



Pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurement
    and its subsequent updates, fair value is defined as the price
    that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability (i.e., the “exit price”) in an orderly
    transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
    The accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used
    in measuring fair value that minimizes the use of unobservable
    inputs by requiring the use of observable market data when
    available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants
    would use in pricing the asset or liability based on active
    market data. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the
    assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset
    or liability based on the best information available in the
    circumstances.

The fair value hierarchy is broken down into the three input
    levels summarized below:

•

Level 1 — Valuations are based on quoted prices
    in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, and
    readily accessible by us at the reporting date. Examples of
    assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs are certain
    money market funds, U.S. Treasuries and trading securities
    with quoted prices on active markets.

•

Level 2 — Valuations based on inputs other than
    the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either
    directly or indirectly in active markets. Examples of assets and
    liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs are
    U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial
    paper, certificates of deposit and

over-the-counter

derivatives.

•

Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs
    in which there is little or no market data, which require us to
    develop our own assumptions. Examples of assets and liabilities
    utilizing Level 3 inputs are cost method investments,
    auction rate securities (ARS) and the Primary Fund.

We measure our

available-for-sale

securities at fair value on a recurring basis.

Available-for-sale

securities include U.S. Treasury securities,
    U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial
    paper, ARSs, money market funds and certificates of deposit.
    Where possible, we utilize quoted market prices to measure and
    such items are classified as Level 1 in the hierarchy. When
    quoted market prices for identical assets are unavailable,
    varying valuation techniques are used. Such assets are
    classified as Level 2 or Level 3 in the hierarchy. We
    classify items in Level 2 if investments are valued using
    observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields,
    reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing
    sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. We
    classify items in Level 3 if investments are valued using a
    pricing model, based on unobservable inputs in the market or
    that require us to develop our own assumptions. Our assessment
    of the significance of a particular input to the fair value
    measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers
    factors specific to the investment.

We are also exposed to market risk relating to our

available-for-sale

investments due to uncertainties in the credit and capital
    markets. The fair value of our investments may change
    significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and
    capital markets. These securities/issuers could be subject to
    review for possible downgrade. Any downgrade in these credit
    ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated
    fair value of our investments. We monitor and evaluate the
    accounting for our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for
    additional

other-than-temporary

impairment charges.

We actively review current investment ratings, company specific
    events, and general economic conditions in managing our
    investments and determining whether there is a significant
    decline in fair value that is

other-than-temporary.

As of April 30, 2010 and April 24, 2009, our
    short-term and long-term investments in marketable securities
    have been classified as

“available-for-sale”

and are carried at fair value.

Available-for-sale

investments with original maturities of greater than three
    months at the date of purchases are classified as short-term
    investments as these investments generally consist of marketable
    securities that are intended to be available to meet current
    cash requirements. Currently, all marketable securities held by
    us are classified as

available-for-sale

and our entire ARS portfolio is classified as long-term
    investments.

Our ARS portfolio consists of securities with long-term nominal
    maturities which, in accordance with investment policy
    guidelines, had credit ratings of AAA and Aaa at the time of
    purchase. During fiscal 2008, we reclassified all of our
    investments in ARS from short-term investments to long-term
    investments as we believed our ability to liquidate these
    investments in the next twelve months was uncertain. Based on an
    analysis of the fair value and marketability of these
    investments, we recorded temporary impairment charges of
    approximately $3.3 million during fiscal 2010, partially
    offset by $0.7 million in unrealized gains within other
    comprehensive income (loss).



During fiscal 2009, we recorded temporary impairment charges of
    approximately $7.0 million, partially offset by
    $0.3 million in unrealized gains within other comprehensive
    income (loss). In addition, during fiscal 2009, we recorded an

other-than-temporary

impairment loss of $2.1 million due to a significant
    decline in the estimated fair values of certain of our ARS
    related to credit quality risk and rating downgrades.

The valuation models used to estimate the fair value of our ARS
    included numerous assumptions such as assessments of the
    underlying structure of each security, expected cash flows,
    discount rates, credit ratings, workout periods, and overall
    capital market liquidity. These assumptions, assessments and the
    interpretations of relevant market data are subject to
    uncertainties, are difficult to predict and require significant
    judgment. The use of different assumptions, or applying
    different judgments to inherently subjective matters and changes
    in future market conditions could result in significantly
    different estimates of fair value. There is no assurance as to
    when the market for auction rate securities will stabilize. The
    fair value of our ARS could change significantly based on market
    conditions and continued uncertainties in the credit markets. If
    these uncertainties continue or if these securities experience
    credit rating downgrades, we may incur additional temporary
    impairment related to our auction rate securities portfolio. We
    will continue to monitor the fair value of our ARS and relevant
    market conditions and will record additional temporary or

other-than-temporary

impairments if future circumstances warrant such charges.

As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers, which
    occurred during fiscal 2009, we recorded an

other-than-temporary

impairment charge of $11.8 million on our corporate bonds
    related to investments in Lehman Brothers securities and
    approximately $9.3 million on our investments in the
    Primary Fund that held Lehman Brothers investments. During
    fiscal 2010, we sold our remaining holdings of Lehman Brothers
    bonds and the Primary Fund made multiple distributions of its
    assets to its investors, and as of April 30, 2010, we
    recovered our recorded investment, with the exception of
    $0.2 million, for which we recognized an additional loss.
    As of April 30, 2010, we no longer had any direct or
    indirect investments related to Lehman Brothers and have
    recognized all related losses in our statement of operations.

During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, recognized gains and losses
    on

available-for-sale

investments were not material. Management determines the
    appropriate classification of investments at the time of
    purchase and reevaluates the classification at each reporting
    date. The fair value of our marketable securities, including
    those included in cash equivalents and long-term investments,
    was $3,605.2 million and $2,596.6 million as of
    April 30, 2010 and April 24, 2009, respectively.

To determine the fair value of nonmarketable investments, we use
    the most recent information available to us, including new
    financings or estimates of current fair value, as well as
    through traditional valuation techniques. It is our policy to
    review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to
    determine whether the investments in these companies are

other-than-temporarily

impaired. In the case of privately-held companies, this
    evaluation is based on information that we request from these
    companies. If we believe the carrying value of an investment is
    in excess of fair value, and this difference is

other-than-temporary,

it is our policy to write down the investment to fair value. The
    carrying value of our investments in privately-held companies
    was $1.4 million and $3.9 million as of April 30,
    2010 and April 24, 2009, respectively. During fiscal 2010
    and 2009, we recorded $3.4 million of gains and
    $6.3 million of net impairment charges in our consolidated
    statements of operations, respectively, for our investments in
    privately-held companies, and adjusted the carrying amount of
    those investments to fair value, as we deemed the decline in the
    value of these assets to be

other-than-temporary.

Income
    Taxes

The determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments
    and estimates due to the complexity of the tax law that we are
    subject to in several tax jurisdictions. Earnings derived from
    our international business are generally taxed at rates that are
    lower than U.S. rates, resulting in a lower effective tax
    rate than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0%. The ability
    to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent on
    existing tax laws in both the United States and the
    respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are
    located. Future changes in domestic or international tax laws
    could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we
    are currently receiving. In addition, a decrease in the
    percentage of our total earnings from international business or
    a change in the mix of international business among particular
    tax jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate.



We account for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets
    and liabilities for the effect of temporary differences between
    the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
    reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
    We reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is
    more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset
    will not be realized. Tax attributes related to the exercise of
    employee stock options are not realized until they result in a
    reduction of taxes payable. We do not include unrealized stock
    option attributes as components of our gross deferred tax assets
    and corresponding valuation allowance disclosures.

We have provided a valuation allowance of $28.3 million as
    of April 30, 2010, compared to $28.0 million as of
    April 24, 2009 and $28.6 million as of April 25,
    2008, on certain of our deferred tax assets. The changes in
    valuation allowance in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were primarily
    related to changes in the blended state tax rates. The tax
    effected amounts of gross unrealized net operating loss and
    business tax credit carryforwards, net of their corresponding
    valuation allowance at April 30, 2010 are
    $358.6 million.

We recognize tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions by
    applying a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
    the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We
    recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions
    on income tax returns based on a two-step process. The first
    step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that
    each income tax position would be sustained upon audit. The
    second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the
    amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
    upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority. Estimating
    these amounts requires us to determine the probability of
    various possible outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax
    positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on the
    consideration of several factors, including changes in facts or
    circumstances, changes in applicable tax law, settlement of
    issues under audit and new exposures. If we later determine that
    our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to
    cover our revised expectations, we adjust the liability and
    effect a related change in our tax provision during the period
    in which we make such determination.

Net revenues increased by $525.0 million, or 15%, in fiscal
    2010 compared to fiscal 2009 and by $103.2 million, or 3%
    in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The increase in our net
    revenues for fiscal 2010 was primarily related to an increase in
    product revenues, while the increase in fiscal 2009 was due to
    increases in software entitlements and



maintenance (SEM) and services revenues, partially offset by
    decreases in product revenues. Additionally, net revenues for
    fiscal 2009 were negatively impacted by the $128.7 million
    GSA settlement.

Sales through our indirect channels represented 69%, 69% and 63%
    of net revenues for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    The indirect channel mix for 2009 would have been 3% higher if
    not for the impact of the GSA settlement.

    increase in low-end systems, and increased by 14% in fiscal 2009
    compared to fiscal 2008, reflecting an increase in low-end
    systems, partially offset by decreases in mid-range and high-end
    systems.

During fiscal 2010, high-end, midrange and low-end systems
    generated approximately 23%, 56% and 21% of configured systems
    revenues, respectively, compared to approximately 24%, 55% and
    21%, respectively in fiscal 2009, and approximately 25%, 59% and
    16%, respectively, in fiscal 2008. Overall average selling
    prices (ASPs) declined in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009
    due primarily to a shift in mix towards low-end systems, as well
    as lower ASPs per unit in midrange and low-end systems. ASPs
    declined in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, due primarily
    to lower ASPs in all systems ranges and a shift in mix towards
    low-end systems.

In addition, our net add-on hardware, software and other product
    revenues accounted for an $88.5 million increase in fiscal
    2010 compared to fiscal 2009 and a $102.4 million increase
    in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to customers
    increasing the capacity of their storage systems.

Our systems are highly configurable to respond to customer
    requirements in the open systems storage markets that we serve.
    This wide variation in customer configurations can significantly
    impact revenues, cost of revenues, and gross profit performance.
    Price changes, unit volumes, customer mix and product
    configuration can also impact revenues, cost of revenues and
    gross profit performance. Disks are a significant component of
    our storage systems. Industry disk pricing continues to fall
    every year, and we pass along those price decreases to our
    customers while working to maintain relatively constant profit
    margins on our disk drives. While our sales price per terabyte
    continues to decline, improved system performance, increased
    capacity and software to manage this increased capacity have an
    offsetting impact on product revenues.

Sales to the United States accounted for 89%, 90% and 91% of
    Americas’ revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Revenues from the Americas geographic area increased by
    $402.9 million in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, due
    to an increase in gross revenues of $531.6 million and the
    negative impact in fiscal 2009 of the $128.7 million GSA
    settlement. Sales to Germany accounted for 11% of net revenues
    in each of fiscal 2010 and 2009, and less than 10% of net
    revenues in fiscal 2008. No other single foreign country
    accounted for ten percent or more of net revenues in any of the
    years presented.

Cost
    of Revenues

Our cost of revenues consists of three elements: (1) cost
    of product revenues, which includes the costs of manufacturing
    and shipping of our storage systems, amortization of purchased
    intangible assets, inventory write-downs, and warranty costs;
    (2) cost of software maintenance and entitlements, which
    includes the costs of providing software entitlements and
    maintenance and third party royalty costs, and (3) cost of
    service, which reflects costs



associated with providing support center activities for
    hardware, global support partnership programs, professional
    services and educational and training services.

Our gross profits are impacted by a variety of factors including
    pricing and discount practices, channel sales mix, revenue mix
    and product material costs. Service gross profit is also
    typically impacted by factors such as changes in the size of our
    installed base of products, as well as the timing of support
    service initiations and renewals, and incremental investments in
    our customer support infrastructure. If our shipment volumes,
    product and services mix, average selling prices and pricing
    actions that impact our gross profit are adversely affected,
    whether by economic uncertainties or for other reasons, our
    gross profit could decline.

Cost of product revenues decreased by $31.2 million, or 3%,
    in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of lower
    materials costs, warranty costs and demonstration equipment
    reserves, partially offset by higher unit volume. Cost of
    product revenues increased by $69.2 million, or 7%, in
    fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to increased
    materials cost as a result of increased unit volume and higher
    per unit costs in all products ranges.

The decrease in cost of product revenues in fiscal 2010 compared
    to fiscal 2009 reflected a decrease in materials costs of
    $9.9 million despite an increase in total units shipped.
    Our material costs were favorably impacted in fiscal 2010 by
    lower average per unit materials costs in our midrange and
    low-end systems due to favorable materials pricing, which we
    expect to continue. These favorable impacts were offset by
    higher unit volume and higher average per unit materials costs
    in our high-end systems. In addition, our cost of product
    revenues were favorably impacted in fiscal 2010 compared to
    fiscal 2009 as a result of a decrease of $11.3 million in
    warranty costs and $8.6 million in reserves for evaluation
    equipment due to higher than anticipated sales of such equipment
    to customers. Cost of product revenues were negatively impacted
    in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of
    approximately $9.7 million of incremental inventory
    writedowns.

Cost of product revenues represented 41% of product revenue for
    2010 compared to 47% for 2009, and 42% in fiscal 2008. The
    overall reduction of costs as a percentage of revenues in fiscal
    2010 was the result of per unit materials cost reductions
    outpacing sales price reductions. The increase in materials
    costs as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2009 reflected
    higher per unit materials costs compared to the prior year.

Operating
    Expenses

Sales and
    Marketing, Research and Development, and General and
    Administrative Expenses

Compensation costs comprise the largest component of operating
    expenses. Included in compensation costs are salaries and
    related benefits, stock-based compensation costs and employee
    incentive compensation plan costs. Compensation costs included
    in operating expenses increased approximately
    $108.6 million, or 11%, during fiscal 2010 compared to
    fiscal 2009, primarily due to (i) a $75.6 million
    increase in employee incentive compensation due to stronger
    operating profit performance, (ii) a $16.4 million
    increase in stock based compensation, and (iii) a
    $16.5 million increase in salaries, benefits and other
    compensation related costs. In addition, sales and marketing
    expenses reflected an increase in commissions expense of
    $60.7 million during fiscal 2010, reflecting stronger sales
    performance compared to fiscal 2009.

Compensation costs included in operating expenses increased
    approximately $111.4 million, or 12%, during fiscal 2009
    compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to (i) an
    $113.1 million increase in salaries, benefits and other
    compensation related costs, reflecting an increase in average
    headcount and (ii) a $7.3 million increase in employee
    incentive compensation, partially offset by a $9.0 million
    decrease in stock-based compensation expense.

Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plans —

In February
    2009, we announced our decision to execute a worldwide
    restructuring program, which included a reduction in workforce,
    the closing or downsizing of certain facilities, and the
    establishment of a plan to outsource certain internal
    activities. In December 2008, we announced our decision to cease
    the development and availability of SnapMirror for Open Systems
    (SMOS), which was originally acquired through our acquisition of
    Topio in fiscal 2007. As part of this decision, we also
    announced the closure of our engineering facility in Haifa,
    Israel. These restructuring activities resulted in restructuring
    charges in fiscal 2009 totaling $51.5 million of
    severance-related amounts and other charges attributable to the
    termination of approximately 450 regular positions, abandoned
    excess facilities, charges relating to non-cancelable lease
    costs, (which are net of expected sublease income); contract
    cancellation charges; outplacement expenses; fixed assets and
    intangibles write-offs; as well as $2.9 million of other
    charges to support our restructuring initiatives. In fiscal
    2010, we recorded additional charges of $2.5 million
    primarily related to adjustments to future lease commitments and
    employee severance costs associated with our fiscal 2009
    restructuring plan.

In recording the facility lease restructuring reserve, we made
    certain estimates and assumptions related to the (i) time
    period over which the relevant buildings would remain vacant,
    (ii) sublease terms, and (iii) sublease rates.

Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Plan —

As of
    April 30, 2010, we had $0.5 million remaining in
    facility restructuring reserves established as part of a
    restructuring in fiscal 2002 related to future lease commitments
    on exited facilities, net of expected sublease income. We
    reevaluate our estimates and assumptions periodically and make
    adjustments as necessary based on the time period over which the
    facilities will be vacant, expected sublease terms, and expected
    sublease rates.

As of April 30, 2010, the remaining balance of the
    restructuring reserve related to the fiscal 2009 and 2002
    restructuring plans consisted of approximately $4.1 million
    of facilities-related lease payments, which we expect to be
    substantially paid by January 2013.

See Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements for further discussion of our restructuring
    activities.

    Directors terminated the merger agreement and pursuant to the
    terms of the agreement, Data Domain paid us a $57.0 million
    termination fee. We incurred $15.9 million of incremental
    third-party costs relating to the terminated merger transaction
    during the same period, resulting in net proceeds of
    $41.1 million recorded in the consolidated statement of
    operations during fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2010, we paid
    $1.2 million of acquisition related expenses related to the

Interest expense increased $10.7 million for fiscal 2010

    outstanding for the full year ended April 30, 2010 but only
    a partial period in the prior year.

During fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, we recognized approximately
    $50.8 million and $41.0 million, respectively, in
    incremental non-cash interest expense from the amortization of
    debt discount and issuance costs relating to our Notes. The
    coupon interest expense related to the Notes was
    $22.5 million and $19.4 million, respectively, for
    fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009.

The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2009 compared to
    fiscal 2008 was primarily due to interest expense and
    amortization of debt issuance costs on our Notes, partially
    offset by lower interest expense related to the reduced
    outstanding balance on our secured credit agreement we entered

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 10.4%, compared to an
    effective tax benefit of 681.5% for fiscal 2009 and an effective
    tax rate of 19.1% for fiscal 2008. Our effective tax rate
    reflects our corporate legal entity structure and the global
    nature of our business with a significant amount of our profits
    generated and taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates below the
    U.S. statutory tax rate. The effective tax rate for fiscal
    2010 was favorably impacted by the geographic mix of profits.
    The tax benefit rate for fiscal 2009 reflected losses generated
    in the U.S. during that period that were partially offset
    by profits generated in foreign tax jurisdictions where the tax
    rates were below the U.S. statutory rate.

The effective tax rate of 10.4% in fiscal 2010 included a
    benefit of $105.3 million, or 23.5 percentage points,
    related to foreign income tax rates that are lower than the
    U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%, a benefit of
    $7.8 million, or 1.7 percentage points, related to
    research and development tax credits, a benefit of
    $2.6 million, or 0.6 percentages points, related to
    stock-based compensation, partially offset by the unfavorable
    impact of $2.6 million, or 0.6 percentage points,
    related to state income taxes.

The effective tax benefit of 681.5% for fiscal 2009 included the
    benefit of $51.0 million, or 616.8 percentage points,
    related to foreign income tax rates that are lower than the
    U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%, a benefit of
    $9.2 million, or 111.1 percentage points, related to
    research and development tax credits, a benefit of
    $7.9 million, or 95.5 percentage points, related to
    state income taxes, partially offset by the unfavorable impact
    of $10.2 million, or 122.9 percentage points, related
    to stock-based compensation.

The effective tax rate of 19.1% for fiscal 2008 included a
    benefit of $67.6 million, or 17.7 percentage points,
    related to foreign income tax rates that are lower than the
    U.S. federal statutory rate, a benefit of
    $4.7 million, or 1.2 percentage points, related to
    research and development tax credits, partially offset by the
    unfavorable impact of $11.02 million, or
    2.9 percentages points, related to stock-based
    compensation, and $2.2 million, or 0.6 percentage
    points, related to state income taxes.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The following sections discuss our principal liquidity
    requirements, as well as our sources and uses of cash flows on
    our liquidity and capital resources. The principal objectives of
    our investment policy are the preservation of principal and
    maintenance of liquidity. We attempt to mitigate default risk by
    investing in high-quality investment grade securities, limiting
    the time to maturity and by monitoring the counter-parties and
    underlying obligors closely. We believe our cash equivalents and
    short-term investments are liquid and accessible. We are not
    aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our
    cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of
    April 30, 2010.



Liquidity
    Sources, Cash Requirements

Our principal sources of liquidity as of April 30, 2010
    consisted of approximately $3.7 billion in cash, cash
    equivalents and short-term investments and cash we expect to
    generate from operations.

Cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following:

Total cash, cash equivalents and investments

$

Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our
    working capital needs, support ongoing business activities,
    research and development, capital expenditure needs, investment
    in critical or complementary technologies, and to service our
    debt and synthetic leases.

Key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in
    our revenue mix and profitability, as well as our ability to
    effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts
    receivable and inventories. Based on our current business
    outlook, we believe that our sources of cash will satisfy our
    working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment
    requirements, stock repurchases, contractual obligations,
    commitments, interest payments on our Notes and other liquidity
    requirements associated with operations and meet our cash
    requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, in
    the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to
    further curtail spending and implement additional cost saving
    measures and restructuring actions. In light of the current
    economic and market conditions, we cannot be certain that we
    will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels
    or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if
    necessary, on satisfactory terms, if at all.

Our contractual obligations as of April 30, 2010 are
    summarized below in the Contractual Obligations tables.

Our investment portfolio, including auction rate securities has
    been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to
    trends in the credit and capital markets. However, we are not
    dependent on liquidating these investments in the next twelve
    months in order to meet our liquidity needs. We continue to
    closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize
    our market risk on our investment portfolio. Based on our
    ability to access our cash and short-term investments, our
    expected operating cash flows, and our other potential sources
    of cash, we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity of
    these investments will impact our ability to fund working
    capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other cash
    requirements. We intend to and believe that we have the ability
    to hold these investments until the market recovers. If current
    market conditions deteriorate, we may be required to record
    additional charges to earnings in future periods.

Capital
    Expenditure Requirements

We expect to fund our capital expenditures, including our
    commitments related to facilities and equipment operating
    leases, over the next few years through existing cash, cash
    equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations. The
    timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be
    precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of
    factors including future demand for products, product mix,
    changes in the network storage industry, hiring plans and our
    decisions related to financing our facilities requirement. We
    expect that our existing facilities and those being developed in
    Sunnyvale, California; RTP, North Carolina; and worldwide are
    adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years
    and that additional space will be available as needed.

Acquisition
    Related Requirements

On April 6, 2010, we entered into a definitive agreement to
    acquire Bycast Inc. for approximately $80 million in cash.
    The merger was completed on May 13, 2010.



Cash
    Flows

As of April 30, 2010, compared to April 24, 2009, our
    cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments increased
    by $1.1 billion to $3.7 billion. The increase in cash
    and cash equivalents and short-term investments was primarily a
    result of cash provided by operating activities and issuances of
    common stock related to employee stock option exercises and
    employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by capital
    expenditures. We derive our liquidity and capital resources
    primarily from our cash flow from operations and from working
    capital. Days sales outstanding as of April 30, 2010
    decreased to 37 days, compared to 46 days as of
    April 24, 2009, primarily due to improvements in shipment
    linearity and collections performance. Working capital increased
    by $0.9 billion to $2.6 billion as of April 30,
    2010, compared to $1.8 billion as of April 24, 2009,
    primarily due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and
    short-term investments of $1.1 billion.

Cash
    Flows from Operating Activities

During fiscal 2010 and 2009, we generated cash flows from
    operating activities of $975.0 million and
    $889.2 million, respectively. The primary sources of cash
    from operations in fiscal 2010 consisted of net income of
    $400.4 million, adjusted by non-cash stock-based
    compensation expense of $159.8 million and depreciation and
    amortization expense of $166.0 million. Significant changes
    in assets and liabilities impacting operating cash flows in
    fiscal 2010 included an increase in deferred revenue of
    $176.7 million, and an increase in accrued compensation and
    other current liabilities of $53.2 million. The primary
    sources of cash from operations in fiscal 2009 consisted of net
    income of $64.6 million, adjusted by non-cash stock-based
    compensation expense of $140.8 million, depreciation and
    amortization expense of $170.5 million and a deferred tax
    provision of $124.6 million. Significant changes in assets
    and liabilities impacting operating cash flows in fiscal 2009
    included a decrease in accounts receivable of
    $128.7 million, an increase in deferred revenue of
    $219.3 million, and an increase in other current
    liabilities of $128.7 million related to the GSA settlement.

We expect that cash provided by operating activities may
    fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors,
    including fluctuations in our operating results, shipment
    linearity, accounts receivable collections performance,
    inventory and supply chain management, tax benefits from
    stock-based compensation, and the timing and amount of
    compensation and other payments.

Cash
    Flows from Investing Activities

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 were $135.6 million,
    which included the purchase of fifteen acres of land in
    Bangalore, India for approximately $28.5 million, compared
    to $289.6 million in fiscal 2009. We paid
    $860.3 million for net purchases and redemptions of
    short-term investments in fiscal 2010, compared to
    $116.8 million in fiscal 2009. In addition, in fiscal 2009
    we reclassified $598.0 million of cash equivalents related
    to the Primary Fund to short-term investments.

Cash
    Flows from Financing Activities

We received $219.9 million and $696.6 million from
    financing activities in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    Proceeds from employee equity award plans, net of shares
    withheld for taxes were $197.1 million in fiscal 2010,
    compared to $85.9 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010,
    we received $14.2 million from the settlement of a Note
    hedge with Lehman Brothers. In fiscal 2009, we issued
    $1.265 billion of convertible notes, received proceeds of
    $163.1 million for sale of related common stock warrants,
    and paid $254.9 million for purchase of related note
    hedges, made repayments of $172.6 million against our
    Secured Credit Agreement and the Term Loan and repurchased
    17.0 million shares of common stock for a total of
    $400.0 million.

Net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to
    employee participation in employee equity award programs have
    historically been a significant component of our liquidity. The
    extent to which our employees exercise stock options or
    participate in our ESPP program generally increases or decreases
    based upon changes in the market price of our common stock. As a
    result, our cash flow resulting from the issuance of common
    stock in connection with these programs and related tax benefits
    will vary.



Stock
    Repurchase Program

At April 30, 2010, $1.1 billion remained available for
    future repurchases under plans approved as of that date. The
    stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any
    time.

Convertible
    Notes

As of April 30, 2010, we had $1.265 billion principal
    amount of 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (See
    Note 10 of the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements). The Notes will mature on June 1, 2013, unless
    earlier repurchased or converted. As of April 30, 2010, the
    Notes have not been repurchased or converted. We also have not
    received any shares under the related Note hedges or delivered
    cash or shares under the related warrants.

Credit
    Facility

Effective December 22, 2009, we terminated our senior
    unsecured credit agreement as further discussed in Note 10
    of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contractual
    Obligations

The following summarizes our contractual obligations at
    April 30, 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected
    to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in
    millions):

Some of the figures we include in this table are based on
    management’s estimates and assumptions about these
    obligations, including their duration, the possibility of
    renewal or termination, anticipated actions by management and
    third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and
    assumptions are necessarily subjective, our actual future
    obligations may vary from those reflected in the table.

(1)

Included in real estate lease payments pursuant to four
    financing arrangements with BNP Paribas LLC (BNPPLC) are
    (i) lease commitments of $3.6 million in each of the
    fiscal years 2011 and 2012; and $2.4 million in fiscal
    2013, which are based on either the LIBOR rate at April 30,
    2010 plus a spread or a fixed rate for terms of five years, and
    (ii) at the expiration or termination of the lease, a
    supplemental payment obligation equal to our minimum guarantee
    of $127.1 million in the event that we elect not to
    purchase or arrange for sale of the buildings.

(2)

Contract manufacturer commitments consist of obligations for on
    hand inventories and non-cancelable purchase order with our
    contract manufacturer. We record a liability for firm,
    noncancelable, and nonreturnable



As of April 30, 2010, we have four leasing arrangements
    (Leasing Arrangements 1, 2, 3 and 4) with BNPPLC which
    requires us to lease certain of our land to BNPPLC for a period
    of 99 years and to lease approximately 0.6 million
    square feet of office space for our headquarters in Sunnyvale,
    which had an original cost of $149.6 million. Under these
    leasing arrangements, we pay BNPPLC minimum lease payments,
    which vary based on LIBOR plus a spread or a fixed rate on the
    costs of the facilities on the respective lease commencement
    dates. We make payments for each of the leases for a term of
    five years. We have the option to renew each of the leases for
    two consecutive five-year periods upon approval by BNPPLC. Upon
    expiration (or upon any earlier termination) of the lease terms,
    we must elect one of the following options: (i) purchase
    the buildings from BNPPLC at cost; (ii) if certain
    conditions are met, arrange for the sale of the buildings by
    BNPPLC to a third party for an amount equal to at least 85% of
    the costs (residual guarantee), and be liable for any deficiency
    between the net proceeds received from the third party and such
    amounts; or (iii) pay BNPPLC supplemental payments for an
    amount equal to at least 85% of the costs (residual guarantee),
    in which event we may recoup some or all of such payments by
    arranging for a sale of each or all buildings by BNPPLC during
    the ensuing two-year period. The following table summarizes the
    costs, the residual guarantee, the applicable LIBOR plus spread
    or fixed rate at April 30, 2010 and the date we began to
    make payments for each of our leasing arrangements (in millions):

All leases require us to maintain specified financial covenants
    with which we were in compliance as of April 30, 2010. Such
    financial covenants include a maximum ratio of Total Debt to
    Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization
    and a minimum amount of Unencumbered Cash and Short-Term
    Investments. Our failure to comply with these financial
    covenants could result in a default under the leases which,
    subject to our right and ability to exercise our purchase
    option, would give BNPPLC the right to, among other things,
    (i) terminate our possession of the leased property and
    require us to pay lease termination damages and other amounts as
    set forth in the lease agreements, or (ii) exercise certain
    foreclosure remedies. If we were to exercise our purchase
    option, or be required to pay lease termination damages, these
    payments would significantly reduce our available liquidity,
    which could constrain our operating flexibility.

As of April 30, 2010, we estimated that the fair value of
    the properties under synthetic lease was $36.9 million less
    than their aggregate residual guarantees. We are accruing for
    this deficiency over the remaining terms of the respective
    leases.



We may from time to time terminate one or more of our leasing
    arrangements and repay amounts outstanding in order to meet our
    operating or other objectives.

Legal
    Contingencies

On September 5, 2007, we filed a patent infringement
    lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory
    damages and a permanent injunction against Sun Microsystems. On
    October 25, 2007, Sun Microsystems filed a counter
    claim against us in the Eastern District of Texas seeking
    compensatory damages and a permanent injunction. On
    October 29, 2007, Sun filed a second lawsuit against us in
    the Northern District of California asserting additional patents
    against us. The Texas court granted a joint motion to transfer
    the Texas lawsuit to the Northern District of California on
    November 26, 2007. On March 26, 2008, Sun filed a
    third lawsuit in federal court that extends the patent
    infringement charges to storage management technology we
    acquired in January 2008. In January 2010, Oracle acquired Sun.
    The three lawsuits are currently in the discovery and motion
    phase and no trial dates have been set, so we are unable at this
    time to determine the likely outcome of these various patent
    litigations. In addition, as we are unable to reasonably
    estimate the amount or range of the potential settlement, no
    accrual has been recorded as of April 30, 2010.

In addition, we are subject to various legal proceedings and
    claims which have arisen or may arise in the normal course of
    business. While the outcome of these legal matters is currently
    not determinable, we do not believe that any current litigation
    or claims will have a material adverse effect on our business,
    cash flow, operating results, or financial condition.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

During the ordinary course of business, we provide standby
    letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third
    parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by
    us or our subsidiaries. As of April 30, 2010, our financial
    guarantees of $5.1 million that were not recorded on our
    balance sheet consisted of standby letters of credit related to
    workers’ compensation, a customs guarantee, a corporate
    credit card program, foreign rent guarantees and surety bonds,
    which were primarily related to self-insurance.

We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign
    currency risk. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is
    to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated
    with changes in foreign currency. The program is not designated
    for trading or speculative purposes. Currently, we do not enter
    into any foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures
    related to firm commitments or nonmarketable investments. Our
    major foreign currency exchange exposures and related hedging
    programs are described below:

•

We utilize monthly foreign currency forward and options
    contracts to hedge exchange rate fluctuations related to certain
    foreign monetary assets and liabilities.

•

We use currency forward contracts to hedge exposures related to
    forecasted sales denominated in certain foreign currencies.
    These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and in
    general closely match the underlying forecasted transactions in
    duration.

As of April 30, 2010, our notional fair value of foreign
    exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled
    $484.2 million. We do not believe that these derivatives
    present significant credit risks, because of the short term
    maturity of the outstanding contracts at any point in time, the
    counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial
    institutions, and we manage the notional amount of contracts
    entered into with any one counterparty. Other than the risk
    associated with the financial condition of the counterparties,
    our maximum exposure related to foreign currency forward and
    option contracts is limited to the premiums paid. See
    Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements for more information related to our hedging
    activities.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into recourse lease
    financing arrangements with third-party leasing companies and
    from time to time provide guarantees for a portion of other
    financing arrangements under which we could be called upon to
    make payments to the third-party funding companies in the event
    of nonpayment by end-user customers. See Note 18 of the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements for more
    information related to these financing arrangements.



We enter into indemnification agreements with third parties in
    the ordinary course of business. Generally, these
    indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses
    suffered by the third party due to various events, such as
    lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement. These
    indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet
    arrangements under accounting guidance.

We have commitments related to four lease arrangements with
    BNPPLC for approximately 0.6 million square feet of office
    space for our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California (as further
    described above under “Contractual Obligations”).

We have evaluated our accounting for these leases as required by
    guidance on accounting for variable interest entities and have
    determined the following:

•

BNPPLC is a leasing company for BNP Paribas in the United
    States. BNPPLC is not a “special purpose entity”
    organized for the sole purpose of facilitating the leases to us.
    The obligation to absorb expected losses and receive expected
    residual returns rests with the parent, BNP Paribas. Therefore,
    we are not the primary beneficiary of BNPPLC as we do not absorb
    the majority of BNPPLC’s expected losses or expected
    residual returns; and

•

BNPPLC has represented in the related closing agreements that
    the fair value of the property leased to us by BNPPLC is less
    than half of the total of the fair values of all assets of
    BNPPLC, excluding any assets of BNPPLC held within a silo.
    Further, the property leased to NetApp is not held within a
    silo. The definition of “held within a silo” means
    that BNPPLC has obtained funds equal to or in excess of 95% of
    the fair value of the leased asset to acquire or maintain its
    investment in such asset through nonrecourse financing or other
    contractual arrangements, the effect of which is to leave such
    asset (or proceeds thereof) as the only significant asset of
    BNPPLC at risk for the repayment of such funds.

Accordingly, under current accounting guidance, we are not
    required to consolidate either the leasing entity or the
    specific assets that we lease under the BNPPLC lease. Our future
    minimum lease payments and residual guarantees under these real
    estate leases will amount to a total of $136.7 million as
    discussed in above in “Contractual Obligations”.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in
    interest rates, market prices, and foreign currency exchange
    rates. We use certain derivative financial instruments to manage
    these risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for
    speculative or trading purposes. All financial instruments are
    used in accordance with management-approved policies.

Market
    Risk and Market Interest Risk

Investment and Interest Income

— As of
    April 30, 2010, we had

available-for-sale

investments of $2.1 billion. Our investment portfolio
    primarily consists of investments with original maturities at
    the date of purchase of greater than three months, which are
    classified as

available-for-sale.

These investments, consisting primarily of corporate bonds,
    commercial paper, U.S. government agency bonds,
    U.S. Treasuries, and certificates of deposit, are subject
    to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in
    value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical
    10 percent increase in market interest rates from levels at
    April 30, 2010 would cause the fair value of these

available-for-sale

investments to decline by approximately $3.6 million.
    Volatility in market interest rates over time will cause
    variability in our interest income. We do not use derivative
    financial instruments in our investment portfolio.

Our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through
    diversification and investment in highly rated securities. We
    further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our
    investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities
    of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies
    and type of issuer. We actively review, along with our
    investment advisors, current investment ratings, company
    specific events and general economic conditions in managing our
    investments and in determining whether there is a significant
    decline in fair value that is

other-than-temporary.

We will monitor and evaluate the accounting for our investment
    portfolio on a quarterly basis for additional

other-than-temporary

impairment charges.



We are also exposed to market risk relating to our auction rate
    securities due to uncertainties in the credit and capital
    markets. As of April 30, 2010, we recorded cumulative
    unrealized loss of $3.3 million, offset by
    $0.7 million of unrealized gains related to these
    securities. The fair value of our auction rate securities may
    change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit
    and capital markets. These securities/issuers could be subject
    to review for possible downgrade. Any downgrade in these credit
    ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated
    fair value of our auction rate securities. Changes in the
    various assumptions used to value these securities and any
    increase in the markets’ perceived risk associated with
    such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair
    value.

If current market conditions deteriorate, or the anticipated
    recovery in market values does not occur, we may be required to
    record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive
    income (loss) or

other-than-temporary

impairment charges to earnings in future quarters. We intend,
    and have the ability, to hold these investments until the market
    recovers. We do not believe that the lack of liquidity relating
    to our portfolio investments will impact our ability to fund
    working capital needs, capital expenditures or other operating
    requirements. See Note 9 of the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8;
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital
    Resources,” in Part II, Item 7; and Risk Factors
    in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for a description of recent market events that may affect the
    value and liquidity of the investments in our portfolio that we
    held at April 30, 2010.

Lease Commitments

— As of April 30, 2010,
    one of our four lease arrangements with BNPPLC is based on a
    floating interest rate. The minimum lease payments will vary
    based on LIBOR plus a spread. All of our leases have an initial
    term of five years, and we have the option to renew these leases
    for two consecutive five-year periods upon approval by BNPPLC. A
    hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rate
    from the level at April 30, 2010 would increase our lease
    payments on this one floating lease arrangement under the
    initial five-year term by an immaterial amount. We do not
    currently hedge against market interest rate increases.

Convertible Notes

— In June 2008, we issued
    $1.265 billion principal amount of 1.75% Notes due
    2013, of which $1.017 billion was allocated to debt and
    $0.248 billion was allocated to equity. Holders may convert
    the Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain
    circumstances, including, but not limited to:

•

during the five business day period after any five consecutive
    trading day period in which the trading price of the Notes for
    each day in this five consecutive trading day period was less
    than 98% of an amount equal to (i) the last reported sale
    price of our common stock multiplied by (ii) the conversion
    rate on such day;

•

during any calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of
    our common stock for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30
    consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the
    immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the
    applicable conversion price in effect for the Notes on the last
    trading day of such immediately preceding calendar
    quarter; or

•

upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions under
    the indenture for the Notes.

The Notes are convertible into the right to receive cash in an
    amount up to the principal amount and shares of our common stock
    for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, if
    any, at an initial conversion rate of 31.4006 shares of
    common stock per one thousand principal amount of Notes, subject
    to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the Notes,
    which represents an initial conversion price of $31.85 per share.

Upon conversion, a holder will receive cash in an amount equal
    to the lesser of the conversion value and the principal amount
    of the Notes, and any shares of our common stock for any
    conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the Notes.
    Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into
    convertible note hedge transactions and separately, warrant
    transactions, to reduce the potential dilution from the
    conversion of the Notes and to mitigate any negative effect such
    conversion may have on the price of our common stock. In fiscal
    2010, we terminated the hedge transaction with a counterparty to
    20% of our Note hedges, and because we have decided not to
    replace the hedge, we are subject to potential dilution on the
    20% unhedged portion of our Notes upon conversion if on the date
    of conversion the per-share market price of our common stock
    exceeds the conversion price of $31.85.



As of April 30, 2010, none of the conditions allowing the
    holders of the Notes to convert had been met and we had not
    issued any shares related to the Notes. Based on the closing
    price of our common stock of $34.67 on April 30, 2010, the
    if-converted value of our Notes exceeded their principal amount
    by approximately $112 million.

The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk,
    market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature.
    Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest
    rates fall

and/or

our
    common stock price increases, and decrease as interest rates
    rise

and/or

our common stock price decreases. The interest and market value
    changes affect the fair value of our Notes, but do not impact
    our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due
    to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the
    Notes at fair value, but present the fair value of the principal
    amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes. As of
    April 30, 2010, the principal amount of our Notes, which
    consists of the combined debt and equity components, was
    $1.265 billion, and the total estimated fair value of such
    was $1.5 billion based on the closing trading price of $120
    per $100 of our Notes as of that date.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward
    Contracts

We hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to
    minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates on earnings. We utilize forward and option contracts to
    hedge against the short-term impact of foreign currency
    fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in
    foreign currencies. All balance sheet hedges are marked to
    market through earnings every period. We also use foreign
    exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted
    transactions related to forecasted sales transactions. These
    derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under accounting
    guidance for derivatives and hedging. For cash flow hedges
    outstanding at April 30, 2010, the time-value component is
    recorded in earnings while all other gains or losses were
    included in other comprehensive income.

We do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative
    or trading purposes. In entering into forward and option foreign
    exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise
    from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms
    of their contracts. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit
    risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy
    multinational commercial banks. All contracts have a maturity of
    less than one year.

The following table provides information about our currency
    forward contracts outstanding on April 30, 2010 and
    April 24, 2009 (in millions):

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

NetApp, Inc.

Sunnyvale, California

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    NetApp, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, the
    “Company”) as of April 30, 2010 and
    April 24, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of
    operations, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period
    ended April 30, 2010. Our audits also included the
    financial statement schedule listed in Item 15. These
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
    Company as of April 30, 2010 and April 24, 2009, and
    the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended April 30, 2010, in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
    statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
    consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
    fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
    therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    April 30, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated June 18, 2010 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Fiscal Year

— We operate on a 52-week or
    53-week year ending on the last Friday in April. Fiscal 2010 was
    a 53-week fiscal year and fiscal 2009 and 2008 were 52-week
    fiscal years.

Basis of Presentation

— The consolidated
    financial statements include the Company and its wholly-owned
    subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions are
    eliminated in consolidation.

Financial Statements Presentation

— Certain
    prior period amounts have been combined in the accompanying
    financial statements to conform to current year presentation.

Retrospective Application of Accounting Standard to
    Previously Issued Financial Statements

— In May
    2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
    updated guidance which required that the liability and equity
    components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled
    in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) be
    separately accounted for in a manner that reflects an
    issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. The guidance
    applied to the $1.265 billion aggregate principal amount of
    1.75% Convertible Senior Notes (the Notes) and was adopted
    by us on a retrospective basis as of April 24, 2009 and for
    the fiscal year then ended.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of the
    consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America
    (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates
    include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, reserve
    and allowances; inventory valuation and purchase order accruals;
    valuation of goodwill and intangibles; restructuring reserves;
    product warranties; self-insurance; stock-based compensation;
    loss contingencies; investment impairments; income taxes, and
    fair value measurements. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

Financial Instruments

— For certain financial
    instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term
    investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other
    current liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate their fair
    value due to the relatively short maturity of these balances.
    The following methods were used to estimate the fair value of
    each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable
    to estimate that value:

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— We consider all
    highly liquid debt investments with original maturities of three
    months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash
    equivalents consist primarily of money market funds, for which
    the carrying amounts are reasonable estimates of fair value.
    Cash equivalents are recognized at fair value.

Short-Term Investments.

Short-term investments
    consist of marketable debt or equity securities which are
    classified as

available-for-sale

and are recognized at fair value. The determination of fair
    value is further detailed in Note 9 of the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements. We regularly review our
    investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that
    have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in
    determining whether a loss is

other-than-temporary

include: the length of time and extent to which the fair market
    value has been lower than the cost basis, the financial
    condition and near-term prospects of the investee, credit
    quality, likelihood of recovery, and our intent and ability to
    hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for
    any anticipated



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

recovery in fair market value. We classify our investments as
    current or noncurrent based on the nature of the investments and
    their availability for use in current operations.

Unrealized gains and temporary losses, net of related taxes, are
    included with accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
    (AOCI). Upon realization, those amounts are reclassified from
    AOCI to results of operations. The amortization of premiums and
    discounts on the investments and realized gains and losses
    related to investments are included in results of operations.

Other-than-temporary

impairments on

available-for-sale

debt securities are determined to be either credit losses or
    losses due to other factors. Credit losses are recognized in our
    results of operations and other losses are included in AOCI.

Investments in Privately-held Companies

— We
    have certain investments in privately-held companies, which we
    account for under the cost method, subject to periodic reviews
    for impairment.

Fair Value Measurements and Impairments

— All
    of our

available-for-sale

investments and nonmarketable equity securities are subject to a
    periodic impairment review. Investments are considered to be
    impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be

other-than-temporary.

This determination requires significant judgment.

For publicly traded investments, impairment is determined based
    upon the specific facts and circumstances present at the time,
    including factors such as current economic and market
    conditions, the credit rating of the security’s issuer, the
    length of time an investment’s fair value has been below
    our carrying value, the extent to which fair value was below
    cost, and our ability and intent to hold investments for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in
    value. If an investment’s decline in fair value, caused by
    factors other than changes in interest rates, is deemed to be

other-than-temporary,

we reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value, as
    determined based on quoted market prices or liquidation values.
    Declines in value judged to be

other-than-temporary,

if any, are recorded in operations as incurred.

For long-term investments, such as auction rate securities,
    impairment is determined based on fair value and marketability
    of these investments. The valuation models we used to estimate
    fair value included numerous assumptions such as assessments of
    the underlying structure of each security, expected cash flows,
    discount rates, credit ratings, workout periods, and overall
    capital market liquidity.

For nonmarketable investments, impairment is based on the most
    recent information available to us, including new financings or
    estimates of current fair value, as well as through traditional
    valuation techniques. It is our policy to review the fair value
    of these investments on a regular basis to determine whether the
    investments in these companies are

other-than-temporarily

impaired. In the case of privately-held companies, this
    evaluation is based on information that we request from these
    companies. If we believe the carrying value of an investment is
    in excess of fair value, and this difference is

other-than-temporary,

it is our policy to write down the investment to fair value.

Inventories

— Inventories are stated at the
    lower of cost or market, which approximates actual cost on a

first-in,

first out basis. We write down for excess and obsolete inventory
    based on the difference between the cost of inventory and the
    estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future demand
    and market conditions. In addition, we record a liability for
    firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with
    contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of
    our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of
    excess and obsolete inventory.



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Property and Equipment

— Property and equipment
    are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization is computed
    using the straight-line method, generally over the following
    periods:

Depreciation Life (years)

Buildings

40 years

Building improvements

10 years

Furniture and fixtures

5 years

Computer, production, engineering, and other equipment and
    purchased software

3 to 5 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of remaining lease term or useful life

Construction in progress will be amortized over the estimated
    useful lives of the respective assets when they are ready for
    their intended use.

Software Development Costs

— The costs for the
    development of new software products and substantial
    enhancements to existing software products are expensed as
    incurred until technological feasibility has been established,
    at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in
    accordance with the accounting guidance for software. Because
    our current process for developing software is essentially
    completed concurrently with the establishment of technological
    feasibility, which occurs upon the completion of a working
    model, no costs have been capitalized for any of the periods
    presented.

Sales and Value Added Taxes

— Taxes collected
    from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are
    presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations.

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets —

Goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for an
    acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and
    intangible assets acquired. Acquisition-related intangible
    assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
    economic lives of five years for patents, four to five years for
    existing technology, two to eight years for customer
    relationships and two to seven years for trademarks and
    tradenames as we believe this method would most closely reflect
    the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets will be
    consumed.

Goodwill is measured and tested for impairment on an annual
    basis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more
    frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist.
    Triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such
    as adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions,
    lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in
    our market capitalization. The performance of the test involves
    a two-step process. The first step requires comparing the fair
    value of the each of our reporting units to its net book value,
    including goodwill. We have three reporting units, the fair
    value of which is determined based on an allocation of our
    entity level market capitalization, as determined through quoted
    market prices. A potential impairment exists if the fair value
    of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value. The
    second step of the process is only performed if a potential
    impairment exists, and it involves determining the difference
    between the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets
    other than goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit and
    if the difference is less than the net book value of goodwill,
    an impairment exists and is recorded. We have not been required
    to perform this second step of the process because the fair
    value of our reporting units has exceeded the net book value at
    every measurement date.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets —

We review the
    carrying values of long-lived assets whenever events and
    circumstances, such as reductions in demand, lower projections
    of profitability, significant changes in the manner of our use
    of acquired assets, or significant negative industry or economic
    trends, indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be
    recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and
    eventual disposition. If this review indicates that there is an
    impairment, the impaired asset is written down to its fair
    value, which is typically calculated using: (i) quoted
    market prices

and/or

(ii) discounted expected future cash flows utilizing a
    discount rate. Our estimates regarding future anticipated net
    revenue and cash flows, the remaining economic life of the
    products and technologies, or both, may differ from those used
    to assess the recoverability of assets. In that event,
    impairment



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

charges or shortened useful lives of certain long-lived assets
    may be required, resulting in a reduction in net income or an
    increase to net loss in the period when such determinations are
    made.

Derivative Instruments

— Derivatives that are
    not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through
    earnings. If the derivative is designated as a hedge, depending
    on the nature of the exposure being hedged, changes in fair
    value will either be offset against the change in fair value of
    the hedged items through earnings or recognized in AOCI until
    the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective
    portion of the hedge is recognized in earnings immediately.

As a result of our significant international operations, we are
    subject to risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates. We
    use derivative financial instruments, principally currency
    forward contracts and currency options, to attempt to minimize
    the impact of exchange rate movements on our balance sheet and
    operating results. Factors that could have an impact on the
    effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of
    forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets. These
    programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the
    impact of currency exchange movements. The maturities of these
    instruments are generally less than one year.

Currently, we do not enter into any foreign exchange forward
    contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments or
    nonmarketable investments. Cash flows from our derivative
    programs are included under operating activities in the
    consolidated statement of cash flows with the exception of cash
    flows from the derivatives used to hedge the convertible notes
    issued June 10, 2008. The cash flows related to the Note
    hedges are included under financing activities.

Residual Guarantees

— We record
    liabilities in other accrued liabilities for the fair value of
    residual guarantees relating to certain properties under our
    synthetic leases. In the event that the fair values of the
    properties, as determined by appraisals, are below the residual
    guarantees, we accrue for the deficiencies over the remaining
    term of the respective leases.

Revenue Recognition

— We apply the provisions
    of the accounting guidance for software revenue recognition to
    our product sales, both hardware and software, because our
    software is essential to the performance of our hardware. We
    recognize revenue when:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists:

It is our customary practice to have a
    purchase order

and/or

contract prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement from our
    end users, customers, value-added resellers, or distributors.

•

Delivery has occurred:

Our product is
    physically delivered to our customers, generally with standard
    transfer terms such as FOB origin. We typically do not allow for
    restocking rights with any of our value- added resellers or
    distributors. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or
    return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria
    are achieved. If undelivered products or services exist that are
    essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an
    arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred.

•

The fee is fixed or determinable:

Arrangements
    with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms,
    conditions and practices are not considered to be fixed or
    determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized at
    the earlier of customer payment or when the fees become due and
    payable. We typically do not allow for price-protection rights
    with any of our value-added resellers or distributors.

•

Collection is probable:

If there is
    considerable doubt surrounding the credit worthiness of a
    customer at the outset of an arrangement, the associated revenue
    is deferred and recognized upon cash receipt.

Our multiple element arrangements include our systems and one or
    more of the following undelivered software-related elements:
    software entitlements and maintenance, premium hardware
    maintenance, and storage review services. Our software
    entitlements and maintenance entitle our customers to receive
    unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a

when-and-if-available

basis, bug fixes, and patch releases. Premium hardware
    maintenance services include contracts for technical support and
    minimum response times. Revenues from software



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

entitlements and maintenance, premium hardware maintenance
    services and storage review services are recognized ratably over
    the contractual term, generally from one to three years. We also
    offer extended service contracts (which extend our standard
    parts warranty and may include premium hardware maintenance) at
    the end of the warranty term; revenues from these contracts are
    recognized ratably over the contract term. We typically sell
    professional services separately from any of our other revenue
    elements, either on a time and materials basis or for fixed
    price standard projects; we recognize revenue for these services
    as they are performed. Revenue from hardware installation
    services is recognized in the period the services are delivered.
    For arrangements with multiple elements, we recognize as revenue
    the difference between the total arrangement price and the
    greater of fair value or stated price for any undelivered
    elements (“the residual method”).

For our undelivered software-related elements, we determine fair
    value of these undelivered elements based on vendor-specific
    objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value, which for
    us consists of the prices charged when these services are sold
    separately. To determine the fair value of these elements, we
    analyze both the selling prices when elements are sold
    separately as well as the concentrations of those prices. We
    believe those concentrations have been sufficient to enable us
    to establish VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements. If
    VSOE cannot be obtained to establish fair value of the
    undelivered elements, it is required that revenue from the
    entire arrangement be initially deferred and recognized ratably
    over the period these elements are delivered.

For purposes of presentation in the statement of operations,
    once fair value has been determined for our undelivered bundled
    elements, we allocate revenue first to software entitlements and
    maintenance, based on VSOE of its fair value with the remainder
    allocated to other service revenues.

We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at
    the time of shipment. Sales returns are estimated based on
    historical sales returns, current trends, and our expectations
    regarding future experience. We monitor and analyze the accuracy
    of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and
    adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of
    our current and future reserve needs. If actual future returns
    and allowances differ from past experience, additional
    allowances may be required.

Product Warranties

— Estimated future warranty
    costs are expensed as a cost of product revenues when revenue is
    recognized, based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred
    under our warranty obligations including material, distribution
    and labor costs. Our accrued liability for estimated future
    warranty costs is included in other accrued liabilities and
    other long-term obligations on the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets. Factors that affect our warranty liability
    include the number of installed units, estimated material costs,
    estimated distribution costs and estimated labor costs. We
    periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual and
    adjust the amount as considered necessary.

Foreign Currency Translation

— For subsidiaries
    whose functional currency is the local currency, gains and
    losses resulting from translation of these foreign currency
    financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in
    AOCI. For subsidiaries where the functional currency is the
    U.S. dollar, gains and losses resulting from the process of
    remeasuring foreign currency financial statements into
    U.S. dollars are included in other income (expenses), net.

Stock-Based Compensation

— We measure and
    recognize stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based
    awards, including employee stock options, restricted stock units
    and rights to purchase shares under our ESPP, based on their
    estimated fair value, and recognize the costs in our financial
    statements over the employees’ requisite service period.

The fair value of employee restricted stock units is equal to
    the market value of our common stock on the date the award is
    granted. Calculating the fair value of employee stock options
    and the rights to purchase shares under the ESPP requires
    estimates and significant judgment. The fair value of each
    option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model, and is not remeasured as a
    result of subsequent stock price fluctuations. Option-pricing
    models require the input of highly subjective assumptions,
    including the expected term of options, and the expected price
    volatility of the stock underlying such options. Our expected
    term assumption is based primarily on historical exercise and
    post-vesting forfeiture experience. Our stock price volatility
    assumption



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

is based on an implied volatility of call options and dealer
    quotes on call options, generally having a term of greater than
    twelve months. The risk-free interest rate is based upon United
    States Treasury bills with equivalent expected terms, and the
    expected dividend is based on our history and expected dividend
    payouts. Changes in the subjective assumptions required in the
    valuation models may significantly affect the estimated value of
    our stock-based awards and the related stock-based compensation
    expense. Likewise, the shortening of the contractual life of our
    options could change the estimated exercise behavior in a manner
    other than currently expected.

In addition, we estimate the number of stock-based awards that
    will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Our forfeiture
    assumption is based primarily on historical experience. Changes
    in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect
    on reported stock-based compensation expense, as the effect of
    adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture
    estimate is changed.

Income Taxes

— Deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities are provided for temporary differences that will
    result in tax deductions or income in future periods, as well as
    the future benefit of tax credit carryforwards. A valuation
    allowance reduces tax assets to their estimated realizable value.

Determining the liability for uncertain tax positions requires
    us to make significant estimates and judgments as to whether,
    and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due based on
    potential tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax
    jurisdictions throughout the world. Our estimates are based on
    the outcomes of previous audits, as well as the precedents set
    in cases in which others have taken similar tax positions to
    those taken by us. If we later determine that our exposure is
    lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our
    revised expectations, we adjust the liability and effect a
    related change in our tax provision during the period in which
    we make such a determination.

The accounting guidance for income taxes prescribes a
    comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure,
    present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax
    positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return
    (including a decision whether to file or not to file a return in
    a particular jurisdiction). We recognize the tax liability for
    uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on
    the two-step process prescribed in the interpretation. The first
    step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that
    each income tax position would be sustained upon audit. The
    second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the
    amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
    upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority. Estimating
    these amounts requires us to determine the probability of
    various possible outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax
    positions on a quarterly basis. See Note 14 of the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements for further
    discussion.

Net Income per Share

— Basic net income per
    share is computed by dividing income available to common
    stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding, excluding common shares subject to repurchase for
    that period. Diluted net income per share is computed giving
    effect to all dilutive potential shares that were outstanding
    during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of
    incremental common shares subject to repurchase, common shares
    issuable upon exercise of stock options, restricted stock
    awards, ESPP shares, warrants, and assumed conversion of our
    Notes.. Repurchased shares are held as treasury stock and our
    outstanding shares used to calculate earnings per share have
    been reduced by the weighted number of repurchased shares.

3.

Concentration
    of Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash
    equivalents, investments, foreign exchange contracts and
    accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and short-term investments
    consist primarily of corporate bonds, U.S. government
    agency securities, and money market funds, all of which are
    considered high investment grade. Our policy is to limit the
    amount of credit exposure through diversification and investment
    in highly rated securities. We further mitigate concentrations
    of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in
    the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk
    across geographies and type of issuer.



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Our long term investments, including auction rate securities,
    have been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to
    uncertainties in the credit and capital markets.

In entering into forward foreign exchange contracts, we have
    assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of
    counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The
    counterparties to these contracts are major multinational
    commercial banks, and we do not expect any losses as a result of
    counterparty defaults.

We sell our products primarily to large organizations in
    different industries and geographies. We do not require
    collateral or other security to support accounts receivable. In
    addition, we maintain an allowance for potential credit losses.
    To reduce credit risk, we perform ongoing credit evaluations on
    our customers’ financial condition. We establish an
    allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding
    the credit risk of customers, historical trends and other
    information and, to date, such losses have been within
    management’s expectations. Concentrations of credit risk
    with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the
    wide variety of customers who are dispersed across many
    geographic regions.

There are no concentrations of business transacted with a
    particular market that would severely impact our business in the
    near term. However, we currently rely on a limited number of
    suppliers for certain key components and a few key contract
    manufacturers to manufacture most of our products; any
    disruption or termination of these arrangements could materially
    adversely affect our operating results.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2009, the FASB issued revised guidance for the
    accounting for variable interest entities (VIEs). The scope
    within the revised standard now includes qualifying
    special-purpose entities and provides revised guidance on
    (1) determining the primary beneficiary of the VIE,
    (2) how power is shared, (3) consideration for
    kick-out, participating and protective rights,
    (4) reconsideration of the primary beneficiary,
    (5) reconsideration of a VIE, (6) fees paid to
    decision makers or service providers, and (7) presentation
    requirements. We are required to adopt this standard at the
    beginning of fiscal 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact
    of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial
    statements, but do not expect the adoption to have a material
    impact on our financial statements.

In October 2009, the FASB amended the accounting standards for
    multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to:

(i) provide updated guidance on whether multiple
    deliverables exist, how the deliverables in an arrangement
    should be separated, and how the consideration should be
    allocated;

(ii) require an entity to allocate revenue in an
    arrangement using best estimate of selling prices (BESP) of
    deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor-specific objective
    evidence of selling price (VSOE) or third-party evidence of
    selling price (TPE);

(iii) eliminate the use of the residual method and require
    an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price
    method; and

(iv) expand the disclosure requirements to require an
    entity to provide both qualitative and quantitative information
    about the significant judgments made in applying the revised
    guidance and subsequent changes in those judgments that may
    significantly affect the timing or amount of revenue recognition.

In addition, in October 2009, the FASB amended the accounting
    standards for revenue recognition to exclude tangible products
    containing software components and non-software components that
    function together to deliver the tangible product’s
    essential functionality from the scope of the software revenue
    recognition guidance. The revised revenue recognition accounting
    standards are effective for revenue arrangements entered into or
    materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
    June 15, 2010 and shall be applied on a prospective basis.
    Earlier application is permitted. We are required to adopt this
    standard at the beginning of fiscal 2012, which begins on

April 30, 2011. We are assessing the impact of the new
    accounting standards on our financial position and results of
    operations.

In January 2010, the FASB issued revised guidance on disclosures
    related to fair value measurements. This guidance requires new
    disclosures about significant transfers in and out of
    Level 1 and Level 2 and separate disclosures about
    purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements with respect to
    Level 3 measurements. The guidance also clarifies existing
    fair value disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs
    used to measure fair value. The new disclosures and
    clarifications of existing disclosures were effective for us in
    fiscal 2010, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales,
    issuances, and settlements relating to Level 3
    measurements, which will be effective for us in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2012. We do not expect the adoption to have a
    material impact on our financial statements.

Financial
    Instruments and Fair Value

We measure assets and liabilities at fair value based upon
    expected exit price, representing the amount that would be
    received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability, as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between
    market participants. As such, fair value may be based on
    assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an
    asset or liability. The accounting guidance provides a framework
    for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring
    basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned
    a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels
    of inputs to measure fair value:

Level 1:

Observable inputs that reflect
    quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities
    in active markets.

Level 2:

Inputs reflect quoted prices for
    identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;
    quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
    markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for
    the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived
    principally from or corroborated by observable market data by
    correlation or other means.

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs reflecting
    our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to
    determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be
    consistent with market participant assumptions that are
    reasonably available.

We consider an active market to be one in which transactions for
    the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and
    volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, and
    view an inactive market as one in which there are few
    transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not
    current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time
    or among market makers. Where appropriate, our own or the
    counterparty’s non-performance risk is considered in
    determining the fair values of liabilities and assets,
    respectively.

We classify investments within Level 1 if quoted prices are
    available in active markets. Level 1 investments generally
    include U.S. Treasuries, trading securities with quoted
    prices on active markets, and money market funds.

We classify items in Level 2 if the investments are valued
    using observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark
    yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative
    pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
    These investments include: corporate bonds, commercial paper,
    U.S. government agency bonds, municipal bonds, certificates
    of deposit, and foreign currency contracts. Investments are held
    by a custodian who obtains investment prices from a third party
    pricing provider that incorporates standard inputs in various
    asset price models. We corroborate the prices obtained from the
    pricing service against other independent sources and, as of
    April 30, 2010, have not found it necessary to make any
    adjustments to the prices obtained.

The unrealized losses on our

available-for-sale

investments in corporate bonds and U.S. government agency
    bonds were caused by market value declines as a result of the
    recent economic environment, as well as fluctuations in market
    interest rates. Because the decline in market value is
    attributable to changes in market conditions and not credit
    quality, and because we do not intend to sell nor likely be
    required to sell these investments prior to a recovery of par
    value, we do not consider these investments to be other-than
    temporarily impaired at April 30, 2010.

Our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are also
    classified within Level 2. We determine the fair value of
    these instruments by considering the estimated amount we would
    pay or receive to terminate these agreements at the reporting
    date. We use observable inputs, including quoted prices in
    active markets for similar assets or liabilities. Our foreign
    currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 2
    as the valuation inputs are based on quoted market prices of
    similar instruments in active markets. Gains and losses
    generated by hedge assets and liabilities, and the related
    derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):

We classify items in Level 3 if the investments are valued
    using a pricing model or based on unobservable inputs in the
    market. These investments include auction rate securities and
    cost method investments.

As of April 24, 2009, we held an investment in the Reserve
    Primary Fund (the Primary Fund), a money market fund which had
    suspended redemptions in September 2008 and was in the process
    of liquidating its portfolio of investments, with a recorded
    value of $51.6 million that had been previously written
    down from its par value of

$60.9 million. During fiscal 2010, the Primary Fund made
    multiple distributions of its assets to its investors and we
    recognized an additional loss of $0.2 million in our income
    statement, and as of April 30, 2010, we had recovered
    $51.4 million of our recorded investment. Future
    distributions, if any, will be recognized as income upon receipt.

As of April 30, 2010 and April 24, 2009, we had
    auction rate securities (ARSs) with a par value of
    $73.8 million and $75.4 million, respectively, and an
    estimated fair value of $69.0 million and
    $66.5 million, respectively, which are classified as
    long-term investments. Substantially all of our ARSs are backed
    by pools of student loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department
    of Education. As of April 30, 2010, we recorded cumulative
    temporary losses of $2.6 million within AOCI. In addition,
    we recorded

other-than-temporary

losses of $2.1 million in other income (expense), net,
    during fiscal 2009 based on an analysis of the fair value and
    marketability of these investments. We estimated the fair value
    for each individual ARS using an income (discounted cash flow)
    approach that incorporates both observable and unobservable
    inputs to discount the expected future cash flows. Based on our
    ability to access our cash and other short-term investments, our
    expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we
    do not intend to sell these investments prior to recovery of
    value. We will continue to monitor our ARS investments in light
    of the current debt market environment and evaluate our
    accounting for these investments.

As of April 30, 2010 and April 24, 2009, we held
    investments in a private equity fund of $1.4 million and
    $2.0 million, respectively. In addition, at April 24,
    2009, we held equity investments in privately held companies of
    $1.9 million. During fiscal 2010, we recorded gains of
    $3.4 million on these investments. During fiscal 2009, we
    recorded $6.3 million of impairment charges on certain of
    these investments and adjusted their carrying amount to fair
    value, as we deemed the decline in the value of those assets to
    be

other-than-temporary.

The table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning and
    ending balance of our Level 3 financial assets measured at

    Fair Value Disclosures

The fair value of certain of our financial instruments that are
    not measured at fair value, including accounts receivable,
    accounts payable, accrued compensation, and other current
    liabilities, approximates the carrying amount because of their
    short maturities. The fair value of our Notes is disclosed in
    Note 10 of the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements and was determined using quoted market prices for
    those securities.

1.75% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due 2013

On June 10, 2008, we issued $1,265.0 million aggregate
    principal amount of 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due
    2013. The Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of the
    Company. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually at a rate of
    1.75% per annum. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2013
    unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms
    prior to such date. The Notes may be converted, under the
    conditions specified below, based on an initial conversion rate
    of 31.40 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount
    of Notes (which represents an initial effective conversion price
    of the Notes of approximately $31.85 per share), subject to
    adjustment as described in the indenture governing the Notes. We
    received net proceeds of $1,238.4 million, after deducting
    issuance costs of $26.6 million.

The Notes are not redeemable by us prior to the maturity date.
    In the event of a fundamental change, holders of the Notes may
    require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes at a
    repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
    Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
    excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.

The holders of the Notes may convert their Notes until the close
    of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding
    the maturity date if any of the following conditions are met:
    (1) during the five business day period after any five
    consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which
    the trading price of the Notes for each day in the measurement
    period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported
    sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the
    Notes on each such day; (2) during any calendar quarter
    (and only during such calendar quarter) if the last reported
    sale price of our common stock for 20 or more trading days in a
    period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
    day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130%
    of the applicable conversion price in effect for the Notes on
    the last trading day of such immediately preceding calendar
    quarter; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate
    transactions set forth in the indenture for the Notes. On or
    after March 1, 2013 until the scheduled trading day
    immediately preceding the maturity date, holders of the Notes
    may convert their Notes regardless of the foregoing conditions.
    Upon conversion, a holder will receive cash in an amount equal
    to the lesser of the conversion value and the principal amount
    of the Notes, and any shares of our common stock for any
    conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the Notes,
    if any. Holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in
    connection with a fundamental change (as defined in the
    indenture for the Notes) will, under certain circumstances, be
    entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in
    the conversion rate.

As of April 30, 2010, none of the conditions allowing the
    holders of the Notes to convert had been met and we had not
    issued any shares related to the Notes. Based on the closing
    price of our common stock of $34.67 on April 30, 2010, the
    if-converted value of our Notes exceeded their principal amount
    by approximately $112 million.

We separately account for the liability and equity components of
    the Notes. The initial debt component of the Notes was valued at
    $1,017.0 million based on the contractual cash flows
    discounted at an appropriate comparable market non-convertible
    debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance of 6.31%, with the
    equity component representing the residual amount of the
    proceeds of $248.0 million which was recorded as a debt
    discount. Issuance costs were allocated pro rata based on the
    relative initial carrying amounts of the debt and equity
    components. As a result, $5.2 million of the issuance costs
    were allocated to the equity component of the Notes, and
    $21.4 million of the issuance costs remained classified as
    long-term other assets. The debt discount and the issuance costs
    allocated to the debt component are amortized as additional
    interest expense over the term of the Notes using the effective
    interest method and an effective interest rate of 6.31% for all
    periods presented.

Note
    Hedges and Warrants

Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we purchased note
    hedges and sold warrants. The separate note hedge and warrants
    transactions are structured to reduce the potential future
    economic dilution associated with the conversion of the Notes.
    Each of these components is discussed separately below:

•

Note Hedges.

Counterparties agreed to sell the
    Company up to approximately 39.7 million shares, subject to
    anti-dilution adjustments, of our common stock, which is the
    number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the Notes
    in full, at a price of $31.85 per share, subject to adjustment.
    The note hedge transactions will be settled in shares in an
    amount generally equal to the number of shares the Company would
    deliver to holders that convert their Notes. The note hedge
    transactions will expire at the earlier of (1) the last day
    on which any Notes remain outstanding and (2) the scheduled
    trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the
    Notes. The cost of the Note hedges was $254.9 million and
    has been accounted for as an equity transaction.

•

Warrants.

We also sold to the same
    counterparties warrants to acquire, subject to anti-dilution
    adjustments, 39.7 million shares of our common stock at an
    exercise price of $41.28 per share, subject to adjustment, on a
    series of days commencing on September 3, 2013. Upon
    exercise of the warrants, we have the option to deliver cash or
    shares of our common stock equal to the difference between the
    then market price and the strike price of the warrants.

As of April 30, 2010, we had not received any shares
    related to the note hedge transactions or delivered cash or
    shares related to the warrant transactions. We received proceeds
    of $163.1 million related to the sale of the warrants,
    which has been classified as equity.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives, Inc. (“Lehman OTC”)
    was the counterparty to 20% of our Note hedges. The bankruptcy
    filing by Lehman OTC on October 3, 2008 constituted an
    “event of default” under the hedge transaction. In
    April 2010, we terminated the hedge transaction with Lehman OTC
    in exchange for an unsecured bankruptcy claim, which we
    subsequently sold to a third party for $14.2 million.
    Because we have decided not to replace the hedge, we are subject
    to potential dilution on the 20% unhedged portion of our Notes
    upon conversion if on the date of conversion the per-share
    market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of
    $31.85. The terms of the Notes, the rights of the holders of the
    Notes and other counterparties to Note hedges and warrants were
    not affected by the termination of this hedge.

Fair
    Value of Notes

As of April 30, 2010, the approximate fair value of the
    principal amount of our Notes, which includes the debt and
    equity components, was approximately $1.5 billion, or 120% of
    the face value of the Notes, based upon quoted market
    information.

Credit
    Agreements

On November 2, 2007, we entered into a senior unsecured
    credit agreement (the “Unsecured Credit Agreement”)
    with certain lenders and BNP Paribas (“BNP”), as
    syndication agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank National Association
    (“JPMorgan”), as administrative agent. The Unsecured
    Credit Agreement provided for a revolving unsecured credit
    facility that is comprised of commitments from various lenders
    who agree to make revolving loans and swingline loans and issue
    letters of credit of up to an aggregate amount of
    $250.0 million with a term of five years. Effective
    December 22, 2009, we terminated this agreement. No
    borrowings were outstanding at the time of termination and no
    penalties resulted from these early terminations.

On October 5, 2007, we entered into a secured credit
    agreement (the “Secured Credit Agreement”). The
    Secured Credit Agreement provided for a revolving secured credit
    facility of up to $250.0 million with a term of five years.
    In fiscal 2009, we terminated this agreement. No borrowings were
    outstanding at the time of termination and no penalties resulted
    from these early terminations.

Equity
    Incentive Programs

Acquisition Plans

— We have assumed stock
    incentive plans in connection with our acquisitions. The options
    granted under these plans generally vest at a rate of 25% on the
    first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and then
    ratably over the following 36 months. The restricted stock
    units generally vest at a rate of 50% on the first and second
    annual anniversaries of the vesting commencement date.

The 1999 Plan

— As amended through
    August 17, 2009, the 1999 Stock Option Plan (“the 1999
    Plan”) comprises five separate equity incentive programs:
    (i) the Discretionary Option Grant Program under which
    options may be granted to eligible individuals at a fixed price
    per share; (ii) the Stock Appreciation Rights Program under
    which eligible persons may be granted stock appreciation rights
    that allow individuals to receive the appreciation in Fair
    Market Value of the shares; (iii) the Stock Issuance
    Program under which eligible individuals may be issued shares of
    Common Stock directly; (iv) the Performance Share and
    Performance Unit Program (also known as restricted stock units
    or RSUs) under which eligible persons may be granted performance
    shares and performance units which result in payment to the
    participant only if performance goals or other vesting criteria
    are achieved; and (v) the Automatic Option Grant Program
    under which nonemployee board members automatically receive
    equity grants at designated intervals over their period of board
    service.

Under the 1999 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant to
    employees, nonemployee directors, and consultants and other
    independent advisors options to purchase shares of our common
    stock during their period of service with us. The exercise price
    for an incentive stock option and a nonstatutory option cannot
    be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock
    on the grant date. Options granted under the 1999 Plan generally
    vest over a four-year period. Options granted prior to
    April 29, 2006, have a term of no more than 10 years
    after the date of grant and those granted after April 29,
    2006 have a term of no more than seven years, subject to earlier
    termination upon the occurrence of certain events. The 1999 Plan
    prohibits the repricing of any outstanding stock option or stock
    appreciation right after it has been granted or to cancel any
    outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right and
    immediately replace it with a new stock option or stock
    appreciation right with a lower exercise price unless approved
    by stockholders. RSUs granted under the 1999 Plan generally vest
    over a four-year period with 25% of the units vesting on each
    annual anniversary of the grant date. The 1999 Plan limits the
    number of shares issued under the Stock Issuance Program and the
    Performance Share and Performance Unit Program to
    8.9 million shares plus 50% of the awards cancelled and
    returned to the 1999 Plan and 50% of the number of shares added
    to the 1999 Plan after the 2009 Annual Meeting. The 1999 Plan
    limits the value of performance units a participant may receive
    during any calendar year to $2.0 million. The 1999 Plan
    expires in August 2019.

In fiscal 2010, the 1999 Plan was not amended to increase
    addition shares for issuance. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, 1999 Plan
    was amended to increase the share reserved by an additional
    6.6 million and 7.2 million shares for issuance under
    the plan, respectively. As of April 30, 2010,
    15.5 million shares were available for grant under our
    equity incentive plans.

RSUs are converted into common stock upon the release to the

Stock
    Option Exchange

In April 2009, our stockholders approved a stock option exchange
    program (the Exchange) pursuant to which eligible employees were
    able to exchange some or all of their outstanding options with
    an exercise price greater than or equal to $22.00 per share that
    were granted before June 20, 2008, whether vested or
    unvested, for new RSUs. In connection with the Exchange, we
    exchanged options to purchase 24.5 million shares of our
    common stock for total of 3.2 million RSUs. The fair value
    of the RSUs issued was measured as the total of the unrecognized
    compensation cost of the options surrendered and the incremental
    value of the RSUs issued, measured as the excess of the fair
    value of the RSUs over the fair value of the options tendered
    immediately before the exchange. The incremental cost of the
    RSUs was $5.8 million. The value of the RSUs, totaling
    $70.1 million, is being amortized over the weighted average
    vesting period of the RSUs of 3.5 years.

    by the Company when employees terminate their employment. The
    total fair value of shares vested during fiscal 2010, 2009 and
    2008 was $1.8 million, $2.0 million and
    $1.6 million, respectively. There was $0.5 million of

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

— Under the
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), employees are entitled to
    purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the fair market
    value at certain specified dates over a two-year period. In
    fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, the plan was amended to increase the
    share reserved by an additional 6.7 million,
    2.9 million and 1.6 million shares of common stock,
    respectively. Of the 30.2 million shares authorized to be

Stock
    Repurchase Program

Since the inception of our stock repurchase programs on
    May 13, 2003 through April 30, 2010, we have purchased
    a total of 104.3 million shares of our common stock at an
    average price of $28.06 per share for an aggregate purchase
    price of $2.9 billion. As of April 30, 2010, our Board
    of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to
    $4.0 billion of common stock under various stock repurchase
    programs, and $1.1 billion remains available under these
    authorizations. The stock repurchase programs may be suspended
    or discontinued at any time.



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During fiscal 2010, we did not repurchase any shares of our
    common stock under the stock repurchase program. During fiscal
    2009, we repurchased 17.0 million shares of our common
    stock at an aggregate cost of $400.0 million, or a weighted
    average price of $23.58 per share. During fiscal 2008, we
    repurchased 32.8 million shares of our common stock at an
    aggregate cost of $903.7 million, or a weighted average
    price of $27.58 per share. The repurchases were recorded as
    treasury stock and resulted in a reduction of stockholders’
    equity.

Preferred
    Stock

Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to
    5.0 million shares of preferred stock and to determine the
    price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions,
    including voting rights, of those shares without any further
    vote or action by the stockholders.

Comprehensive
    Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income and other
    comprehensive income (OCI), which is a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity and is disclosed within the
    consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income. OCI includes foreign currency translation
    adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and
    unrealized gains and losses on our

available-for-sale

securities, which includes a temporary impairment charge of
    $3.3 million, $7.0 million and $3.5 million in

Derivatives
    and Hedging Activities

We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign
    currency risk. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is
    to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated
    with changes in foreign currency. The program is not designated
    for trading or speculative purposes. Our derivatives expose us
    to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be
    unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We seek to mitigate
    such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial
    institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any
    one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is
    monitored on an ongoing basis. We also have in place a master
    netting arrangement to mitigate the credit risk of our
    counterparty and potentially to reduce our losses due to
    counterparty nonperformance. All contracts have a maturity of
    less than six months.

Our major foreign currency exchange exposures and related
    hedging programs are described below:

Balance Sheet.

We utilize monthly foreign
    currency forward and options contracts to hedge exchange rate
    fluctuations related to certain foreign monetary assets and
    liabilities. These derivative instruments do not subject us to
    material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements
    because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to
    offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being
    hedged and the net amount is included in earnings.

Forecasted Transactions.

We use currency
    forward contracts to hedge exposures related to forecasted sales
    denominated in certain foreign currencies. These contracts are
    designated as cash flow hedges and in general closely match the
    underlying forecasted transactions in duration. The contracts
    are carried on the balance sheet at



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

fair value, and the effective portion of the contracts’
    gains and losses is recorded as AOCI until the forecasted
    transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we
    reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to
    revenues. If the underlying forecasted transactions do not
    occur, or it becomes probable that they will not occur, the gain
    or loss on the related cash flow hedge is recognized immediately
    in earnings. We measure the effectiveness of hedges of
    forecasted transactions on a monthly basis by comparing the fair
    values of the designated currency forward contracts with the
    fair values of the forecasted transactions. Any ineffective
    portion of the derivative hedging gain or loss as well as
    changes in the fair value of the derivative’s time value
    (which are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness)
    is recognized in current period earnings.

Over the next twelve months, it is expected that
    $0.7 million of derivative net losses recorded in AOCI as
    of April 30, 2010 will be reclassified into earnings as an
    adjustment to revenues. The maximum length of time over which
    forecasted foreign denominated revenues are hedged is six months.

The notional value of our outstanding currency forward contracts
    that were entered into to hedge forecasted foreign denominated
    sales and our balance sheet monetary asset and liability

Fiscal
    2009 Restructuring Plans

In February 2009, we announced our decision to execute a
    worldwide restructuring program, which included a reduction in
    workforce, the closing or downsizing of certain facilities, and
    the establishment of a plan to outsource certain internal
    activities. In December 2008, we announced our decision to cease
    the development and availability of our
    SnapMirror

®

for Open Systems product, which was originally acquired through
    our acquisition of Topio in fiscal 2007. As part of this
    decision, we also announced the closure of our engineering
    facility in Haifa, Israel.



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of April 30, 2010, we had approximately
    $3.6 million of facilities-related lease payments related
    to these activities and we expect to be substantially paid by
    January 2013.

Fiscal
    2002 Restructuring Plan

As of April 30, 2010, we also have $0.5 million
    remaining in facility restructuring reserves established as part
    of a restructuring plan in fiscal 2002 related to future lease
    commitments on exited facilities, net of expected sublease
    income. We expect to substantially fulfill the remaining
    contractual obligations related to this facility restructuring
    reserve by fiscal 2011.

Of the reserve balance at April 30, 2010, $2.3 million
    was included in other accrued liabilities, and the remaining
    $1.8 million was classified as other long-term obligations.

    total accrued interest and penalties of approximately
    $0.8 million and have included this accrual in our
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits.

During fiscal 2010, we recorded $32.1 million charge to
    additional paid in capital related to the establishment of a
    $26.1 million tax reserve to provide for the uncertainty
    relating to the tax treatment of the termination of the Lehman
    Brothers bond hedge, as well a $6.0 million deferred tax
    liability for related temporary tax return differences in the
    valuation of the convertible debt as a result of the transaction.

In addition, we are effectively subject to federal tax
    examination adjustments for tax years ended on or after fiscal
    year 2000, in that we have net operating loss carryforwards from
    these years that could be subject to adjustment, if and when
    utilized.

We are currently undergoing federal and state income tax audits
    in the United States and several foreign tax jurisdictions. The
    rights to some of our intellectual property (“IP”) are
    owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are
    made between foreign and U.S. tax jurisdictions relating to
    the use of this IP in a qualified cost sharing arrangement.
    Recently, several other U.S. companies have had their
    foreign IP arrangements challenged as part of IRS examinations,
    which have resulted in material proposed assessments

and/or

pending litigation. Effective September 27, 2007, the
    IRS’s Large and Mid-Sized Business Division
    (“LMSB”) released a Coordinated Issues Paper
    (“CIP”) with respect to qualified cost sharing
    arrangements (“CSAs”). Specifically, this CIP provides
    guidance to IRS personnel concerning methods that may be applied
    to evaluate the arm’s length charge (buy-in payment) for
    internally developed (pre-existing) as well as
    acquisition-related intangible property that is made available
    to a qualified CSA. During fiscal year 2009 we received Notices
    of Proposed Adjustments from the IRS in connection with a
    federal income tax audit of our fiscal 2003 and 2004 tax year
    tax returns. We recently filed a protest with the IRS in
    response to the Notices of Proposed Adjustments. The Notices of
    Proposed Adjustments focus primarily on issues of the timing and
    the amount of income recognized and deductions taken during the
    audit years and on the level of cost allocations made to foreign
    operations during the audit years. If upon the conclusion of
    these audits the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any
    of these tax jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax
    provision we have recorded in the applicable period or
    subsequently reserved for, our overall tax provision and
    effective tax rate may be adversely impacted. It is reasonably
    possible the company will reach a final settlement with the IRS
    on the 2003 — 2004 audit within the next twelve months.

On March 22, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for
    the Ninth Circuit held in Xilinx Inc. v. Commissioner that
    pre-2004 cost sharing regulations do not require stock-based
    compensation to be included in the research and development cost
    base of companies that have entered into a CSA and, therefore,
    the stock-based compensation does not have to be allocated among
    the participants. The Court’s ruling impacts our estimate
    of tax benefits required to be recognized under accounting
    guidance. As a result of the revised ruling, we released the
    liability established in our first quarter of fiscal 2010 of
    $38.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. For
    fiscal 2010, there was no net income tax expense impact.

We do not include unrealized stock option attributes as
    components of our gross deferred tax assets and corresponding
    valuation allowance disclosures. The tax effected amounts of
    gross unrealized net operating loss and business tax credit
    carryforwards, and their corresponding valuation allowance have
    been excluded as of April 30, 2010 are $358.6 million,
    which will result in additional paid in capital if and when
    realized as a reduction in taxes otherwise paid.

As of April 30, 2010, the amount of accumulated unremitted
    earnings from our foreign subsidiaries is approximately
    $1,181.0 million.

Network Appliance Systems India Pvt. Ltd., our Indian
    subsidiary, received a tax holiday from the Indian tax
    authorities attributed to its call center and research and
    development activities effective June 6, 2003. These
    activities qualify under the Software Technology Park of India
    (“STPI”) incentive for the development and manufacture
    of computer software and information technology enabled
    services. Under this tax holiday, net taxable income derived
    from call center and research and development activities is
    exempt from Indian taxation. This tax holiday is set to expire
    on March 31, 2011. Notwithstanding qualification for this
    tax holiday, minimum alternate tax rules in India effective for
    us as of fiscal 2009 override the full tax exemption. For fiscal
    2010, we were subject to a minimum alternate tax on this income
    in India at a rate of 16.99%. The minimum alternate tax paid is
    eligible for credit against regular tax paid in future years.
    The credits may be carried forward for ten years.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In April 2010 our Dutch subsidiary received a favorable tax
    ruling from the Dutch tax authorities effective May 1, 2010
    that replaces the previous Dutch tax ruling that expired on
    April 30, 2010. This ruling results in both a lower level
    of earnings subject to tax in the Netherlands and an extension
    of the expiration date to April 30, 2015.

As of April 30, 2010, the federal, and state net operating
    loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately
    $793.5 million and $170.0 million, respectively. The
    federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in
    fiscal 2021. State net operating losses of $6.4 million
    will expire in fiscal years 2011 through 2013;
    $10.6 million will expire in fiscal year 2014 while the
    remaining $152.9 million will expire in fiscal years 2015
    through 2030.

As of April 30, 2010, we had federal and state tax credit
    carryforwards of approximately $90.1 million and
    $82.0 million, respectively, available to offset future
    income tax liabilities. Federal tax credit carryforwards of
    $49.6 million will begin to expire in fiscal years 2015
    through 2022, while the remaining $40.4 million will expire
    in fiscal years beginning 2023. State tax credits of
    $0.04 million will expire in fiscal years 2011 through
    2013, while the remaining $81.9 million is available
    indefinitely to reduce cash taxes otherwise payable. As
    discussed above, most of the net operating loss and tax credit
    carryovers, if realized, will be recognized as additional paid
    in capital in that they are employee stock option tax attributes.

Segment,
    Geographic, and Significant Customer Information

We operate in one reportable industry segment: the design,
    manufacturing, marketing, and technical support of
    high-performance networked storage solutions. Our company
    conducts business globally and is primarily managed on a
    geographic basis. Our management reviews financial information
    presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated
    information it receives from its internal management system
    about revenues by geographic region, based on the location from
    which the customer relationship is managed, for purposes of
    allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. We do
    not allocate costs of revenues, research and development, sales
    and marketing, or general and administrative expenses to our
    geographic regions in this internal management system because
    management does not review operations or operating results, or
    make planning decisions, below the consolidated entity level.

Summarized revenues by geographic region for fiscal 2010, 2009
    and 2008, based on the our internal management system and as
    utilized by our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered our

Sales to the United States accounted for 89%, 90% and 91% of

    respectively.

The majority of our assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents
    and investments and accounts receivable, as of April 30,
    2010 and April 24, 2009 were attributable to our
    U.S. operations. Our total cash and cash equivalents and
    investments held outside of the United States in various foreign
    subsidiaries was $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion as
    April 30, 2010 and April 24, 2009, respectively, and
    the remaining $2.1 billion and $1.4 billion at the
    respective year ends was held in the United States.

With the exception of property and equipment, we do not identify

    2009 and 2008, we matched 50% of the employee’s

    is longer. There is no funding requirement associated with the
    plan and none of the benefit obligation was funded as of
    April 30, 2010. The accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation of $4.8 million as of April 30, 2010 has

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Operating Leases —

We lease office space in
    several U.S. locations. Outside the United States, larger
    leased sites include sites in The Netherlands, Australia,
    Belgium, France, Germany, India, Japan, and the United Kingdom.
    We also lease equipment and vehicles.

As of April 30, 2010, we have four leasing arrangements
    (Leasing Arrangements 1, 2, 3 and 4) for facilities in
    Sunnyvale, California with BNPPLC which require us to lease
    certain of our land to BNPPLC for a period of 99 years, and
    to lease approximately 0.6 million square feet of office
    space for our headquarters in Sunnyvale costing up to
    $149.6 million. Under these leasing arrangements, we pay
    BNPPLC minimum lease payments, which vary based on LIBOR plus a
    spread or a fixed rate on the costs of the facilities on the
    respective lease commencement dates. We make payments for each
    of the leases for a term of five years. We have the option to
    renew each of the leases for two consecutive five-year periods
    upon approval by BNPPLC. Upon expiration (or upon any earlier
    termination) of the lease terms, we must elect one of the
    following options: (i) purchase the buildings from BNPPLC
    at cost; (ii) if certain conditions are met, arrange for
    the sale of the buildings by BNPPLC to a third party for an
    amount equal to at least 85% of the costs (residual guarantee),
    and be liable for any deficiency between the net proceeds
    received from the third party and such amounts; or
    (iii) pay BNPPLC supplemental payments for an amount equal
    to at least 85% of the costs (residual guarantee), in which
    event we may recoup some or all of such payments by arranging
    for a sale of each or all buildings by BNPPLC during the ensuing
    two-year period. The following table summarizes the costs, the
    residual guarantee, the applicable LIBOR plus spread or fixed
    rate at April 30, 2010, and the date we began to make

Included in real estate lease payments pursuant to four

    (BNPPLC) are (i) lease commitments of $3.6 million in
    each of the fiscal years 2011 and 2012; $2.4 million in
    fiscal 2013, which are based on the LIBOR rate at April 30,
    2010 plus a spread or a fixed rate, for terms of five years; and
    (ii) at the expiration or termination of the lease, a
    supplemental payment obligation equal to our minimum guarantee
    of $127.1 million in the event that we elect not to
    purchase or arrange for sale of the buildings.

In fiscal 2010, we determined that it was probable that the fair
    value of the properties under synthetic lease would be below the
    guaranteed residual at the end of the initial lease terms. Our
    current estimate of this shortfall is $36.9 million. We are
    accruing for this deficiency over the remaining initial terms of
    the respective leases of thirty-two months.

Purchase
    Orders and Other Commitments

In the normal course of business we make commitments to our
    third party contract manufacturers, to manage manufacturer lead
    times and meet product forecasts, and to other parties, to
    purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our
    products. We establish accruals for estimated losses on
    purchased components for which we believe it is probable that
    they will not be utilized in future operations. To the extent
    that such forecasts are not achieved, our commitments and
    associated accruals may change. We had $148.0 million in
    non-cancelable purchase commitments with our contract
    manufacturers as of April 30, 2010. In addition, were
    recorded a liability for firm non-cancelable and unconditional
    purchase commitments with contract manufacturers for quantities
    in excess of our future demand forecasts. As of April 30,
    2010 and April 24, 2009, such liability amounted to
    $3.8 million and $3.2 million, respectively, and is
    included in other current liabilities in the consolidated
    balance sheets.



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In addition to commitments with contract manufacturers and
    component suppliers, we have open purchase orders and
    contractual obligations associated with our ordinary course of
    doing business for which we have not received goods or services.
    We had $63.3 million in purchase commitments as of
    April 30, 2010.

During the ordinary course of business, we provide standby
    letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third
    parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by
    us or our subsidiaries. As of April 30, 2010, our financial
    guarantees of $5.1 million that were not recorded on our
    balance sheet consisted of standby letters of credit related to
    workers’ compensation, a customs guarantee, a corporate
    credit card program, foreign rent guarantees and surety bonds.

Financing
    Guarantees

We have both nonrecourse and recourse lease financing
    arrangements with third-party leasing companies through new and
    preexisting relationships with customers. In addition, from time
    to time we provide guarantees for a portion of other financing
    arrangements under which we could be called upon to make
    payments to our third-party funding companies in the event of
    nonpayment by end-user customers. Under the terms of the
    nonrecourse leases, we do not have any continuing obligations or
    liabilities to the third-party leasing companies. Under the
    terms of the recourse leases, which are generally three years or
    less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease
    payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of
    end-user customer default. These arrangements are generally
    collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets.
    Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenues associated
    with the end-user financing arrangement in accordance with our
    revenue recognition policies. As of April 30, 2010, the
    maximum guaranteed payment contingencies under our financing
    arrangements totaled approximately $76.7 million; and the
    related deferred revenue and cost of revenues totaled
    approximately $81.5 million and $9.7 million,
    respectively. To date, we have not experienced material losses
    under our lease financing programs or other financing
    arrangements.

Indemnification
    Agreements

We enter into standard indemnification agreements in the
    ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, we
    agree to defend and indemnify other parties, primarily our
    customers or business partners or subcontractors, for damages
    and reasonable costs incurred in any suit or claim brought
    against them alleging that our products sold to them infringe
    any U.S. patent, copyright, trade secret, or similar right.
    If a product becomes the subject of an infringement claim, we
    may, at our option: (i) replace the product with another
    noninfringing product that provides substantially similar
    performance; (ii) modify the infringing product so that it
    no longer infringes but remains functionally equivalent;
    (iii) obtain the right for the customer to continue using
    the product at our expense and for the reseller to continue
    selling the product; (iv) take back the infringing product
    and refund to customer the purchase price paid less depreciation
    amortized on a straight-line basis. We have not been required to
    make material payments pursuant to these provisions
    historically. We have not recorded any liability at
    April 30, 2010 related to



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

these guarantees since the maximum amount of potential future
    payments under such guarantees, indemnities and warranties is
    not determinable, other than as described above.

Legal
    Contingencies

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which may
    arise in the normal course of business.

On September 5, 2007, we filed a patent infringement
    lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory
    damages and a permanent injunction against Sun Microsystems. On
    October 25, 2007, Sun Microsystems filed a counter
    claim against us in the Eastern District of Texas seeking
    compensatory damages and a permanent injunction. On
    October 29, 2007, Sun filed a second lawsuit against us in
    the Northern District of California asserting additional patents
    against us. The Texas court granted a joint motion to transfer
    the Texas lawsuit to the Northern District of California on
    November 26, 2007. On March 26, 2008, Sun filed a
    third lawsuit in federal court that extends the patent
    infringement charges to storage management technology we
    acquired in January 2008.

In January 2010, Oracle acquired Sun. The three lawsuits are
    currently in the discovery and motion phase and no trial dates
    have been set, so we are unable at this time to determine the
    likely outcome of these various patent litigations. Since we are
    unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any
    potential settlement, no accrual has been recorded as of
    April 30, 2010.

Subsequent
    Event

On May 13, 2010, we completed the acquisition of Bycast
    Inc., a privately held company headquartered in Vancouver,
    British Columbia, Canada, for approximately $80 million in
    cash. This acquisition will extend our leadership position in
    unified storage by adding an object-based storage software
    offering which simplifies the task of large-scale object storage

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls are procedures designed to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under
    the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure Controls are also
    designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and
    communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the
    end of the period covered by this report (the “Evaluation
    Date”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the
    Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective such that the information relating to NetApp,
    including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be
    disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) reports (i) is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
    rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated
    to NetApp’s management, including our principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow
    timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b)

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its
    inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
    may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
    any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
    the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
    in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that,
    as of April 30, 2010, our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective based on those criteria.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of April 30, 2010 has been audited by
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is
    included herein.

(c)

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with
    management’s evaluation during our last fiscal quarter that
    have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    effect, our internal control over financial reporting.



(d)

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

NetApp, Inc.

Sunnyvale, California

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    NetApp, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, the
    “Company”) as of April 30, 2010, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of April 30, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule as of and for the year ended April 30, 2010 of the
    Company and our report dated June 18, 2010 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial
    statement schedule.
