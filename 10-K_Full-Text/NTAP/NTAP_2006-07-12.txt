Overview

Network Appliance, Inc. (“NetApp” or “Network
    Appliance”), a Delaware corporation, is a leading supplier
    of storage and data management solutions for enterprise
    customers worldwide. The company’s broad portfolio of
    innovative hardware and software products, partnerships, and
    services helps customers dramatically simplify the complexity of
    storing and managing corporate data. Many of the world’s
    largest and most demanding corporations and government agencies
    rely on Network
    Appliance

tm

solutions for their storage and data management requirements.

NetApp was founded in 1992 around the idea of simplifying data
    management. Our initial product, the world’s first network
    storage appliance, was shipped in 1993. Now one of the Fortune
    1000 and with over 4,900 employees, NetApp has thousands of
    customers in 120 countries around the globe.

NetApp strives to provide customers the lowest total cost of
    ownership (“TCO”) by offering innovative solutions
    that simplify their environments. The company blends a
    dedication to excellence with customer-focused innovation to
    address the following customer priorities:

•

Reducing cost and complexity: NetApp works to deliver the
    lowest TCO for its customers on three fronts: 1) increasing
    the efficiency of customer systems to deliver the highest
    possible value, 2) simplifying the management requirements
    to lower personnel costs, and 3) speeding recovery times to
    significantly reduce the business costs associated with
    unavailability of critical data.



•

Minimizing risk: While helping to ensure the highest levels
    of data availability, NetApp also offers solutions that minimize
    the many business risks corporations face regarding their data,
    including mistakes that corrupt or destroy data, network attack
    and data theft, infrastructure damage from natural disasters,
    and legal issues involving regulatory non-compliance.

•

Controlling change: The scalability and flexibility
    delivered by NetApp architectural simplicity uniquely allows
    customers to quickly adapt and respond to all types of change.
    From the challenges of adopting new technologies, to changes in
    business direction, to competitive response, Network Appliance
    helps customers stay in control by preserving flexibility.

Customer
    Challenges

Network Appliance enterprise data management solutions address
    several major information technology (“IT”) challenges
    that plague today’s corporations.

•

Explosive Data Growth.

Managing the continued
    growth in the volume of data is one of the great challenges
    enterprises face today. By some estimates, the amount of data
    corporations are required to keep doubles annually. Network
    Appliance specializes in storage consolidation solutions that
    allow customers to manage this explosive growth, while lowering
    their costs. Pooled resources, which can be centrally managed
    without disruption, free up valuable infrastructure and staff
    resources, improving enterprise productivity, performance, and
    profitability.

•

Doing More with Less.

Many of the costs that
    drive up the total cost of data management are associated with
    data center operations and include tasks such as data backup and
    recovery, hardware and software maintenance, performance
    management, and resource allocation. By providing solutions
    based on a common architectural platform, along with the ability
    to flexibly and dynamically reprovision storage resources in
    real time, Network Appliance delivers solutions with unmatched
    synergy and efficiency, meaning customers can do more while
    buying less.

•

Scaling the Infrastructure.

As enterprises
    grow, customers are challenged to quickly adapt their
    infrastructure to meet the corporation’s needs. With its
    compatible, scalable storage platform, Network Appliance
    delivers systems that economically accommodate growth

and

dramatically reduce the administrative overhead associated
    with provisioning and configuration changes. Today’s
    corporations must also provide timely information to offices
    around the globe.
    NetApp

®

solutions help enterprises quickly replicate and relay
    information between many locations, fully protecting and
    increasing data access throughout the organization.

•

Round-the-Clock

Access.

All companies need to avoid costly
    downtime, be it for planned maintenance, a localized disruption,
    or catastrophic disaster. In today’s information-driven
    world, every second of downtime is costly, and hours of downtime
    can be catastrophic. Working in tandem with the existing network
    infrastructure, NetApp storage appliances and data management
    software enable customers to implement fast and robust
    replication and recovery solutions within the bounds of their IT
    budget.

•

Regulatory Compliance.

Regulatory compliance
    is a growing concern for every industry on a global basis.
    NetApp offers compliance and security solutions designed to
    address such government and industry regulations, and to satisfy
    the need for data permanence, security, and confidentiality
    while at the same time reducing business risk. By utilizing open
    industry-standard solutions and

best-in-class

partners, the NetApp regulatory compliance solutions improve
    access to information in a transparent and seamless solution.

•

Security of Corporate and Personal Data.

With
    increasing amounts of personal customer data, companies assume
    great potential risk, to their customers, their business, and
    their reputation. Network Appliance data encryption appliances
    provide the highest level of security available and can be
    seamlessly added to existing data infrastructures as required.

V-Series Family

NetApp V-Series is a network-based solution that consolidates
    storage arrays from different suppliers enabling unified SAN and
    file access to data stored in heterogeneous Fibre Channel SAN
    storage arrays. Many enterprises have made significant
    investments in multiple storage architectures to support a
    variety of different application requirements. This approach
    often results in inefficient, fractionalized islands of
    underutilized storage that can be difficult to manage and costly
    to scale. With V-Series customers can consolidate storage from
    multiple vendors and achieve:

•

Simplified storage provisioning and management

•

Increased storage utilization through “thin
    provisioning”

•

Lowered storage management and operating costs

•

Comprehensive

simple-to-use

data protection solutions

•

Improved business practices and operational efficiency

•

Transformation of heterogeneous storage systems into an
    efficient storage pool

V-Series Family include V3000, V6000, gF270, and gF980
    models and supports storage arrays from IBM Corporation
    (“IBM”), Hewlett-Packard (“H-P”), and
    Hitachi Data Systems (“HDS”).

Data
    ONTAP and Key Core Systems Software

NetApp FAS and V-Series storage solutions are all based on Data
    ONTAP, a highly optimized, scalable, and flexible operating
    system that uniquely supports a mix of SAN, NAS and IP SAN
    (iSCSI) environments concurrently. Data ONTAP software
    integrates seamlessly into UNIX, Windows, and Web environments.
    The Data ONTAP operating system provides the foundation to build
    storage infrastructure and an enterprise-wide data fabric for
    mission-critical business applications, while lowering the TCO
    and complexity typically associated with the management of
    large-scale enterprise storage infrastructures.

Data ONTAP includes the patented NetApp
    WAFL

®

(Write Anywhere File Layout) file management system and the
    resiliency offered by
    RAID-DP

tm

(RAID Double Parity), a unique double-parity software RAID
    architecture. Data ONTAP supports all of the major
    industry-standard protocols’ storage, as well as our
    complete suite of data management, data replication, and data
    protection software products.

The operating system also includes integrated secure access
    capabilities and
    FilerView

®

,
    a Web-based element manager.
    Snapshot

tm

technology, included as part of the base system, enables online
    backups and provides rapid access to previous versions of data,
    without requiring complete separate copies. Snapshot technology
    also eliminates the need to recover data from a tape archive in
    the event of a disaster or user error. In addition,
    SecureShare

®

is a multiprotocol lock management facility that is integrated
    into the Data ONTAP microkernel. The cross-protocol locking
    mechanism in SecureShare ensures heterogeneous data sharing
    without compromising security, data integrity, or performance.

During fiscal year 2006, we also installed our new
    high-performance operating system, Data ONTAP GX, at several
    customer sites. Data ONTAP GX, a next generation version of our
    operating system, leverages distributed systems technology
    acquired through the purchase of Spinnaker Networks. With Data
    ONTAP GX, multiple NetApp storage systems can be managed as a
    single entity under a global namespace. This enables all members
    of an application server cluster to access data stored across
    all of the FAS systems by using a single access point,
    eliminating the traditional complexities of mapping application
    servers to storage systems. This scale-out architecture is
    capable of achieving higher levels of aggregate system
    performance, because data volumes can span multiple storage
    nodes. Additionally, Data ONTAP GX provides the ability to
    dynamically add storage resources and transparently redistribute
    data without any disruption to client systems. The result is a
    storage system that combines the advantages of management
    simplicity with scalable performance and capacity.

    and the Data Management Family.

FlexVol

FlexVol technology, included in the Data ONTAP operating system,
    enables more efficient storage architectures with flexible
    volumes that do not require repartitioning of physical storage
    space. The FlexVol technology delivers storage virtualization
    solutions that can lower overhead and capital expenses, reduce
    disruption and risk, and provide the flexibility to adapt
    quickly and easily to the dynamic needs of the enterprise.
    FlexVol technology provisions storage resources automatically
    and enables the creation of multiple flexible volumes on a large
    pool of disks. This flexibility helps organizations maximize
    storage utilization and efficiency, simplify operations, and
    make changes quickly and seamlessly without downtime.

FlexClone

NetApp FlexClone technology enables true data cloning, or the
    instant replication of data volumes and data sets without
    requiring additional storage space at the time of creation. Each
    cloned volume is a transparent, virtual copy that can be used
    for essential enterprise operations, such as testing and bug
    fixing, platform and upgrade checks, multiple simulations
    against large data sets, remote office testing and staging, and
    market-specific product variations. Only data that has changed
    uses actual disk space. FlexClone provides substantial space
    savings with minimal overhead. Customers can manage many more
    data set variations in less time and with less risk to
    production environments.

FlexShare

FlexShare, introduced in fiscal year 2006 and included in Data
    ONTAP, directs the way storage system resources are used to
    deliver an appropriate level of service for each application.
    With FlexShare, you can host multiple workloads on a single
    NetApp system and assign individual priorities to each.
    FlexShare gives storage administrators the ability to leverage
    existing infrastructure and increase processing utilization
    without sacrificing the performance allocated to
    business-critical tasks. Using FlexShare, administrators can
    confidently consolidate disparate applications, prioritize
    specific data sets, and dynamically adjust priorities if
    business needs change.

Data
    Protection Products

In recent years, enterprises have centralized terabytes of data
    into networked storage environments to achieve lower costs,
    higher utilization, and simplified management. On the other
    hand, geopolitical events such as September 11, 2001;
    natural disasters such as the Katrina Hurricane disaster;
    government regulations such as Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s (“SEC”)

Rule 17a-4;

banking regulations such as Basel II; increased privacy
    concerns such as laptop thefts with sensitive data; and industry
    guidelines such as PCI (Payment Card Industry standard put forth
    by Visa and MasterCard), have all put a spotlight on the need to
    protect and retain data for both the public and private sectors.
    Consolidation, coupled with a higher probability of disasters,
    has created a heightened sensitivity to the impact of data loss
    and its disruptive impact on the business. At the same time,
    compliance and privacy concerns are requiring enterprises to
    retain data for long periods of time, as well as secure data at
    rest. Data protection and retention have become critical IT
    priorities, requiring cost-effective storage solutions that can
    help the enterprise protect itself from catastrophic business
    disruption at an affordable cost. NetApp offers a comprehensive
    set of hardware and software solutions, including the NearStore
    SATA-based storage,

disk-to-disk

backup solutions, a family of replication and business
    continuance solutions, compliance and security solutions, and
    tools to manage this information ecosystem.

NearStore

The NetApp NearStore family of platforms represents SATA-based
    storage platforms optimized for data protection and retention
    applications. The NetApp NearStore system bridges the gap
    between primary storage and offline storage by providing much
    faster data access than offline storage at a cost much lower
    than primary storage. This makes NearStore ideal for data
    protection and retention applications such as

disk-to-disk

backup, business continuance, archival, compliant retention, and
    digital content storage.

The NearStore family consists of the R200 platform, the
    NearStore Virtual Tape Library (“VTL”) platforms, and
    the FAS platforms with SATA drives and NearStore personality
    licenses. The R200 is a



SATA-only platform based on Data ONTAP and is available in
    capacities up to 168TB. The NearStore VTL is a

disk-to-disk

backup appliance that appears like a tape library to a backup
    software application but provides the superior speed and
    reliability of disk technologies for any heterogeneous primary
    storage environment. NetApp has also expanded the capabilities
    of its entire FAS platform line for nearline uses through a
    NearStore personality license that optimizes the system for data
    protection and retention workloads.

Virtual
    Tape Library

The NetApp NearStore VTL solution is a high-performance, easily
    managed system that significantly improves backup service levels
    and cost for traditional data center tape backup
    infrastructures. NearStore VTL ranges in capacity from 4.5TB to
    168TB and is based on NetApp system software optimized for the
    rapid sequential data throughputs seen in data center backup
    environments that use traditional backup applications such as
    Symantec

®

NetBackup

tm

and Tivoli Storage Manager.

NearStore VTL delivers value to backup customers in two
    fundamental ways: 1) it provides a far more reliable and
    high-performance storage target to backup applications than that
    provided by physical tape drives and libraries, thus enabling
    more backups to be done in less time; and 2) when backup
    data is moved directly from the NearStore VTL to physical tape
    drives and libraries, the NearStore VTL streams the data at a
    rate that provides for highly efficient utilization of
    customers’ existing tape infrastructure. The net benefit to
    the customer is that backup service levels improve substantially
    and expenditure on tape infrastructure is slowed.

Key differentiators of the NearStore VTL versus other VTL
    competition are its Continuous Self Tuning and Tape Smart Sizing
    capabilities. Continuous Self Tuning enables the NearStore VTL
    to deliver maximum performance with no manual tuning at all
    capacities, something no other VTL can do. Tape Smart Sizing
    enables physical tape utilization that is far more efficient
    than is possible with other VTLs that directly create physical
    tapes.

Data
    Protection Software Products

Network Appliance offers comprehensive business continuance and
    disk backup solutions for enterprise customer environments.

SyncMirror

®

,
    MetroCluster, SnapMirror, and
    SnapRestore

®

products provide the most appropriate level of data availability
    and cost of protection matched to the recovery point objectives
    (“RPOs”) and recovery time objectives
    (“RTOs”) of customer environments. SnapMirror supports
    fully synchronous, near-synchronous, and asynchronous remote
    replication for easy setup, management, and quick recovery.
    SyncMirror, in conjunction with other NetApp technologies such
    as RAID-DP, provides the highest level of local data
    availability to allow NetApp storage systems to continue
    delivering data after as many as five simultaneous physical disk
    component failures. MetroCluster enables a highly available
    campus or metropolitan business continuance solution, minimizing
    downtime through auto-site failover. SnapRestore greatly
    minimizes recovery time in the event of a data corruption or
    loss by allowing rapid restoration of a volume from an earlier
    point in time using Snapshot technology.

SnapVault, Open Systems SnapVault (“OSSV”), and
    SnapVault for NetBackup products provide network and
    storage-optimized

disk-to-disk

backup solutions. With the ability to transmit only the changes
    from one backup to the next, and eliminate duplicates in
    storage, NetApp

disk-to-disk

products offer very cost-effective solutions to help customers
    with shrinking backup windows, rapid recovery objectives, and
    remote office backup challenges. In conjunction with other
    products such as FlexClone and
    LockVault

tm

,
    customers can significantly enhance the value of their backup
    investment by utilizing the backups for other uses such as test
    and development, compliant retention, and business intelligence.

Manufacturing

Manufacturing operations, with insourced and outsourced
    locations in Sunnyvale, San Jose, and Fremont, California;
    Livingston, Scotland; Shanghai, China; and Schiphol Airport, The
    Netherlands, include materials procurement, commodity
    management, component engineering, test engineering,
    manufacturing engineering, product assembly, product assurance,
    quality control, final test, and global logistics. We rely on a
    limited number of suppliers for materials, as well as several
    key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies
    and



finished systems. We multisource wherever possible to mitigate
    supply risk. Our strategy has been to develop close
    relationships with our suppliers, exchanging critical
    information and implementing joint quality programs. We also use
    contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies
    to improve our manufacturing redundancy.

See “Risk Factors — We rely on a limited
    number of suppliers” and “Risk
    Factors — The loss of our contract
    manufacturers.” This manufacturing strategy minimizes
    capital investment and overhead expenditures and creates
    flexibility for rapid expansion. We were awarded the ISO 9001
    certification on May 29, 1997, ISO 9001:2000 certification
    on December 3, 2003, and continue to be ISO 9001:2000
    certified. We were awarded ISO 14001:2004 certification on
    January 6, 2006.

Research
    and Development

Network Appliance finished fiscal year 2006 with its strongest
    product portfolio to date and a broad set of software solutions
    that satisfy the needs of our growing customer base. Continuing
    with our strategy of a unified storage platform based on the
    best price performance, we introduced the FAS3000 Family. The
    FAS3020 and FAS3050 deliver outstanding power to the mid-range
    server market. This product has achieved unprecedented volume
    shipments during the fiscal year. Our FAS6070, on the high end,
    began shipping in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and is
    now delivering industry leading performance and positions us
    well as we step further into the Enterprise Data Center. These
    new platforms are also being manufactured with RoHS (Restriction
    of Hazardous Substances) compliance.

Network Appliance has seen excellent growth in the SAN sector
    during the year. We were one of the first storage management
    providers to deliver a 4 gigabit per second capable Fibre
    Channel product in 2006. Our ongoing investment in delivering
    enterprise level capabilities through our Data ONTAP operating
    system and our licensed data management products is driving our
    growth and expanding our market share. New and unique
    virtualization capabilities and data management tools, such as
    our Operations Manager (also known as DFM), consistently place
    us in the forefront of our industry in solving the complex
    problems of the Enterprise Data Center.

Acquisitions from fiscal years 2004 and 2006 are now producing
    results. The NearStore VTL was introduced in the fourth quarter
    of fiscal year 2006, along with new industry leading storage
    security appliances from Decru. In addition, next generation,
    highly scalable systems based on technology acquired in the
    Spinnaker Networks acquisition have been delivered to an initial
    set of customers. We expect these products to help us continue
    our leadership in storage innovation.

See “Risk Factors — If we are unable to
    develop and introduce new products and respond to technological
    change, or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance,
    our operating results could be materially adversely
    affected.”

    accompanying this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Customer
    Base

Our diversified customer base spans a number of large segments
    and vertical markets. Examples include:

•

Animation and video post-production.

Digital
    artists create and maintain large libraries of models, textures
    and scene generation instructions that are exploited by Linux
    compute farms to create complex special effects for games,
    movies, and advertisements. Increasing desire for more dazzling,
    realistic effects places stringent performance and reliability
    demands on shared storage systems at the core of the production
    process. Our scalable storage configurations deliver the
    performance, reliability and manageability that allow video and
    movie production customers to meet ever-increasing demands for
    more imaginative effects.

•

Energy.

Customers in the energy market have
    traditionally deployed our products to support their upstream
    exploration and production, and downstream refining and
    distribution activities, where the simplicity of the appliance
    architecture and the ability to support massive amounts of data
    are critical.



Our solutions help enable energy companies to meet their
    workflow optimization objectives, improve quality, reduce cycle
    times, and lower costs.

•

Federal government.

The United States federal
    government is one of the largest IT consumers in the world, and
    Network Appliance Federal Systems, Inc. provides solutions for
    many data-intensive activities, including intelligence
    gathering, analysis, and civilian and military operations.

•

Financial services.

New data-processing
    methodologies, shorter time frames for settlement transactions,
    and new demands for better knowledge management have required
    financial services firms to improve their data storage
    infrastructures. Network Appliance solutions for enterprise
    storage enable these financial institutions to effectively
    manage large amounts of data in a high-speed distributed
    infrastructure, enabling customers to leverage their existing
    technology investments and derive maximum value from their
    time-sensitive information.

•

High technology.

Global technology
    enterprises, including semiconductor, systems, and software
    companies, are keenly focused on reducing infrastructure cost
    and improving

time-to-market.

Network Appliance solutions enable high-technology firms to
    achieve these goals by reducing TCO and providing highly
    reliable systems and fast data access, which reduces the time
    required for software builds and chip simulations.

•

Internet.

Internet-focused businesses place
    considerable and often unpredictable demands on
    transaction-intensive, database-driven environments such as

e-mail,

World Wide Web (“WWW”), and electronic commerce

(“e-commerce”).

In a marketplace where retaining customer loyalty is paramount,
    Internet-focused businesses must have high performance and
    readily available data to ensure that their customers do not
    seek alternative providers. Scalable distributed architectures
    based on Network Appliance products improve data availability,
    scalability, and performance, while reducing the TCO.

•

Life sciences and healthcare
    services.

Pharmaceutical, bioresearch, genomic
    research, and clinical-care providers are focused on developing
    vital new drugs, improving quality of patient care, and
    increasing their returns on investment. Network Appliance
    solutions enable fast access, integration, and sharing of
    massive amounts of exponentially growing scientific and medical
    imaging data; reduced

time-to-market;

and improvements in operational efficiency.

•

Major manufacturing.

Global manufacturing
    companies face intense competitive pressure to develop
    attractive new products, improve

time-to-market,

and optimize profitability. Network Appliance solutions enable
    these companies to simplify the management overhead associated
    with storing and protecting large amounts of ERP, engineering,
    and manufacturing product data, while ensuring that information
    can be easily and efficiently distributed to manufacturing and
    distribution sites around the world.

•

Telecommunications.

Service providers in the
    telecommunications industry are faced with deregulation,
    globalization, increased competition, and often a substantial
    debt burden. As a result, they must control infrastructure costs
    while maintaining or improving services to existing customers
    and at the same time identifying and developing compelling new
    revenue streams in order to grow their business. Network
    Appliance products and solutions allow these providers to
    quickly and cost-effectively build the network storage
    infrastructure and content delivery networks required by the
    global telecommunications industry.

Seasonality

Although operating results have not been materially and
    adversely affected by seasonality in the past, because of the
    significant seasonal effects experienced within the industry,
    particularly in Europe, our future operating results could be
    materially adversely affected by seasonality.

See “Risk Factors — Factors beyond our
    control could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate” and
    “Risk Factors — Risks inherent in our
    international operations could have a material adverse effect on
    our operating results” accompanying this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



Backlog

Network Appliance manufactures products based on a combination
    of specific order requirements and forecasts of our
    customers’ demand. Orders are generally placed by customers
    on an as-needed basis. Products are typically shipped within one
    to four weeks following receipt of an order. In certain
    circumstances, customers may cancel or reschedule orders without
    penalty. For these reasons, “orders” may not
    constitute a firm backlog and may not be a meaningful indicator
    of revenues.

Competition

The storage and content delivery markets are intensely
    competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology.

In the storage market, our primary and nearline storage system
    products and our associated storage software portfolio compete
    primarily with storage system products and data management
    software from EMC, HDS, H-P, IBM, and Sun Microsystems. We also
    see Dell, Inc. as an emerging competitor in the storage
    marketplace, primarily due to a business partnership that has
    been established between Dell and EMC, allowing Dell to resell
    EMC storage hardware and software products. We have also
    historically encountered less-frequent competition from
    companies including Engenio Information Technologies, Inc.
    (formerly the Storage Systems Group of LSI Logic Corp.), Dot
    Hill Systems Corporation, and Xiotech Corporation. In the
    nearline storage market, which includes the

disk-to-disk

backup and regulated data storage segments, our NearStore
    appliances compete primarily against products from EMC and Sun
    Microsystems, as a result of their acquisition of StorageTek
    Technology Corporation. Our NearStore VTL appliances also
    compete directly with traditional tape backup solutions in the
    broader data backup/recovery space.

In the content delivery market, our NetCache appliances and
    content delivery software compete against caching appliance and
    content delivery software vendors including BlueCoat Systems
    (formerly CacheFlow, Inc.) and Cisco Systems. Our NetCache
    business is also subject to indirect competition from content
    delivery service products such as those offered by Akamai
    Technologies. On June 22, 2006, we entered into an Asset
    Purchase Agreement with Blue Coat Systems, Inc. to sell certain
    assets of the NetCache business. See Note 16 to the
    Consolidated Financials Statements accompanying this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Additionally, a number of new, privately held companies are
    currently attempting to enter the storage systems and data
    management software markets, the nearline and VTL storage
    markets, and the caching and content delivery markets, some of
    which may become significant competitors in the future. We
    believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the
    storage and content delivery markets include product benefits
    such as response time, reliability, data availability,
    scalability, ease of use, price, multiprotocol capabilities, and
    customer service and support.

See “Risk Factors — An increase in
    competition could materially adversely affect our operating
    results” and “Risk Factors — If we are
    unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to
    technological change, or if our new products do not achieve
    market acceptance.”

Proprietary
    Rights

We currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark
    laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual
    provisions, and patents to protect our proprietary rights. We
    seek to protect our software, documentation, and other written
    materials under trade secret, copyright, and patent laws, which
    afford only limited protection. We have registered our Network
    Appliance name and logo, Data ONTAP, DataFabric,
    FAServer

®

,
    FilerView, NearStore, NetApp, NetCache, SecureShare,
    SnapManager, SnapMirror, SnapRestore, SnapLock, SnapVault, WAFL,
    and others as trademarks in the United States. Other
    U.S. trademarks and some of the other U.S. registered
    trademarks are registered internationally as well. We will
    continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks
    as appropriate. We generally enter into confidentiality
    agreements with our employees, resellers, and customers. We
    currently have multiple U.S. and international patent
    applications pending and multiple U.S. patents issued.



See “Risk Factors — If we are unable to
    protect our intellectual property, we may be subject to
    increased competition that could materially adversely affect our
    operating results.”

Environmental
    Disclosure

Various federal state and local provisions regulate the use and
    discharge of certain hazardous materials used in our
    manufacturing. Failure to comply with environmental regulations
    in the future could cause us to incur substantial costs or
    subject us to business interruptions. We believe we are fully
    compliant with all applicable environmental laws. See “Risk
    Factors — Our business is subject to changing
    laws and regulations, environmental legislation”
    accompanying this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Employees

As of April 30, 2006, we had 4,976 employees. Of the total,
    1,927 were in sales and marketing, 1,246 in research and
    development, 568 in finance and administration, and 1,235 in
    manufacturing and customer service operations. Our future
    performance depends in significant part on our key technical and
    senior management personnel, none of whom are bound by an
    employment agreement. We have never had a work stoppage and
    consider relations with our employees to be good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

The following risk factors and other information included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties
    described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks
    and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently
    deem less significant may also impair our business operations.
    Please see page 2 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional discussion of these forward-looking statements.
    If any of the following risks actually occur, our business,
    operating results, and financial condition could be materially
    adversely affected.

Factors
    beyond our control could cause our quarterly results to
    fluctuate, which could adversely impact our common stock
    price.

We believe that

period-to-period

comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily
    meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future
    performance. Many of the factors that could cause our quarterly
    operating results to fluctuate significantly in the future are
    beyond our control and include, but are not limited to, the
    following:

•

Changes in general economic conditions and specific economic
    conditions in the computer, storage, and networking industries

•

General decrease in global corporate spending on information
    technology leading to a decline in demand for our products

•

A shift in federal government spending patterns

•

The possible effects of terrorist activity and international
    conflicts, which could lead to business interruptions and
    difficulty in forecasting

•

The level of competition in our target product markets



•

Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers due to industry
    consolidation, which could subject us to periodic

supply-and-demand,

price rigidity and quality issues with our components

•

The size, timing, and cancellation of significant orders

•

Product configuration and mix

•

The extent to which our customers renew their service and
    maintenance contracts with us

•

Market acceptance of new products and product enhancements

•

Announcements, introductions, and transitions of new products by
    us or our competitors

•

Deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or
    product enhancements introduced by us or our competitors

•

Changes in pricing by us in response to competitive pricing
    actions

•

Our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products and
    enhancements in a timely manner

•

Supply constraints

•

Technological changes in our target product markets

•

The levels of expenditure on research and development and sales
    and marketing programs

•

Our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions

•

Excess or inadequate facilities

•

Disruptions resulting from new systems and processes as we
    continue to enhance and adapt our system infrastructure to
    accommodate future growth

•

Future accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting
    policies

•

Seasonality

In addition, sales for any future quarter may vary and
    accordingly be different from what we forecast. We manufacture
    products based on a combination of specific order requirements
    and forecasts of our customer demands. Products are typically
    shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order.
    In certain circumstances, customers may cancel or reschedule
    orders without penalty. Product sales are also difficult to
    forecast because the storage and data management market is
    rapidly evolving and our sales cycle varies substantially from
    customer to customer.

We derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from
    orders booked in the same quarter. Bookings typically follow
    intra-quarter seasonality patterns weighted towards the back-end
    of the quarter. If we do not achieve bookings in the latter part
    of a quarter consistent with our quarterly financial targets,
    our financial results will be adversely impacted.

Due to all of the foregoing factors, it is possible that in one
    or more future quarters our results may fall below our forecasts
    and the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In
    such event, the trading price of our common stock would likely
    decrease.

If we
    are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to
    technological change, if our new products do not achieve market
    acceptance, or if we fail to manage the transition between our
    new and old products, our operating results could be materially
    and adversely affected.

Our future growth depends upon the successful development and
    introduction of new hardware and software products. Due to the
    complexity of storage subsystems and storage security
    appliances, and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort
    required to produce new products, such products are subject to
    significant technical risks. However, our new products may not
    achieve market acceptance. Additional product introductions in
    future periods may also impact our sales of existing products.
    In addition, our new products must respond to technological
    changes and evolving industry standards. If we are unable, for
    technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new



products in a timely manner in response to changing market
    conditions or customer requirements, or if such products do not
    achieve market acceptance, our operating results could be
    materially and adversely affected.

As new or enhanced products are introduced, we must successfully
    manage the transition from older products in order to minimize
    disruption in customers’ ordering patterns, avoid excessive
    levels of older product inventories, and ensure that enough
    supplies of new products can be delivered to meet
    customers’ demands.

An
    increase in competition could materially and adversely affect
    our operating results.

The storage markets are intensely competitive and are
    characterized by rapidly changing technology.

In the storage market, our primary and nearline storage system
    products and our associated storage software portfolio compete
    primarily with storage system products and data management
    software from EMC, HDS, H-P, IBM, and Sun Microsystems. We also
    see Dell, Inc. as an emerging competitor in the storage
    marketplace, primarily due to a business partnership that has
    been established between Dell and EMC, allowing Dell to resell
    EMC storage hardware and software products. We have also
    historically encountered less-frequent competition from
    companies including Engenio Information Technologies, Inc.
    (formerly the Storage Systems Group of LSI Logic Corp.), Dot
    Hill Systems Corporation, and Xiotech Corporation. In the
    secondary storage market, which includes the

disk-to-disk

backup, compliance and business continuity segments, our
    solutions compete primarily against products from EMC and Sun
    Microsystems, as a result of their acquisition of StorageTek
    Technology Corporation. Our NearStore VTL appliances also
    compete directly with traditional tape backup solutions in the
    broader data backup/recovery space.

In the content delivery market, our NetCache appliances and
    content delivery software compete against caching appliance and
    content delivery software vendors including BlueCoat Systems
    (formerly CacheFlow, Inc.) and Cisco Systems. On June 22,
    2006, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Blue Coat
    Systems, Inc. to sell certain assets of the NetCache business.
    See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financials Statements
    accompanying this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Our NetCache business is also subject to indirect competition
    from content delivery service products such as those offered by
    Akamai Technologies.

Additionally, a number of new, privately held companies are
    currently attempting to enter the storage systems and data
    management software markets, the nearline and VTL storage
    markets, some of which may become significant competitors in the
    future.

We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the
    storage markets include product benefits such as response time,
    reliability, data availability, scalability, ease of use, price,
    multiprotocol capabilities, and global service and support. We
    must continue to maintain and enhance this technological
    advantage over our competitors. If those competitors with
    greater financial, marketing, service, support, technical, and
    other resources were able to offer products that matched or
    surpassed the technological capabilities of our products, these
    competitors would, by virtue of their greater resources, gain a
    competitive advantage over us that could lead to greater sales
    for these competitors at the expense of our own market share,
    which would have a material adverse affect on our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

Increased competition could also result in price reductions,
    reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, any of which
    could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Our
    competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to
    new or emerging technologies and changes in customer
    requirements or devote greater resources to the development,
    promotion, sale, and support of their products. In addition,
    current and potential competitors have established or may
    establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with
    third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors
    or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire
    significant market share. We cannot assure you that we will be
    able to compete successfully against current or future
    competitors. Competitive pressures we face could materially and
    adversely affect our operating results.



We
    rely on a limited number of suppliers, and any disruption or
    termination of these supply arrangements could delay shipment of
    our products and could materially and adversely affect our
    operating results.

We rely on a limited number of suppliers of several key
    components utilized in the assembly of our products. We purchase
    our disk drives through several suppliers. We purchase computer
    boards and microprocessors from a limited number of suppliers.
    Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several
    risks, including:

•

A potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required
    components because we do not have long-term supply commitments

•

Supplier capacity constraints

•

Component quality

Component quality is particularly significant with respect to
    our suppliers of disk drives. In order to meet product
    performance requirements, we must obtain disk drives of
    extremely high quality and capacity. In addition, there are
    periodic

supply-and-demand

issues for disk drives, microprocessors, and semiconductor
    memory components, which could result in component shortages,
    selective supply allocations, and increased prices of such
    components. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain
    our full requirements of such components in the future or that
    prices of such components will not increase. In addition,
    problems with respect to yield and quality of such components
    and timeliness of deliveries could occur. Disruption or
    termination of the supply of these components could delay
    shipments of our products and could materially and adversely
    affect our operating results. Such delays could also damage
    relationships with current, prospective customers and suppliers.

In addition, we license certain technology and software from
    third parties that is incorporated into our products. If we are
    unable to obtain or license the technology and software on a
    timely basis, we will not be able to deliver products to our
    customers in a timely manner.

The
    loss of any contract manufacturers or the failure to accurately
    forecast demand for our products or successfully manage our
    relationships with our contract manufacturers could negatively
    impact our ability to manufacture and sell our
    products.

We currently rely on several contract manufacturers to
    manufacture most of our products. Our reliance on our
    third-party contract manufacturers reduces our control over the
    manufacturing process, exposing us to risks, including reduced
    control over quality assurance, production costs, and product
    supply. If we should fail to effectively manage our
    relationships with our contract manufacturers, or if our
    contract manufacturers experience delays, disruptions, capacity
    constraints, or quality control problems in their manufacturing
    operations, our ability to ship products to our customers could
    be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could be
    harmed. Qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing
    volume production are expensive and time-consuming. If we are
    required to change contract manufacturers or assume internal
    manufacturing operations, we may lose revenue and damage our
    customer relationships. If we inaccurately forecast demand for
    our products, we may have excess or inadequate inventory or
    incur cancellation charges or penalties, which could adversely
    impact our operating results. As of April 30, 2006, we have
    no purchase commitment under these agreements.

We intend to regularly introduce new products and product
    enhancements, which will require us to rapidly achieve volume
    production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and
    suppliers. We may need to increase our material purchases,
    contract manufacturing capacity, and internal test and quality
    functions to meet anticipated demand. The inability of our
    contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of
    high-quality products, or the inability to obtain raw materials,
    could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders.



Our
    future financial performance depends on growth in the storage,
    and data management markets. If these markets do not continue to
    grow at the rates at which we forecast growth, our operating
    results will be materially and adversely impacted.

All of our products address the storage and data management
    markets. Accordingly, our future financial performance will
    depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and data
    management markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging
    standards in these markets. We cannot assure you that the
    markets for storage and data management will continue to grow or
    that emerging standards in these markets will not adversely
    affect the growth of UNIX, Windows, and the World Wide Web
    server markets upon which we depend.

For example, we provide our open access data retention solutions
    to customers within the financial services, healthcare,
    pharmaceuticals, and government market segments, industries that
    are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with
    respect to data access, reliability, and permanence (such as
    Rule 17(a)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended) in the United States and in the other countries in
    which we operate. If our products do not meet, and continue to
    comply with, these evolving governmental regulations in this
    regard, customers in these market and geographical segments will
    not purchase our products, and, therefore, we will not be able
    to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical
    segments at the rates for which we have forecast.

In addition, our business also depends on general economic and
    business conditions. A reduction in demand for storage and data
    management caused by weakening economic conditions and decreases
    in corporate spending will result in decreased revenues and
    lower revenue growth rates. The network storage market growth
    declined significantly beginning in the third quarter of fiscal
    2001 through fiscal 2003, causing both our revenues and
    operating results to decline. If the storage and data management
    markets grow more slowly than anticipated or if emerging
    standards other than those adopted by us become increasingly
    accepted by these markets, our operating results could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Our
    gross margins may vary based on the configuration of our product
    and service solutions, and such variation may make it more
    difficult to forecast our earnings.

We derive a significant portion of our sales from the resale of
    disk drives as components of our storage systems, and the resale
    market for hard disk drives is highly competitive and subject to
    intense pricing pressures. Our sales of disk drives generate
    lower gross margin percentages than those of our storage
    systems. As a result, as we sell more highly configured systems
    with greater disk drive content, overall gross margin
    percentages may be negatively affected.

Our gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a
    variety of other factors, including:

•

Demand for storage and data management products

•

Discount levels and price competition

•

Direct versus indirect and OEM sales

•

Product and add-on software mix

•

The mix of services as a percentage of revenue

•

The mix and average selling prices of products

•

The mix of disk content

•

New product introductions and enhancements



•

Excess inventory purchase commitments as a result of changes in
    demand forecasts and possible product and software defects as we
    transition our products

•

The cost of components, manufacturing labor, and quality

Changes in service gross margins may result from various factors
    such as continued investments in our customer support
    infrastructure, changes in the mix between technical support
    services and professional services, as well as the timing of
    technical support service contract initiations and renewals.

Our
    effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate, which could
    increase our income tax expense and reduce our net
    income.

Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several
    factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:

•

Earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are
    taxed at lower rates as compared to the United States statutory
    tax rate

•

Material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates as
    a result of a shift in the mix of pre-tax profits and losses by
    tax jurisdiction, our ability to use tax credits, or effective
    tax rates by tax jurisdiction different than our estimates

•

Changing tax laws, accounting standards, including
    SFAS No. 123R, regulations, and interpretations in
    multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the
    requirements of certain tax rulings

•

An increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes,
    including certain stock compensation, write-offs of acquired
    in-process research and development and impairment of goodwill

•

The tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and
    restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between
    reporting periods

•

Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
    liabilities

•

Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws

•

Tax assessments, or any related tax interest or penalties, could
    significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in
    which the settlements take place

•

A change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign
    earnings

The price of our common stock could decline to the extent that
    our financial results are materially affected by an adverse
    change in our effective tax rate. We have been notified of
    examinations in the U.S. and several foreign tax jurisdictions.
    The rights to some of our intellectual property (“IP”)
    is owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and payments
    are made between U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to
    the use of this IP. Recently, some other companies have had
    their foreign IP arrangements challenged as part of an
    examination. Our management does not believe, based upon
    information currently known to us that the final resolution of
    any of our audits will have a material adverse effect upon our
    consolidated financial position and the results of operations
    and cash flows. If the ultimate determination of our taxes owed
    in any of these tax jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of
    the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for, our
    operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be
    adversely affected.

We may
    incur problems with current or future acquisitions and equity
    investments, and these investments may not achieve our
    objectives.

As part of our strategy, we are continuously evaluating
    opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would
    complement our current products, expand the breadth of our
    markets, or enhance our technical capabilities. We may engage in
    future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders’
    investments and cause us to use cash, to incur debt, or to
    assume contingent liabilities.



Acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks, and we may not
    be able to successfully integrate acquired operations and
    products or realize anticipated synergies, economies of scale,
    or other value. Integration risks and issues may include, but
    not limited to, key personnel retention and assimilation,
    management distraction, technical development, and unexpected
    costs and liabilities, including goodwill impairment charges. In
    addition, we may be unable to recover strategic investments in
    development stage entities. Any such problems could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
    and results of operation.

From time to time, we also make equity investments for the
    promotion of business and strategic objectives. We have already
    made strategic investments in a number of storage and data
    management-related technology companies. Equity investments may
    result in the loss of investment capital. The market price and
    valuation of our equity investments in these companies may
    fluctuate due to market conditions and other circumstances over
    which we have little or no control. To the extent that the fair
    value of these securities is less than our cost over an extended
    period of time, our results of operations and financial position
    could be negatively impacted.

We
    cannot assure you that our OEM relationship with IBM will
    generate significant revenue.

In April 2005, we announced a strategic partner relationship
    with IBM. As part of the relationship, we entered into an
    original equipment manufacturing (OEM) agreement that enables
    IBM to sell IBM branded solutions based on Network Appliance
    unified and open network attached storage (NAS) and iSCSI/IP SAN
    solutions, including NearStore and the NetApp
    V-Series Systems, as well as associated software offerings.
    While this agreement is an element of our strategy to expand our
    reach into more customers and countries, we do not have an
    exclusive relationship with IBM and there is no minimum
    commitment for any given period of time, and therefore, we
    cannot assure you that this relationship will contribute any
    revenue in future years. In addition, we have no control over
    the products IBM selects to sell, their release schedule and
    timing of those products, nor do we control their pricing.
    Revenues from the IBM relationship were not significant during
    fiscal 2006 and accounted for approximately 1.0% of our total
    consolidated revenue. In the event that sales through IBM were
    to gain significant traction, we may experience distribution
    channel conflicts between our direct sales force and IBM, or
    among our channel partners. If we fail to minimize channel
    conflicts, our operating results and financial condition could
    be harmed. In addition, since this agreement is relatively new,
    we do not have a history upon which to base our analysis of its
    future success.

Currently we do not, and cannot assure you that this OEM
    relationship will generate significant revenue or that this
    strategic partnership will continue to be in effect for any
    specific period of time.

If we
    are unable to maintain our existing relationships and develop
    new relationships with major strategic partners, our revenue may
    be impacted negatively.

An element of our strategy to increase revenue is to
    strategically partner with major third-party software and
    hardware vendors that integrate our products into their products
    and also comarket our products with these vendors. We have
    significant partner relationships with database, business
    application and backup management companies including Microsoft,
    Oracle, SAP and Symantec. A number of these strategic partners
    are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments
    of the storage market. There is intense competition for
    attractive strategic partners, and even if we can establish
    strategic relationships with these partners, we cannot assure
    you that these partnerships will generate significant revenue or
    that the partnerships will continue to be in effect for any
    specific period of time.

We intend to continue to establish and maintain business
    relationships with technology companies to accelerate the
    development and marketing of our storage solutions. To the
    extent we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships and
    maintaining our existing relationships, our future revenue and
    operating results could be impacted negatively. In addition, the
    loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse effect
    on the progress of our new products under development with that
    partner.



We are
    expanding our indirect channel, we cannot assure you that we are
    able to maintain existing resellers, attract new resellers, and
    that channel conflicts will not materially adversely affect our
    channel relationships. In addition, we do not have exclusive
    relationships with our resellers and accordingly there is a risk
    that those resellers may give higher priority to products of
    other suppliers, which could materially adversely affect our
    operating results.

We market and sell our storage solutions directly through our
    worldwide sales force and indirectly through channels such as
    value-added resellers, or VARs, systems integrators,
    distributors, OEMs and strategic business partners and derive a
    significant portion of our revenue from these indirect channel
    partners. In fiscal 2006, Fujitsu Siemens and our two-tier
    distribution partners, Arrow and Avnet, accounted for 4.2% and
    10.6%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue.

However, in order for us to maintain our current revenue sources
    and grow our revenue as we have forecasted, we must effectively
    manage our relationships with these indirect channel partners.
    To do so, we must attract and retain a sufficient number of
    qualified channel partners to successfully market our products.
    However, because we also sell our products directly to customers
    through our sales force, on occasion we compete with our
    indirect channels for sales of our products to our end
    customers, competition that could result in conflicts with these
    indirect channel partners and make it harder for us to attract
    and retain these indirect channel partners. At the same time,
    our indirect channel partners may offer products that are
    competitive to ours. In addition, because our reseller partners
    generally offer products from several different companies,
    including products of our competitors, these resellers may give
    higher priority to the marketing, sales, and support of our
    competitors’ products than ours. If we fail to manage
    effectively our relationships with these indirect channel
    partners to minimize channel conflict and continue to evaluate
    and meet our indirect sales partners’ needs with respect to
    our products, we will not be able to maintain or increase our
    revenue as we have forecasted, which would have a materially
    adverse affect on our business, financial condition, and results
    of operations. Additionally, if we do not manage distribution of
    our products and services and support effectively, or if our
    resellers’ financial conditions or operations weaken, our
    revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected.

Risks
    inherent in our international operations could have a material
    adverse effect on our operating results.

We conduct business internationally. For the year ended
    April 30, 2006, 45.7% of our total revenues were from
    international customers (including U.S. exports).
    Accordingly, our future operating results could be materially
    and adversely affected by a variety of factors, some of which
    are beyond our control, including regulatory, political, or
    economic conditions in a specific country or region, trade
    protection measures and other regulatory requirements,
    government spending patterns, and acts of terrorism and
    international conflicts.

Our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and
    in foreign currencies. An increase in the value of the
    U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our
    products more expensive and, therefore, potentially less
    competitive in foreign markets. For international sales and
    expenditures denominated in foreign currencies, we are subject
    to risks associated with currency fluctuations. We utilize
    forward and option contracts to hedge our foreign currency
    exposure associated with certain assets and liabilities as well
    as anticipated foreign currency cash flows. All balance sheet
    hedges are marked to market through earnings every quarter,
    while gains and losses on cash flow hedges are recorded in other
    comprehensive income. These hedges attempt to reduce, but do not
    always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange
    movements. Factors that could have an impact on the
    effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of
    forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets. There
    can be no assurance that such hedging strategies will be
    successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not
    have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

Additional risks inherent in our international business
    activities generally include, among others, longer accounts
    receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing
    international operations. Such factors could materially and
    adversely affect our future international sales and,
    consequently, our operating results.

We receive significant tax benefits from sales to our

non-U.S. customers.

These benefits are contingent upon existing tax regulations in
    the U.S. and in the countries in which our international
    operations are located. Future changes in domestic or
    international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability
    to continue to realize these tax benefits. Our effective tax
    rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving
    interpretations of existing



law or regulations. Potentially adverse tax consequences could
    negatively impact the operating and financial results from
    international operations. International operations currently
    benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the Netherlands.

Although operating results have not been materially and
    adversely affected by seasonality in the past, because of the
    significant seasonal effects experienced within the industry,
    particularly in Europe, our future operating results could be
    materially and adversely affected by seasonality.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or
    increase international market demand for our products.

If we
    fail to manage our expanding business effectively, our operating
    results could be materially and adversely
    affected.

We experienced growth in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004. Our future
    operating results depend to a large extent on management’s
    ability to successfully manage expansion and growth, including
    but not limited to, expanding international operations,
    forecasting revenues, addressing new markets, controlling
    expenses, implementing and enhancing infrastructure, systems and
    processes, and managing our assets.

The growth in our business requires that we invest in people,
    processes and systems to best optimize our revenue growth and
    long term profitability. However, growth in our sales or
    continued expansion in the scope of our operations could strain
    our current management, financial, manufacturing and other
    systems, and may require us to implement and improve those
    systems. If we experience any problems with any improvement or
    expansion of these systems, procedures or controls, or if these
    systems, procedures or controls are not designed, implemented or
    improved in a cost-effective and timely manner, our operations
    may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any
    failure to implement, improve and expand such systems,
    procedures, and controls in a timely and efficient manner could
    harm our growth strategy and materially and adversely affect our
    financial condition and ability to achieve our business
    objectives.

In addition, an unexpected decline in the growth rate of
    revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expense
    growth or a failure to manage other aspects of growth could
    materially and adversely affect our operating results.

A
    significant percentage of our expenses are fixed, which could
    materially and adversely affect our net income.

Our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to
    future sales, and a significant percentage of our expenses are
    fixed. As a result, if sales levels are below expectations or
    previously higher levels, net income will be disproportionately
    affected in a material and adverse manner.

The
    market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly
    in the past and will likely continue to do so in the
    future.

The market price for our common stock has experienced
    substantial volatility in the past, and several factors could
    cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These
    factors include but are not limited to:

•

Fluctuations in our operating results

•

Fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by
    investors to be comparable to us

•

Economic developments in the storage and data management market
    as a whole

•

International conflicts and acts of terrorism

•

A shortfall in revenues or earnings compared to securities
    analysts’ expectations

•

Changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections

•

Announcements of new products, applications, or product
    enhancements by us or our competitors



•

Changes in our relationships with our suppliers, customers, and
    channel and strategic partners

•

General market conditions

In addition, the stock market has experienced volatility that
    has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities
    of many technology companies. Additionally, certain
    macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates, the
    market climate for the technology sector, and levels of
    corporate spending on information technology could also have an
    impact on the trading price of our stock. As a result, the
    market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in
    the future, and any broad market decline, as well as our own
    operating results, may materially and adversely affect the
    market price of our common stock.

We
    depend on the ability of our personnel, raw materials, equipment
    and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world. Our
    business could be materially and adversely affected as a result
    of a natural disaster, terrorist acts, or other catastrophic
    events.

Any political, military, world health (e.g., SARS, Avian Flu) or
    other issue which hinders this movement or restricts the import
    or export of materials could lead to significant business
    disruptions. Furthermore, any strike, economic failure, or other
    material disruption cased by fire, floods, hurricanes, power
    loss, power shortages, telecommunications failures, break-ins,
    and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to
    conduct business. If such disruptions result in cancellations of
    customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic
    activity or corporate spending on information technology, or
    directly impact our marketing, manufacturing, financial and
    logistics functions, our results of operations and financial
    condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition,
    our headquarters are located in Northern California, an area
    susceptible to earthquakes. If any significant disaster were to
    occur, our ability to operate our business could be impaired.

We
    depend on attracting and retaining qualified technical and sales
    personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain such
    personnel, our operating results could be materially and
    adversely impacted.

Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to
    identify, attract, motivate, and retain qualified technical and
    sales personnel. Because our future success is dependent on our
    ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products, we
    are particularly dependent on our ability to identify, attract,
    motivate, and retain qualified engineers with the requisite
    education, backgrounds, and industry experience. Competition for
    qualified engineers, particularly in Silicon Valley, can be
    intense. The loss of the services of a significant number of our
    engineers or salespeople could be disruptive to our development
    efforts or business relationships and could materially and
    adversely affect our operating results.

Undetected
    software, hardware errors, or failures found in new products may
    result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products,
    which could increase our costs and reduce our
    revenues.

Our products may contain undetected software, hardware errors,
    or failures when first introduced or as new versions are
    released. Despite testing by us and by current and potential
    customers, errors may not be found in new products until after
    commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of or
    delay in market acceptance, which could materially and adversely
    affect our operating results.

If we
    are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may be
    subject to increased competition that could materially and
    adversely affect our operating results.

Our success depends significantly upon our proprietary
    technology. We rely on a combination of copyright and trademark
    laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual
    provisions, and patents to protect our proprietary rights. We
    seek to protect our software, documentation, and other written
    materials under trade secret, copyright, and patent laws, which
    afford only limited protection. Some U.S. trademarks and
    some

U.S.-registered

trademarks are registered internationally as well. We will
    continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks
    as appropriate. We generally enter into confidentiality
    agreements with our employees and with our resellers, strategic
    partners, and customers. We currently have multiple U.S. and
    international patent applications pending and multiple
    U.S. patents issued. The pending applications may not be
    approved, and if patents are issued, such patents may be
    challenged. If such challenges are brought, the patents may be
    invalidated. We cannot assure



you that we will develop proprietary products or technologies
    that are patentable, that any issued patent will provide us with
    any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third
    parties, or that the patents of others will not materially and
    adversely affect our ability to do business.

Litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary
    technology. Any such litigation may be time-consuming and
    costly. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,
    unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products
    or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
    In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect
    proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the
    United States. We cannot assure you that our means of protecting
    our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors
    will not independently develop similar technology, duplicate our
    products, or design around patents issued to us or other
    intellectual property rights of ours.

We are subject to intellectual property infringement claims. We
    may, from time to time, receive claims that we are infringing
    third parties’ intellectual property rights. Third parties
    may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to
    current or future products, patents, trademarks, or other
    proprietary rights. We expect that companies in the appliance
    market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as
    the number of products and competitors in our industry segment
    grows and the functionality of products in different industry
    segments overlaps. Any such claims could be time-consuming,
    result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays,
    require us to redesign our products, or require us to enter into
    royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could materially
    and adversely affect our operating results. Such royalty or
    licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms
    acceptable to us or at all.

Our
    business is subject to increasingly complex corporate
    governance, public disclosure, accounting, and tax requirements
    and environmental legislation that have increased both our costs
    and the risk of noncompliance.

Because our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to
    certain rules and regulations of federal, state, and financial
    market exchange entities charged with the protection of
    investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are
    publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC, and NASDAQ, have
    implemented new requirements and regulations and continue
    developing additional regulations and requirements in response
    to recent corporate scandals and laws enacted by Congress, most
    notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our efforts to comply
    with these new regulations have resulted in, and are likely to
    continue resulting in, increased general and administrative
    expenses and diversion of management time and attention from
    revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.

We have recently completed our evaluation of our internal
    controls over financial reporting as required by
    Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Although our
    assessment, testing, and evaluation resulted in our conclusion
    that as of April 30, 2006, our internal controls over
    financial reporting were effective, we cannot predict the
    outcome of our testing in future periods. If our internal
    controls are ineffective in future periods, our business and
    reputation could be harmed. We may incur additional expenses and
    commitment of management’s time in connection with further
    evaluations, either of which could materially increase our
    operating expenses and accordingly reduce our net income.

The impact of option expensing under SFAS No. 123R
    will result in lower reported earnings per share, which could
    negatively impact our future stock price. This could also impact
    our ability to use or our future practice of utilizing,
    broad-based employee stock plans to attract, reward, and retain
    employees, which could also adversely impact our operations. In
    addition, the option pricing models used to estimate the fair
    value of employee stock options are based on highly subjective
    inputs and assumptions. If another party asserts that the fair
    value of our employee stock options is misstated, securities
    class action litigation could be brought against us, or the
    market price of our common stock could decline, or both could
    occur. As a result, we could incur significant losses, and our
    operating results may be below our expectations and those of
    investors and stock market analysts.

We also face increasing complexity in our product design and
    procurement operations as we adjust to new and upcoming
    requirements relating to the materials composition of many of
    our products. The European Union (“EU”) has adopted
    two directives to facilitate the recycling of electrical and
    electronic equipment sold in the EU. One of these is the
    Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in
    Electrical and Electronic Equipment



(“RoHS”) directive. The RoHS directive restricts the
    use of lead, mercury, and certain other substances in electrical
    and electronic products placed on the market in the European
    Union after July 1, 2006.

In connection with our compliance with such environmental laws
    and regulations, we could incur substantial costs (including
    excess component inventory) and be subject to disruptions to our
    operations and logistics. In addition, we will need to ensure
    that we can manufacture compliant products, and that we can be
    assured a supply of compliant components from suppliers. Similar
    laws and regulations have been or may be enacted in other
    regions, including in the United States, China, and Japan. Other
    environmental regulations may require us to reengineer our
    products to utilize components that are more environmentally
    compatible, and such reengineering and component substitution
    may result in additional costs to us. Although we do not
    anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of
    our operations and the effect of such laws, there is no
    assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a
    material adverse effect on our business.

The
    U.S. government has contributed to our revenue growth and
    become an important customer for us. However, government demand
    is unpredictable, and there is no guarantee of future revenue
    growth from the U.S. government.

The U.S. government has become an important customer for
    the storage market and for us. Government agencies are subject
    to budgetary processes and expenditure constraints that could
    lead to delays or decreased capital expenditures in IT spending
    on infrastructures. If the government or individual agencies
    within the government reduce or shift their capital spending
    pattern, our financial results may be harmed. We cannot assure
    you that revenue from the U.S. government will continue to
    grow in the future.

Item 2.

Properties

Our headquarters site for corporate general administration,
    sales and marketing, research and development, global services,
    and manufacturing operations is located in Sunnyvale,
    California. We own and occupy approximately 800,000 square
    feet of space in buildings at our Sunnyvale headquarters.

We have commitments related to a lease arrangement with BNP
    Paribas LLC (“BNP”) for approximately
    190,000 square feet of office space to be located on land
    currently owned by us in Sunnyvale, California (as further
    described below under “Contractual Cash Obligations and
    Other Commercial Commitments”). We expect to pay lease
    payments on the completed buildings from BNP on September 2007
    for a term of five years. We have the option to renew the lease
    for two consecutive five-year periods upon approval by BNP.

We lease other sales offices and research and development
    facilities throughout the United States and internationally. We
    expect that our existing facilities and those being developed in
    Sunnyvale, California; RTP, North Carolina; and worldwide are
    adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years
    and that additional space will be available as needed.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation
    arising in the ordinary course of business. We defend ourselves
    vigorously against any such claims. While the outcome of these

    expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will
    have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Unregistered
    Securities Sold in Fiscal 2006

On August 26, 2005, we acquired Decru, Inc.
    (“Decru”) which resulted in the issuance of
    8.3 million shares of our common stock with a fair
    value of $191.9 millions, 1.9 million shares of stock
    options and restricted stock with a fair value of
    $36.1 million and the payment of $54.5 million in
    cash, and $0.7 million acquisition-related transaction
    costs, for a total purchase price of $283.2 million.

We relied on an exemption from registration pursuant to
    Section 3(a)10 of the Securities Act and the related
    fairness hearing relating to our issuance of unregistered
    securities in connection with the Decru merger. On
    September 2, 2005, a

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion of our financial condition and results
    of operations should be read together with the financial
    statements and the related notes set forth under
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data.” The following discussion also contains trend
    information and other forward looking statements that involve a
    number of risks and uncertainties. The Risk Factors set forth in
    “Item 1. Business” are hereby incorporated into
    the discussion by reference.

Overview

Enterprises are generating vast quantities of data. The rapidly
    growing amount of data a company generates and the requirements
    to retain data for longer periods of time are driving an
    increasing demand for storage and data management solutions.
    There is an increase in demand for online access to historical
    information for business or regulatory requirements. The growth
    in storage capacity requirements further increases the
    complexity of data management. Managing the continued growth in
    the volume of data and the on-demand information access continue
    to challenge our enterprise customers. Companies are looking for
    solutions to help simplify data storage, IT administration and
    reduce total costs of ownership. Companies are migrating toward
    modular, unified storage systems away from large, fixed,
    expensive, frame-class arrays and inefficient direct-attached
    storage. There is a growing trend toward consolidating storage
    and serving a variety of applications from a unified storage
    pool.

In recent years, enterprises have centralized terabytes of data
    into networked storage environments to achieve lower costs,
    higher utilization, and simplified management. On the other
    hand, geopolitical events such as September 11, 2001;
    natural disasters such as the Katrina Hurricane disaster;
    government regulations such as Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s (“SEC”)

Rule 17a-4;

banking regulations such as Basel II; increased privacy
    concerns such as laptop thefts with sensitive data; and industry
    guidelines such as PCI (Payment Card Industry standard put forth
    by Visa and MasterCard), have all put a spotlight on the need to
    protect and retain data for both the public and private sector.
    Consolidation, coupled with a higher probability of disasters,
    has created a heightened sensitivity to the impact of data loss
    and its disruptive impact on the business. At the same time,
    compliance and privacy concerns are requiring enterprises to
    retain data for long periods of time, as well as secure data at
    rest. Data protection and retention have become a critical IT
    priorities, requiring cost-effective storage solutions that can
    help the enterprise protect itself from catastrophic business
    disruption at an affordable cost.

We believe that our strategic investments are targeted at some
    of the strongest growth areas of the storage market, such as
    modular storage, data protection, data retention, data security,
    iSCSI, and grid computing. However, if any storage market trends
    and emerging standards on which we are basing our assumptions do
    not materialize as anticipated, our business could be materially
    adversely affected. The fiscal 2006 revenue growth and increased
    gross margins have occurred while the market for our storage
    products and solutions has grown more competitive with downward
    pricing pressures that could negatively impact our future
    revenue growth rate and our future gross margins. At the same
    time, we anticipate and continue to experience further price
    decline per petabyte for our products which may have an adverse
    impact on our future gross margins if not offset by favorable
    software mix and higher average selling prices associated with
    new products. We expect our future gross margins to be
    negatively affected by factors such as global service investment
    cost; competition, indirect sales including OEM, high disk
    content partially offset by new product introductions and
    enhancements and product and add-on software mix.

Continued revenue growth is dependent on the introduction and
    market acceptance of our new products. In fiscal 2007, we expect
    to ship our new high-end products, launch our next-generation
    operating system with enhanced storage grid functionality and
    offer a comprehensive suite of data protection solutions. If we
    fail to timely deliver new products or successfully integrate
    acquired technology into our existing architecture, or if our
    new products do not achieve market acceptance or if there is no
    or reduced demand for these or our current products, we may
    experience a decline in revenue. Additionally, we plan to invest
    in the people, processes, and systems necessary to best optimize
    our revenue growth and long-term profitability. However, we
    cannot assure you that such investments will achieve our
    financial objectives.



Fiscal
    2006 Highlights

In fiscal 2006, we continued to enhance our enterprise
    solutions, broaden our customer portfolio, extend our
    channel/partner opportunities, build additional infrastructure
    to manage our growth and broaden our total addressable market.
    During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we acquired Decru,
    Inc. that develops and sells encryption software and appliances
    which offers data protection solutions for enterprises and
    governments, including regulatory compliance, privacy, secure
    consolidation, and outsourcing. We believe that the current and
    future potential for this technology will enable us to help our
    customers manage their risk of data theft and corruption with
    data encryption and authentication products. Some of the key
    fiscal 2006 highlights included:

Penetrated in enterprise data centers and expanded our
    breadth of

disk-to-disk

backup and security solutions.

We achieved
    revenue growth and profitability in fiscal 2006 driven primarily
    by our new FAS3000 midrange product line. For the first time,
    customers can choose to purchase Fibre Channel

and/or

lower-cost ATA drives, on the same system. Combined with our
    patented RAID-DP protection and our FlexVol and FlexClone
    technologies, the FAS3000 allows more cost-effective
    “ATA” drives to be used safely in primary storage
    applications, which offers the best price-performance value to
    our customers. We expect our data center penetration will win
    more NearStore deployments as customers choose NetApp data
    production solutions to back up their mission critical systems.
    During fiscal 2006, we introduced an array of products,
    technologies, and services that highlight the broad range of
    NetApp

disk-to-disk

backup and security solutions which simplify data backup
    procedures, improve recoverability, and lower backup
    infrastructure expenses. We believe that our new NearStore
    Virtual Tape Library solution will further expand our market
    opportunity as we can now provide

disk-to-disk

backup solutions for all open systems enterprise primary storage.

Extended our channel/partner opportunities.

We
    continued to make progress in penetrating and expanding our
    business in enterprise data centers with mission critical
    partners. Our fiscal 2006 channel mix demonstrated increased
    expansion through our partner programs, with approximately 55.5%
    of our business coming through indirect channels and the
    remaining 44.5% coming through direct sales. The majority of our
    block-based storage business and the U.S. Federal business
    came from indirect channels. Higher growth rates in our indirect
    channels demonstrated our increasing leverage, giving us broader
    market reach and increasing enterprise penetration.

Expanded our global services and support.

It
    is an element of our strategy to expand and offer a global,
    comprehensive,

end-to-end

suite of world-class service and support solutions designed to
    help our customers meet their goals of simplifying their storage
    solutions. We increased our business with our top enterprise
    customers who typically purchase more complete and longer-term
    service packages. The growth in service revenue in fiscal 2006
    was also driven by increases in professional services. We expect
    to continue to expand our global services and support and
    believe that such investments will help accelerate the adoption
    rate of our technology. We cannot assure you that service
    revenue will continue to grow at previous rates. We expect to
    invest in our services infrastructure commensurate with our
    revenue growth.

Broadened our total addressable market and extended our
    product lines into adjacent spaces.

We have
    brought a more comprehensive set of products to the market
    place, with the new high end offering next generation operating
    system with enhanced storage grid functionality, the

disk-to-disk

backup solution on the VTL space, the Decru security and
    encryption solutions and in early fiscal 2007 our entry into the

small-to-medium

businesses. We also continued to broaden our addressable market
    by increasing our focus on the V-Series product line, which uses
    virtualization to let customers take advantage of the management
    simplicity of NetApp Data ONTAP with their storage from other
    vendors.

Fiscal
    2006 Financial Performance

•

Our revenues for fiscal 2006 were $2.1 billion, a 29.3%
    increase over the same period a year ago. Our revenues for
    fiscal 2005 were $1.6 billion, a 36.6% increase compared to
    revenues of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2004. Our revenue growth
    was driven by the adoption of our new products targeted at the
    areas of fastest growth in storage, secondary storage for
    compliance applications and our broadened NetApp storage
    solutions that simplify data management.



•

Our overall gross margins were 60.8%, 61.0% and 60.2% in fiscal
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The slight decline in our
    overall gross margins for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005
    was primarily due to a shift in revenue mix with an increase in
    disk sales and IBM OEM business partially offset by improved
    service gross margins. The improvement in our overall gross
    margins for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily
    attributable to a favorable change in product and add-on
    software mix and improved services margins.

•

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased to
    $1,322.9 million, compared to $1,170.0 million as of
    April 30, 2005, due primarily to cash generated from
    operations partially offset by cash repurchases of our common
    stock of $488.9 million and net cash paid of
    $53.7 million in connection with the Alacritus and Decru
    acquisitions. Days Sales Outstanding in receivable were
    63 days, and 60 days, respectively, as of
    April 30, 2006 and 2005, reflecting increased sales and
    less linear shipments. Inventory turns were 14.7 times and 17.9
    times, respectively, as of April 30, 2006 and 2005 due to
    higher consigned inventory for IBM sales and new products at
    customer sites. Deferred revenue increased to
    $681.5 million in fiscal 2006 from $449.2 million
    reported in fiscal 2005 due to higher software subscription and
    service arrangements attributable to our continuing shift toward
    larger enterprise customers. Capital purchases of plant,
    property, and equipment for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 were
    $132.9 million, $93.6 million and $48.7 million,
    respectively, reflecting continued worldwide capital investment
    to meet our business growth.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates and Policies

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
    of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial
    Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. The preparation of such statements requires us to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the
    financial statements. Our estimates are based on historical
    experience and other assumptions that we consider to be
    appropriate in the circumstances. However, actual future results
    may vary from our estimates.

We believe that the following accounting policies are
    “critical” as defined by the Securities and Exchange
    Commission, in that they are both highly important to the
    portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require
    difficult management judgments and assumptions about matters
    that are inherently uncertain. We also have other important
    policies, including those related to derivative instruments and
    concentration of credit risk. However, these policies do not
    meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they
    do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that
    are difficult or subjective. These policies are discussed in
    Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    accompanying this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We believe the accounting policies described below are the ones
    that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments,
    and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results
    of operations:

•

Revenue recognition and allowances

•

Valuation of goodwill and intangibles

•

Accounting for income taxes

•

Inventory write-downs

•

Restructuring accruals

•

Impairment losses on investments

•

Accounting for stock-based compensation

•

Loss contingencies



Revenue
    Recognition and Allowances

We apply the provisions of Statement of Position
    (“SOP”)

No. 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,”

and related
    interpretations to our product sales because we believe our
    firmware and operating software are essential to the
    functionality of our hardware products. We recognize revenue
    when:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists.

It is our customary practice to have a
    purchase order

and/or

contract prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement from our
    end user customers, value-added resellers, or distributors.

•

Delivery has occurred.

Our product is
    physically delivered to our customers, generally with standard
    transfer terms such as FOB origin. We typically do not allow for
    restocking rights with any of our value-added resellers or
    distributors. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or
    return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria
    are achieved. If undelivered products or services exist that are
    essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an
    arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred.

•

The fee is fixed or determinable.

Arrangements
    with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms,
    conditions and practices are not considered to be fixed or
    determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized as
    the fees become due and payable. We typically do not allow for
    price-protection rights with any of our value-added resellers or
    distributors.

Collection is probable.

Probability of
    collection is assessed on a

customer-by-customer

basis. Customers are subject to a credit review process that
    evaluates the customer’s financial position and ultimately
    their ability to pay. If it is determined at the outset of an
    arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our
    review process, revenue is deferred and recognized when
    collection becomes probable.

For arrangements with multiple elements, we allocate revenue to
    each element using the residual method. When all of the
    undelivered elements are software-related, this allocation is
    based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the
    undelivered items. When the undelivered elements include
    non-software related items that are only sold as a bundle with
    software related items, this allocation is based on objective
    and reliable evidence of fair value, in accordance with Emerging
    Issues Task Force Issue

No. 00-21,

“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables”

(“EITF 00-21”).

We defer the portion of the arrangement fee equal to the fair
    value of the undelivered elements until they are delivered.
    Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the
    price charged when the element is sold separately. If vendor
    specific evidence cannot be obtained to determine fair value of
    the undelivered elements, revenue from the entire arrangement
    would be deferred and recognized as these elements are
    delivered. This would have a material effect on the timing of
    product revenues.

A typical arrangement includes product, software subscription,
    and maintenance. Some arrangements include technical consulting
    and training. Software subscriptions represent the right to
    unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a

when-and-if-available

basis, bug fixes, and patch releases. Service maintenance
    includes contracts for technical support and hardware
    maintenance. Revenue from software subscriptions and service
    maintenance is recognized ratably over the contractual term,
    generally one to three years. We typically sell technical
    consulting services and training separately from any of our
    other revenue elements, either on a time and materials basis or
    for fixed price standard projects. The type of work that is
    performed is not essential to the functionality of the software
    or hardware. Accordingly, we recognize revenue as the services
    are performed and in accordance with

EITF 03-05

“Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to
    Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing

More-Than-Incidental

Software”.

Revenue from hardware installation services
    is a non-software deliverable because the software is not
    essential to the functionality of the installation service and
    is therefore outside of the scope of

SOP 97-2.

Revenue from shipping and handling is included in product
    revenue and its related cost included in cost of product revenue.

We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at
    the time of shipment. Sales returns are estimated based on
    historical sales returns, changes in customer demand, current
    trends, and our expectations regarding future experience.
    Reductions to revenue associated with sales returns include
    consideration of historical sales levels, the timing and
    magnitude of historical sales returns and a projection of this
    experience into the future. We monitor and analyze the accuracy
    of sales returns estimate by reviewing actual returns and adjust
    it for future expectations to



determine the adequacy of our current and future reserve needs.
    If actual future returns and allowances differ from past
    experience and expectation, additional allowances may be
    required.

We also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for
    estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility
    of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts
    receivable. We analyze accounts receivable and historical bad
    debts, customer concentrations, customer solvency, current
    economic and geographic trends, and changes in customer payment
    terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of the
    allowance for doubtful accounts. In circumstances where we are
    aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its
    financial obligations to us, a specific allowance for bad debt
    is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized
    receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be
    collected. We monitor and analyze the accuracy of allowance for
    doubtful accounts estimate by reviewing past collectibility and
    adjust it for future expectations to determine the adequacy of
    our current and future allowance. Our allowance for doubtful
    accounts as of April 30, 2006 was $2.4 million,
    compared to $5.4 million as of April 30, 2005. If the
    financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate,
    resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments,
    additional allowances may be required.

Valuation
    of Goodwill and Intangibles

Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over time, while
    in-process research and development is recorded as a charge on
    the date of acquisition and goodwill is capitalized, subject to
    periodic review for impairment. Accordingly, the allocation of
    the acquisition cost to identifiable intangible assets has a
    significant impact on our future operating results. The
    allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and
    assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows expected
    to be generated by the acquired assets. Should conditions be
    different than management’s current assessment, material
    write-downs of the fair value of intangible assets may be
    required. We periodically review the estimated remaining useful
    lives of our other intangible assets. A reduction in the
    estimate of remaining useful life could result in accelerated
    amortization expense or a write-down in future periods. As such,
    any future write-downs of these assets would adversely affect
    our gross and operating margins.

Under our accounting policy we perform an annual review in the
    fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators
    of impairment exist. Triggering events for impairment reviews
    may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends,
    restructuring actions, lower projections of profitability, or a
    sustained decline in our market capitalization. Evaluations of
    possible impairment and, if applicable, adjustments to carrying
    values, require us to estimate, among other factors, future cash
    flows, useful lives, and fair market values of our reporting
    units and assets. When we conduct our evaluation of goodwill,
    the fair value of goodwill is assessed using valuation
    techniques that require significant management judgment. Should
    conditions be different from management’s last assessment,
    significant write-downs of goodwill may be required. In fiscal
    2006 and 2005, we performed such evaluation and found no
    impairment. However, any future write-downs of goodwill would
    adversely affect our operating margins. As of April 30,
    2006, our assets included $487.5 million in goodwill. See
    Note 14, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible
    Assets” to our consolidated financial statements.

During fiscal 2006, we adjusted goodwill by $3.5 million
    and $2.1 million relating to the tax benefits associated
    with the subsequent exercise of previously vested assumed
    Spinnaker and Decru options, respectively. Estimated future
    adjustments to goodwill related to the tax benefits associated
    with subsequent exercise of previously vested assumed options by
    previous acquisitions are approximately $8.4 million,
    subject to future cancellations relating to employee
    terminations.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

The determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments
    and estimates due to operations in several tax jurisdictions
    outside the U.S. Earnings derived from our international
    business are generally taxed at rates that are lower than
    U.S. rates, resulting in a reduction of our effective tax
    rate. The ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is
    contingent upon existing tax laws in both the U.S. and the
    respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are
    located. Future changes in domestic or international tax laws
    could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we
    are currently receiving and expect to receive from international
    business. In addition, a



decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from our
    international business or in the mix of international business
    among particular tax jurisdictions could increase our overall
    effective tax rate.

While most of our profits are earned in foreign jurisdictions
    with income tax rates generally lower than the combined
    U.S. federal and state income tax rates, judgment must be
    made with respect to other estimates of income tax provision,
    such as R&D tax credits and valuation allowances against
    deferred tax assets, primarily those set up for net operating
    losses and income tax credits.

The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets, which
    consists primarily of the reversal of net deductible temporary
    differences including credits and net operating loss
    carryforwards, assumes that we will be able to generate
    sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize these tax
    attributes. If we do not generate sufficient future income, the
    realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired,
    resulting in additional income tax expense. We have provided a
    valuation allowance of $431.2 million as of April 30,
    2006 on the deferred tax attributes associated with the exercise
    of employee stock options (primarily credits and net operating
    loss carryforwards) because of uncertainty regarding their
    realization due to the expectation that future employee stock
    option exercises will reduce our ability to generate sufficient
    taxable income in the future. In the event these attributes are
    realized, the associated tax benefit will be credited to
    stockholders’ equity, rather than as a reduction in the
    income tax provision.

Prior to fiscal year 2006, our current effective tax rate
    assumed that U.S. income taxes were not provided for
    undistributed earnings of certain

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

However, pursuant to the one-time incentive created under
    Section 965 of The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the
    “Jobs Act”), our foreign subsidiaries remitted
    approximately $405.5 million in accumulated earned income
    on which we incurred approximately $22.5 million in federal
    and state income taxes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year
    2006. In fiscal 2004, we recorded an income tax benefit of
    $16.8 million associated with a favorable foreign tax
    ruling. This favorable ruling from the Netherlands provided for
    retroactive benefits dating back to fiscal year 2001 and
    continuing until December 31, 2005. Subsequent to our
    fiscal 2005 year end, we obtained a new tax ruling from the
    Netherlands, which terminated the first ruling and provides for
    continuing favorable tax rate benefits until April 30,
    2010. As of April 30, 2006, our Netherlands subsidiary had
    a conditional royalty expense carryforward of $51.7 million
    that may become available for offset against future Dutch
    income. The carryforward may not, however, be used to offset
    income under the new Dutch tax ruling expiring April 30,
    2010. We have established a valuation allowance against the
    deferred tax asset for this carryforward based upon our belief
    that we will not be able to utilize this attribute.

We have been notified of examinations in the U.S. and several
    foreign tax jurisdictions. Our management does not believe,
    based upon information currently known to it that the final
    resolution of any of these audits will have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations. However, if upon the
    conclusion of these audits the ultimate determination of our
    taxes owed in any of these tax jurisdictions is for an amount in
    excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for,
    our overall effective tax rate may be adversely impacted.

Beginning with the fiscal year 2007 implementation of
    SFAS No. 123R, we may experience adverse impacts to
    future years effective tax rates in the event that we determine
    that our APIC pool as of the beginning of fiscal year 2007 is
    not sufficient enough to cover the impacts of future stock
    compensation shortfalls.

Inventory
    Write-Downs

Our inventories net balance was $64.5 million as of
    April 30, 2006, compared with $39.0 million as of
    April 30, 2005. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out basis) or market. We perform an in depth excess and
    obsolete analysis of our inventory based upon assumptions about
    future demand and market conditions. We adjust the inventory
    value based on estimated excess and obsolete inventories
    determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Although we
    strive for accuracy in our forecasts of future product demand,
    any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological
    developments could have a significant impact on the value of our
    inventory and commitments, and our reported results. If actual
    market conditions are less favorable than those projected,
    additional write-downs and other charges against earnings may be
    required. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may
    realize higher gross margins in the period when the written-down
    inventory is sold.



We record purchase commitment liabilities with our contract
    manufacturers and suppliers as a result of changes in demand
    forecasts or as we transition our products. As of April 30,
    2006, we do not have purchase commitment under such arrangements.

We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes,
    including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our
    component suppliers. We also provide for the estimated cost of
    known product failures based on known quality issues when they
    arise. Should actual cost of product failure differ from our
    estimates, revisions to the estimated liability would be
    required.

We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign
    environmental regulations relating to the use, storage,
    discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our
    manufacturing process or requiring design changes or recycling
    of products we manufacture. We will continue to monitor our
    environmental compliance and could incur higher costs including
    additional reserves for excess component inventory.

Restructuring
    Accruals

In fiscal 2002, as a result of continuing unfavorable economic
    conditions and a reduction in IT spending rates, we implemented
    two restructuring plans, which included reductions in our
    workforce and a consolidation of our facilities. In fiscal 2006,
    we implemented the third restructuring plan related to the move
    of our global service center operations. In determining
    restructuring charges, we analyze our future business
    requirements in order to properly align and manage our business
    commensurate with our future revenue levels.

Our restructuring costs, and any resulting accruals, involve
    significant estimates made by management using the best
    information available at the time the estimates are made, some
    of which may be provided by third parties. In recording
    severance reserves, we accrue a liability when the following
    conditions have been met: employees’ rights to receive
    compensation is attributable to employees’ services already
    rendered; the obligation relates to rights that vest or
    accumulate; payment of the compensation is probable; and the
    amount can be reasonably estimated. In recording facilities
    lease restructuring reserve, we make various assumptions,
    including the time period over which the facilities are expected
    to be vacant, expected sublease terms, expected sublease rates,
    anticipated future operating expenses, and expected future use
    of the facilities.

Our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some
    of which are beyond our control, including future real estate
    market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into
    subleases or lease termination agreements with terms as
    favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates. We
    regularly evaluate a number of factors to determine the
    appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring and
    lease loss accruals including the various assumptions noted
    above. If actual results differ significantly from our
    estimates, we may be required to adjust our restructuring and
    lease loss accruals in the future. In fiscal 2005, we estimated
    our facility restructuring reserve to be $4.5 million. Our
    fiscal 2006 estimate for the facility restructuring reserve was
    $2.7 million which included a $1.0 million adjustment
    due to the execution of new sublease agreement for our Tewksbury
    facility net of related cost.

Impairment
    Losses on Investments

As of April 30, 2006, our short-term investments have been
    classified as

“available-for-sale”

and are carried at fair value. There have been no significant
    declines in fair value of investments that are considered to be

other-than-temporary,

for any of the three years in the period ended April 30,
    2006. The fair value of our

available-for-sale

investment reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was
    $1,102.8 million and $976.4 million as of
    April 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We have not
    identified any of these declines to be other than temporary as
    market declines of our investments have been caused by interest
    rate changes and were not due to credit worthiness. Because we
    have the ability to hold these investments until maturity, we
    would not expect any significant decline in value of our
    investments caused by market interest rate changes. We have no
    impairment losses on our

available-for-sale

investment or investment in privately held companies for fiscal
    2006, 2005 and 2004.

All of our

available-for-sale

investments and non-marketable equity securities are subject to
    a periodic impairment review. Investments are considered to be
    impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be



other-than-temporary.

This determination requires significant judgment. For publicly
    traded investments, impairment is determined based upon the
    specific facts and circumstances present at the time, including
    factors such as current economic and market conditions, the
    credit rating of the security’s issuer, the length of time
    an investment’s fair value has been below our carrying
    value, and our ability to hold investments to maturity. If an
    investment’s decline in fair value, caused by factors other
    than changes in interest rates, is deemed to be

other-than-temporary,

we would reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value,
    as determined based on quoted market prices or liquidation
    values. Our investments in privately held companies were
    $11.0 million and $1.8 million as of April 30,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. For non-marketable equity
    securities, the impairment analysis requires the identification
    of events or circumstances that would likely have a significant
    adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, including,
    revenue and earnings trends, overall business prospects, limited
    capital resources, limited prospects of receiving additional
    financing, limited prospects for liquidity of the related
    securities and general market conditions in the investees’
    industry.

Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation

We adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
    SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148 and
    provide pro forma disclosure using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model to value our employee stock options. The fair
    value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
    using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and is not
    remeasured as a result of subsequent stock price fluctuations.
    Option pricing models require the input of highly subjective
    assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility,
    expected life and forfeiture rate. We are currently evaluating
    the expected volatility rates in accordance with
    SAB No. 107, including the use of historical, blended
    and implied volatility. As of May 1, 2006, the contractual
    life of our stock options has been shortened to seven years from
    ten years for options issued on or after this date, and to the
    extent that the shorter life changes employees’ exercise
    behavior, it may change the expected term of an option going
    forward. SFAS No. 123R will require us to include
    estimated forfeitures, and therefore, the required adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R could have a material impact on the
    timing of and, based on the accuracy of estimates of future
    actual forfeiters, the amount stock compensation expense. Any
    changes in these highly objective assumptions may significantly
    impact the stock compensation expenses for the future.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

“Share-Based Payment”

(“SFAS No. 123R”), see discussion under
    New Accounting Standards below. In March 2005, the SEC issued
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107
    (“SAB 107”). SAB 107 includes interpretive
    guidance for the initial implementation of
    SFAS No. 123R. We will apply the principles of
    SAB 107 in conjunction with our adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R in our first quarter of fiscal 2007,
    which begins on May 1, 2006.

Loss
    Contingencies

We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies
    arising in the course of business. We consider the likelihood of
    the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a
    liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the
    amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated
    loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability
    has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount
    of loss can be reasonably estimated. In fiscal 2006, 2005 and
    2004, we did not identify or accrue for any loss contingencies.
    We regularly evaluate current information available to us to
    determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.

New
    Accounting Standards

In November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position

FSP 115-1

which addresses the determination as to when an investment is
    considered impaired, whether that impairment is

other-than-temporary,

and the measurement of an impairment loss. This FSP also
    includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition
    of an

other-than-temporary

impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized
    losses that have not been recognized as

other-than-temporary

impairments. The guidance in this FSP amends Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115,
    “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
    Securities” and APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity
    Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” The
    guidance in FSP 115-1 shall be applied to reporting periods
    beginning after December 15, 2005. We are required to adopt
    FSP 115-1 for fiscal years beginning after May 1, 2006. We
    are



currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of FSP 115-1
    will have on our consolidated results of operations and
    financial condition but do not expect it to have a material
    impact.

In June 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154
    (“SFAS No. 154”),

Accounting Changes and
    Error Corrections: a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board
    Opinion No. 20 (“APB 20”) and FASB Statement
    No 3.

SFAS No. 154 requires
    retrospective application for voluntary changes in accounting
    principle unless it is impracticable to do so. Retrospective
    application refers to the application of a different accounting
    principle to previously issued financial statements as if that
    principle had always been used. SFAS No. 154’s
    retrospective-application requirement replaces
    APB 20’s requirement to recognize most voluntary
    changes in accounting principle by including in net income of
    the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to
    the new accounting principle. This Statement defines
    retrospective application as the application of a different
    accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that
    principle had always been used or as the adjustment of
    previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in
    the reporting entity. This Statement also redefines restatement
    as the revising of previously issued financial statements to
    reflect the correction of an error. The requirements are
    effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2005 and will only impact the
    consolidated financial statements in periods in which a change
    in accounting principle is made.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151
    “

Inventory Costs”

(SFAS No. 151).
    This statement amends the guidance in ARB No. 43,
    Chapter 4, “Inventory Pricing,” to clarify the
    accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
    freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage).
    SFAS No. 151 requires that those items be recognized
    as current-period charges. In addition, this Statement requires
    that allocation of fixed production overhead to costs of
    conversion be based upon the normal capacity of the production
    facilities. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 are
    effective for inventory cost incurred in fiscal years beginning
    after June 15, 2005. As such, we are required to adopt
    these provisions at the beginning of fiscal 2007, which begins
    on May 1, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 151 to have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R.
    Generally, the requirements of SFAS No. 123R are
    similar to those of SFAS No. 123. However,
    SFAS No. 123R requires companies to now recognize all
    share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
    stock options, in their statements of operations based on the
    fair value of the payments. Pro forma disclosure will no longer
    be an alternative. The effective date of the new standard for
    our consolidated financial statements is the first quarter of
    fiscal 2007, which begins on May 1, 2006.

In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
    (“SAB”) No. 107, which provides guidance on the
    implementation of SFAS No. 123R,

“Share-Based
    Payments”

(SFAS No. 123R) (see discussion
    below). In particular, SAB No. 107 provides key
    guidance related to valuation methods (including assumptions
    such as expected volatility and expected term), the accounting
    for income tax effects of share-based payment arrangements upon
    adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the modification of
    employee share options prior to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R, the classification of compensation
    expense, capitalization of compensation cost related to
    share-based payment arrangements, first-time adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R in an interim period, and disclosures in
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis subsequent to the
    adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 123R-3,

Transition Election and Accounting for Tax
    Effects.

The guidance provides a simplified
    method to calculate the Additional Paid-In Capital (APIC) pool
    for beginning balance of excess tax benefits and the method of
    determining the subsequent impact on the pool of option awards
    that are outstanding and fully or partially vested upon the
    adoption of SFAS No. 123R beginning on May 1,
    2006. In addition, this FSP addresses that when the alternative
    APIC pool calculation is used, tax benefits related to certain
    employee awards should be included as a cash flow from financing
    activities and a cash outflow from operating activities within
    the statements of cash flows. The FSP allows companies up to one
    year from the later of the adoption date of
    SFAS No. 123R or November 10, 2005 to evaluate
    the available transition alternatives and make a one-time
    election. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the
    new method provided by this guidance.

SFAS No. 123R and its related guidance permits public
    companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods:
    modified prospective method or modified retrospective method. We
    plan to adopt SFAS No. 123R using the modified
    prospective method, in which compensation cost is recognized
    beginning with the effective date (a) based on the
    requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all share-based
    payments granted after the effective date and



(b) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for
    all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of
    SFAS No. 123R that remain unvested on the effective
    date. We will recognize in our results of operations the
    compensation cost for stock-based awards issued after
    April 30, 2006 on a straight-line basis over the requisite
    service period for the entire award. For stock-based awards
    issued prior to May 1, 2006, we amortized the related
    compensation costs using the graded-vesting method.

As permitted by SFAS No. 123, we currently account for
    share-based payments to employees using the APB 25
    intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no
    compensation cost for employee stock options as grant date value
    equals fair value. The adoption of the SFAS No. 123R
    fair value method will have a significant impact on our reported
    results of operations because the stock-based compensation
    expense will be charged directly against our reported earnings.
    The pre-tax balance of unearned stock-based compensation to be
    expensed in the period fiscal 2007 through 2010 related to
    share-based awards unvested as of April 30, 2006, as
    previously calculated under the disclosure-only requirements of
    SFAS No. 123, is approximately $240.5 million. If
    there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying
    unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase,
    or cancel any remaining unearned stock-based compensation
    expense. To the extent that we grant additional equity
    securities to employees or assume unvested securities in
    connection with any acquisitions, our stock-based compensation
    expense will be increased by the additional unearned
    compensation resulting from those additional grants or
    acquisitions. We anticipate that we will grant additional
    employee stock options and restricted stock units in fiscal
    2007. The fair value of these grants cannot be predicted with
    certainty at this time due to the fact that the expense amount
    will depend on the timing of new grants, the number of new
    grants, changes in the market price or the volatility of our
    common stock. However, we currently estimate that the impact on
    our first fiscal quarter will be between
    $0.07 — $0.09 per share. As of May 1,
    2006, the contractual life of our stock options has been
    shortened to seven years from ten years for options issued on or
    after this date, and to the extent that the shorter life changes
    employees’ exercise behavior, it may change the expected
    term of an option going forward. We are not aware of any other
    changes in business practices and do not expect any violations
    of debt covenants due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

Fiscal
    2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005

Product Revenues

— Product revenues
    increased by 25.1% to $1,577.4 million in fiscal 2006, from
    $1,260.6 million in fiscal 2005. Product revenues growth
    was across all geographies. This net increase year over year was
    specifically attributable to increased software licenses, an
    increase in units shipped, and an increase in demand for data
    protection and mission-critical storage environments, partially
    offset by a decline in shipments and lower average selling
    prices of older generation products, lower

cost-per-megabyte

disks. Our systems are highly configurable because of customer
    requirements in the open systems storage markets we serve. As a
    result, the wide variation in customized configuration can
    significantly impact revenue, cost of revenues, and gross margin
    performance. Price changes, volumes and product model mix can
    have an effect on changes in product revenues, the impact on
    these forces is significantly affected by the configuration of
    systems shipped.

Product revenues were favorably affected by the following
    factors:

•

Increased revenues from our current product portfolio, such as
    FAS980, and FAS270 storage systems; and introduction of new
    products, such as FAS3020, FAS3050, and FAS6070 storage systems;
    V3020, and V3050 storage virtualization systems; NetCache C2300,
    and C3300 appliances and add-on software

•

Revenue generated from

disk-to-disk

backup/archival, and security solutions increased by 28.1% in
    fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005

•

Increased sales through indirect channels in absolute dollars,
    including sales through our resellers, distributors, and OEM
    partners, representing 55.5% and 51.2% of total revenues for
    fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively

Product revenues were negatively affected by the following
    factors:

•

Lower-cost-per-megabyte disks which are a significant component
    of our hardware costs. As performance has improved on these
    devices, the related sales price we can charge per megabyte of
    storage has decreased as well.

•

Declining average selling prices and unit sales of our older
    products.



The Decru acquisition and the IBM OEM relationship did not have
    a significant impact on the revenue for fiscal 2006. There can
    be no assurance that IBM and Decru will contribute meaningful
    revenue in future quarters. We also cannot assure you that we
    will be able to maintain or increase market demand for our
    products.

Software Subscriptions Revenues

— Software
    subscriptions revenues increased by 40.9% to $239.1 million
    in fiscal 2006, from $169.7 million in fiscal 2005 due
    primarily to a larger installed base renewals, upgrades and an
    increasing number of new enterprise customers. Software
    subscriptions revenues represent 11.6% and 10.6% of total
    revenues for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Service Revenues

— Service revenues, which
    include hardware support, professional services, and educational
    services, increased by 48.9% to $249.9 million in fiscal
    2006, from $167.8 million in fiscal 2005.

The increase in absolute dollars was due to the following
    factors:

•

Professional service revenue increased by 49.0% to
    $89.4 million in fiscal 2006 from $60.0 million in
    fiscal 2005

•

An increasing number of enterprise customers, which typically
    purchase more complete and generally longer-term service
    packages than our non-enterprise customers

•

A growing installed base resulting in new customer support
    contracts in addition to support contract renewals by existing
    customers

While it is an element of our strategy to expand and offer a
    more comprehensive, global enterprise support and service
    solution, we cannot assure you that service revenue will grow at
    the current rate in fiscal 2007.

A large portion of our service revenues is deferred and, in most
    cases, recognized ratably over the service obligation periods,
    which are typically one to three years, and are classified as
    short-term and long-term deferred revenue on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Service revenues represented 12.1% and 10.5% of
    total revenues for fiscal year 2006 and 2005, respectively.

International total
    revenues

— International total revenues
    (including U.S. exports) increased by 23.2% in fiscal year
    2006 compared with fiscal 2005. International total revenues
    were $943.8 million, or 45.7% of total revenues for fiscal
    year 2006 compared with $765.8 million or 47.9% of total
    revenues for fiscal 2005. The increase in international sales
    was primarily a result of revenue growth from our European and
    Asia Pacific geographies, driven by increased demand for our
    solutions portfolio, new customers, and higher storage spending
    in certain geographic regions as compared to the same period in
    the prior fiscal year. We cannot assure you that we will be able
    to maintain or increase international revenues in fiscal 2007.

Product Gross Margins

— Product gross
    margins decreased to 60.5% for fiscal 2006, from 61.4% for
    fiscal 2005.

Product gross margins were negatively affected by the following
    factors:

•

Sales price reductions due to competitive pricing pressure and
    selective pricing discounts

•

Increased sales through certain indirect channels, which may
    have lower gross margins than our direct sales in certain
    geographic regions

•

Sales of relatively lower margin add-on storage shelves and
    hardware increased by 57.1% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal

Product gross margins were favorably affected by the following
    factors:

•

Favorable product and add-on software mix with software licenses
    increasing by 32.8% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005

•

Better disk utilization rates associated with sales of
    higher-margins management software products like FlexClone and
    FlexVol that run on the Data ONTAP 7G operating system allowing
    customers to buy less disk storage but buy more high-value
    software

•

Higher average selling prices for our newer products



We expect higher disk content associated with high-end storage
    systems will negatively affect our gross margins in the future,
    if not offset by software revenue and new products.

Amortization of existing technology from acquisitions included
    in cost of product revenues was $11.8 million and
    $3.4 million for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Estimated future amortization of existing technology to cost of
    product revenues relating to acquisitions will be
    $15.5 million for each of fiscal years 2007 and 2008;
    $14.7 million for fiscal year 2009; $10.3 million for
    fiscal year 2010, $2.8 million for fiscal year 2011; and
    none thereafter.

Software Subscriptions Gross
    Margins

— Software subscriptions gross
    margins increased slightly to 99.4% for fiscal 2006, from 99.1%
    for fiscal 2005 due primarily to improved headcount utilization
    and a larger installed base renewals, upgrades and an increasing
    number of new enterprise customers.

Service Gross Margins

— Service gross
    margins increased to 25.9% in fiscal 2006 compared to 19.4% in
    fiscal 2005. Cost of service revenue increased by 36.9% to
    $185.0 million in fiscal 2006, from $135.2 million in
    fiscal 2005.

The improvement in service gross margins for fiscal 2006
    compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to an increase in
    services revenue and improved headcount utilization offset by
    the continued spending in our service infrastructure to support
    our increasing enterprise customer base. This spending included
    additional professional support engineers, increased support
    center activities, and global service partnership programs.
    Service gross margins will typically experience some variability
    over time due to the timing of technical support service
    initiations, renewals and additional investments in our customer
    support infrastructure. In fiscal 2007, we expect service gross
    margins to be in the mid 20% range, as we continue to build out
    our service capability and capacity to support our growing
    enterprise customers and new products. Our fiscal 2007 total
    gross margin will also be negatively impacted by stock
    compensation expenses as a result of the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R.

Sales and Marketing

— Sales and marketing
    expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions, advertising
    and promotional expenses, and certain customer service and
    support costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased 27.7% to
    $595.2 million for fiscal 2006, from $466.0 million
    for fiscal 2005. These expenses were 28.9% and 29.1% of total
    revenues for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. The
    increase in absolute dollars was attributed to increased
    commission expenses resulting from increased revenues, higher
    performance-based payroll expenses due to higher profitability,
    higher partner program expenses, and the continued worldwide
    investment in our sales and global service organizations
    associated with selling complete enterprise solutions.

Amortization of acquisitions-related trademarks/tradenames and
    customer contracts and relationships included in sales and
    marketing expenses was $2.1 million and $0.8 million
    for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. Estimated future
    amortization of trademarks, tradenames, customer contracts, and
    relationships relating to acquisitions and included in sales and
    marketing expenses will be $2.3 million for fiscal 2007,
    $2.2 million for fiscal 2008, 2009, and 2010,
    $1.3 million for fiscal 2011 and $0.3 million
    thereafter.

Sales and marketing headcount increased to 1,927 at
    April 30, 2006, from 1,918 at April 30, 2005. We
    expect to continue to selectively add sales capacity in an
    effort to expand domestic and international markets, introduce
    new products, establish and expand new distribution channels,
    and increase product and company awareness. Our sales and market
    expenses will also increase as a result of the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R. We expect to increase our sales and
    marketing expenses commensurate with future revenue growth.

Research and Development

— Research and
    development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits,
    prototype expenses, non-recurring engineering charges, fees paid
    to outside consultants and amortization of capitalized patents.

Research and development expenses increased 42.1% to
    $243.0 million for fiscal 2006 from $171.0 million for
    fiscal 2005. These expenses represented 11.8% and 10.7% of total
    revenues for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in
    research and development expenses was primarily a result of
    increased headcount, ongoing operating impact of the
    acquisitions, ongoing support of current and future product
    development and enhancement efforts, and higher
    performance-based payroll expenses due to higher profitability.
    Research and development



headcount increased to 1,246 as of April 30, 2006, compared
    to 827 as of April 30, 2005. For both fiscal 2006 and 2005,
    no software development costs were capitalized.

Included in research and development expenses is amortization of
    acquired patents of $2.0 million and $1.8 million for
    fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Based on acquired patents
    existing at April 30, 2006, estimated future capitalized
    patents amortization expenses will be $2.0 million for each
    of the fiscal years 2007 and 2008, respectively, and $0.5 and
    $0.2 million for fiscal 2009 and 2010.

We believe that our future performance will depend in large part
    on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line,
    develop new products that achieve market acceptance, maintain
    technological competitiveness, and meet an expanding range of
    customer requirements. We expect to continuously support current
    and future product development and enhancement efforts, and
    incur prototyping expenses and nonrecurring engineering charges
    associated with the development of new products and
    technologies. We intend to continuously broaden our existing
    product offerings and introduce new products that expand our
    solutions portfolio.

We believe that our research and development expenses will
    increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2007, primarily due to
    ongoing costs associated with the development of new products
    and technologies, projected headcount growth, the operating
    impact of potential future acquisitions as compared to fiscal
    2006, and stock-based compensation as a result of the adoption
    of SFAS No. 123R.

General and Administrative

— General and
    administrative expenses increased 19.4% to $91.9 million
    for fiscal 2006, from $76.9 million for fiscal 2005. These
    expenses represented 4.4% and 4.8% of total revenues for fiscal
    2006 and 2005, respectively. This increase in absolute dollars
    was primarily due to expenses associated with expanded
    regulatory requirements, higher legal expenses and professional
    fees for general corporate matters including patents and higher
    performance-based payroll expenses due to higher profitability.

General and administrative headcount increased to 568 at
    April 30, 2006, from 331 at April 30, 2005. We believe
    that our general and administrative expenses will increase in
    absolute dollars for fiscal 2007 due to projected G&A
    headcount growth and the stock-based compensation as a result of
    the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Amortization of
    acquisitions-related covenants not to compete included in
    general and administrative expenses was $2.2 million and
    $5.1 million for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Estimated future amortization of covenants not to compete
    relating to acquisitions will be $1.0 million for fiscal
    year 2007, and $0.2 million in fiscal year 2008.

In-Process Research and Development

— We
    recorded in-process research and development charges of
    $5.0 million in fiscal 2006 related to the acquisition of
    Decru. The purchase price of the transaction was allocated to
    the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated
    fair values as of the date of the acquisition. Approximately
    $5.0 million was allocated to in-process research and
    development and charged to operations because the acquired
    technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no
    alternative uses. The value was determined by estimating the
    costs to develop the acquired in-process technology into
    commercially viable products, estimating the resulting future
    net cash flows from such projects, and discounting the net cash
    flows back to their present value. The discount rate included a
    factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the
    successful development of the acquired in-process technology.
    These estimates are subject to change, given the uncertainties
    of the development process, and no assurance can be given that
    deviations from these estimates will not occur. Research and
    development costs to bring the products from Decru to
    technological feasibility are not expected to have a material
    impact on our future results of operations or financial
    conditions.

Stock Compensation

— Stock compensation
    expenses were $13.3 million and $8.1 million for
    fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. This net increase in

year-over-year

stock compensation expenses reflected primarily higher stock
    compensation relating to stock options and restricted stocks
    assumed in acquisitions, and restricted stock awards, partially
    offset by forfeitures of unvested options and forfeited
    restricted stock assumed in the acquisitions. Based on deferred
    stock compensation recorded at April 30, 2006, estimated
    future deferred stock compensation amortization expenses,
    excluding the impact of SFAS No. 123R, are
    $20.3 million in fiscal 2007, $14.3 million in fiscal
    2008, $8.1 million in fiscal 2009, and $6.6 million in
    fiscal 2010.

Restructuring Charges

— In fiscal 2002, as
    a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a
    reduction in IT spending rates, we implemented two restructuring
    plans, which included reductions in our workforce and
    consolidations of our facilities. As of April 30, 2006, we
    have no outstanding balance in our



restructuring liability for the first restructuring. The second
    restructuring related to the closure of an engineering facility
    and consolidation of resources to the Sunnyvale headquarters. In
    the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we implemented a third
    restructuring plan related to the move of our global services
    center operations from Sunnyvale to our new flagship support
    center at our Research Triangle Park facility in North Carolina.

Our restructuring estimates are reviewed and revised
    periodically and may result in a substantial charge or reduction
    to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail
    than were anticipated in previous management estimates. Such
    estimates included various assumptions such as the time period
    over which the facilities will be vacant, expected sublease
    terms, and expected sublease rates. In fiscal 2006, we recorded
    a reduction in restructuring reserve of $1.3 million
    resulting from the execution of a new sublease agreement for our
    Tewksbury facility. In fiscal 2006, we recorded a restructuring
    charge of $1.1 million, primarily attributed to
    severance-related amounts and relocation expenses related to the
    third restructuring plan.

Of the reserve balance at April 30, 2006, $0.9 million
    was included in other accrued liabilities and the remaining
    $2.1 million was classified as long-term obligations. The
    balance of the reserve is expected to be paid by fiscal 2011.

The following analysis sets forth the significant components of
    the second restructuring at April 30, 2006

Interest Income

— Interest income was
    $41.5 million and $24.2 million for fiscal 2006 and
    2005, respectively. Included in interest income for fiscal 2005
    was a $1.3 million interest received on a tax refund. The
    increase in interest income was primarily driven by higher
    average interest rates on our investment portfolio. We expect
    interest income to increase for fiscal 2007 as a result of
    rising average interest rates and higher cash and invested
    balances in a higher interest-rate portfolio environment.

Interest Expense

— Interest expense was
    $1.3 million and $0.1 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The increase in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to
    interest incurred in connection with our debt.

Other Income (Expense), Net

— Other Income
    (Expense), Net, included net exchange gains from foreign
    currency transactions of $1.7 million in fiscal 2006, due
    primarily to forecast variances offset by hedging costs as a
    result of higher U.S. interest rates compared to other
    countries. Net exchange losses from foreign currency
    transactions were $1.6 million in fiscal 2005 as a result
    of exchange rate volatility, forecast variances and higher
    hedging costs.

Provision for Income Taxes

— The provision
    for income taxes for fiscal 2006 included an income tax
    provision of $22.5 million or $0.06 per share
    associated with the repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings
    which occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 under
    the one-time incentive created pursuant to Section 965 of
    the Jobs Act. We will invest these earnings pursuant to an
    approved Domestic Reinvestment Plan that conforms to the Jobs
    Act guidelines.



For fiscal 2006, we had an effective tax rate of 23.9% to pretax
    income, which included a 6.4% increase to account for the income
    tax provision of $22.5 million associated with the cash
    repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings. The effective tax
    rate for fiscal 2006 differed from the U.S. statutory rate
    primarily due to a beneficial foreign tax ruling for our
    principal European subsidiary, the availability of tax credits,
    and the generation of foreign earnings in lower tax
    jurisdictions. For fiscal 2005, our effective tax rate was 18.3%.

Fiscal
    2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004

Product Revenues

— Product revenues
    increased by 33.4% to $1,260.6 million in fiscal 2005, from
    $944.9 million in fiscal 2004. Product revenues growth was
    across all geographies. This increase in product revenues was
    specifically attributable to increased software licenses and an
    increase in units shipped, compared to the prior year.

Product revenues were favorably affected by the following
    factors:

•

Increased revenues from our then current products such as:
    FAS960, FAS940, FAS270, and FAS250 storage systems; NearStore
    R200 and R150 nearline storage systems; NetCache C2100 and C6200
    appliances, as well as our gateway storage systems (gFiler),
    GF960, GF940 and GF825

•

Increased revenues from data management software products that
    are focused on solving enterprise customer storage challenges,
    including regulatory and compliance data needs, storage
    consolidation, Internet access and security, technical
    applications, and data protection

•

Increased demand for regulatory compliance WORM solutions and

backup-to-disk

solutions

•

Increased sales through indirect channels, including sales
    through our resellers, distributors, and OEM partners,
    representing 51.2% and 47.9% of total revenues for fiscal 2005
    and 2004, respectively.

Product revenues were negatively affected by the following
    factors:

•

Lower-cost-per-megabyte disks which are a significant component
    of our hardware costs. As performance has improved on these
    devices, the related sales price we can charge per megabyte of
    storage has decreased as well.

•

Incremental revenue due to an extra week of business in fiscal
    2004 compared to fiscal 2005

•

Declining average selling price and unit sales of our older
    storage systems.

Software Subscriptions Revenues

— Software
    subscriptions revenues increased by 49.8% to $169.7 million
    in fiscal 2005, from $113.3 million in fiscal 2004 due
    primarily to a larger installed base renewals, upgrades and an
    increasing number of new enterprise customers. Software
    subscription revenues represent 10.6% and 9.7% of total revenues
    for fiscal year 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Service Revenues

— Service revenues, which
    include hardware support, professional services, and educational
    services, increased by 49.7% to $167.8 million in fiscal
    2005, from $112.1 million in fiscal 2004. Service revenues
    are generally deferred and, in most cases, recognized ratably
    over the service obligation periods, which are typically one to
    three years. Service revenues represented 10.5%, and 9.6% of
    total revenues for fiscal year 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
    increase in absolute dollars was due to an increasing number of
    enterprise customers, which typically purchase more complete and
    generally longer-term service packages. Higher service revenues
    were also related to a growing installed base resulting in new
    customer support contracts in addition to support contract
    renewals by existing customers.

International Total
    Revenues

— International total revenues
    (including U.S. exports) increased by 39.0% in fiscal year
    2005 compared with fiscal 2004. International total revenues
    were $765.8 million, or 47.9% of total revenues for fiscal
    year 2005 compared with $551.0 million or 47.1% of total
    revenues for fiscal 2004. The increase in international sales
    for fiscal year 2005 was primarily a result of revenue growth
    from our European and Asia Pacific geography, driven by larger
    storage implementations, increased demand for our solutions
    portfolio, new customers, and higher storage spending in certain
    geographic regions, as compared to the same period in the prior
    fiscal year.



Product Gross Margins

— Product gross
    margins increased to 61.4% for fiscal 2005, from 60.8% for
    fiscal 2004. Amortization of existing technology included in
    cost of product revenues was $3.4 million and
    $3.7 million for fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Product gross margins were favorably affected by the following
    factors:

•

Favorable product and add-on software mix

•

Competitive pricing solutions with our bundled software and
    solutions set

•

Higher average selling prices for our newer products

•

Growth in software subscription upgrades and software licenses
    due primarily to a larger installed base and an increasing
    number of new enterprise customers

•

Transitional expenses incurred in fiscal 2004 associated with
    the initial implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning
    (ERP) system, which we did not incur in fiscal 2005

Product gross margins were negatively affected by the following
    factors:

•

Higher disk content with an expanded storage capacity for the
    higher-end storage systems and NearStore systems, as resale of
    disk drives generates lower gross margins

•

Increased sales through certain indirect channels, which
    typically carry lower gross margins than our direct sales

•

Sales price reductions due to competitive pricing pressure and
    selective pricing discounts

•

Lower average selling price of certain add-on software options

Software Subscriptions Gross
    Margins

— Software Subscriptions gross
    margins increased to 99.1% for fiscal 2005, from 98.9% for
    fiscal 2004 due primarily to improved headcount utilization and
    a larger installed base renewals, upgrades and an increasing
    number of new enterprise customers.

Service Gross Margins

— Service gross
    margins increased to 19.4% in fiscal 2005 as compared to 15.9%
    in fiscal 2004. Cost of service revenue increased by 43.4% to
    $135.2 million in fiscal 2005, from $94.3 million in
    fiscal 2004. The improvement in service gross margins for fiscal
    2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to an increase in
    services revenue and improved headcount utilization offset by
    the continued spending in our service infrastructure to support
    our increasing enterprise customer base. This spending included
    additional professional support engineers, increased support
    center activities, and global service partnership programs.
    Service gross margins will typically experience some variability
    over time due to the timing of technical support service
    initiations and renewals and additional investments in our
    customer support infrastructure.

Sales and Marketing

— Sales and marketing
    expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions, advertising
    and promotional expenses, and certain global service and support
    costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased 33.3% to
    $466.0 million for fiscal 2005, from $349.5 million
    for fiscal 2004. These expenses were 29.1% and 29.9% of total
    revenues for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. The
    increase in absolute dollars was attributed to increased
    commission expenses resulting from increased revenues, higher
    performance-based payroll expenses due to higher profitability,
    higher sales kickoff expenses, higher partner program expenses,
    and the continued worldwide spending in our sales and global
    service organizations associated with selling complete
    enterprise solutions, partially offset by an extra week of
    business in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2005.

Amortization of acquired trademarks/tradenames and customer
    contracts, and relationships included in sales and marketing
    expenses was $0.8 million and $0.2 million for fiscal
    2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively.

Sales and marketing headcount increased to 1,918 at
    April 30, 2005, from 1,421 at April 30, 2004.

Research and Development

— Research and
    development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits,
    prototype expenses, nonrecurring engineering charges, fees paid
    to outside consultants and amortization of capitalized patents.
    Research and development expenses increased 29.7% to
    $171.0 million for fiscal 2005 from $131.9 million for
    fiscal 2004. These expenses represented 10.7% and 11.3% of total
    revenues for fiscal 2005 and



2004, respectively. The increase in research and development
    expenses was primarily a result of increased headcount, ongoing
    impact of the Spinnaker acquisition, ongoing support of current
    and future product development and enhancement efforts, higher
    performance-based payroll expenses due to higher profitability,
    partially offset by an extra week of expenses in fiscal 2004
    compared to fiscal 2005, cost control, and reduction in
    discretionary spending efforts. Research and development
    headcount increased to 827 as of April 30, 2005, compared
    to 650 as of April 30, 2004. For both fiscal 2005 and 2004,
    no software development costs were capitalized. Included in
    research and development expenses is capitalized patents
    amortization of $1.8 million and $1.5 million for
    fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively.

General and Administrative

— General and
    administrative expenses increased 41.0% to $76.9 million
    for fiscal 2005, from $54.6 million for fiscal 2004. These
    expenses represented 4.8% and 4.7% of total revenues for fiscal
    2005 and 2004, respectively. This increase in absolute dollars
    was primarily due to expenses associated with expanded
    regulatory requirements, higher legal expenses and professional
    fees for general corporate matters including patents, higher
    performance-based payroll expenses due to higher profitability,
    partially offset by reduced expenses as a result of one less
    week of expenses in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and
    higher expenses associated with investments in our
    enterprise-wide ERP system and back-office infrastructure in
    fiscal 2004, which we did not incur in fiscal 2005.

General and administrative headcount increased to 432 at
    April 30, 2005, from 331 at April 30, 2004.
    Amortization of Spinnaker covenants not to compete included in
    general and administrative expenses was $5.1 million and
    $1.1 million for fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Stock Compensation

— Stock compensation
    expenses were $8.1 million and $3.9 million for fiscal
    2005 and 2004, respectively. This net increase

year-over-year

in stock compensation expenses reflected primarily higher stock
    compensation relating to stock options and restricted stocks
    assumed in the Spinnaker acquisition, restricted stock awards,
    partially offset by forfeitures of unvested options and
    forfeited restricted stock assumed in the Spinnaker acquisition.

Restructuring Charges

— In fiscal 2002, as
    a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a
    reduction in IT spending rates, we implemented two restructuring
    plans, which included reductions in our workforce and
    consolidations of our facilities. During fiscal 2005, we paid
    $0.6 million pursuant to final resolution of certain
    severance-related restructuring accruals. As of April 30,
    2005, we have no outstanding balance in our restructuring
    liability for the first restructuring. The second restructuring
    related to the closure of an engineering facility and
    consolidation of resources to the Sunnyvale headquarters. Of the
    reserve balance at April 30, 2005, $0.8 million was
    included in other accrued liabilities and the remaining
    $3.7 million was classified as long-term obligations.

Interest Income

— Interest income was
    $24.2 million and $13.7 million for fiscal 2005 and
    2004, respectively. Included in interest income for fiscal 2005
    was $1.3 million interest received on a tax refund. In
    addition, the increase in interest income was primarily driven
    by higher cash and investment balances provided by operating
    activities and higher average interest rates on our investment
    portfolio.

Other Income (Expense), Net

— Other Income
    (Expense), Net, included net exchange losses from foreign
    currency transactions of $1.6 million and $2.9 million
    in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. The net exchange loss was
    a result of the volatility of the currency exchange market and
    increased hedging costs associated with our forward and option
    activities.

Provision for Income Taxes

— For fiscal
    2005, we had an effective tax rate of 18.3% to pretax income.
    The effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 differed from the
    U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a beneficial foreign
    tax ruling for our principal European subsidiary, the
    availability of tax credits, and the generation of foreign
    earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. For fiscal 2004, our
    effective tax rate was 10.8% which included 9.9% reduction to
    account for the $16.8 million benefit from the retroactive
    portion of foreign tax ruling.



Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our
    balance sheet and cash flows, contractual obligations and other
    commercial commitments, stock repurchase program, capital
    commitments, other sources and uses of cash flows and tax
    opportunities on our liquidity and capital resources.

Balance
    Sheet and Other Cash Flows

As of April 30, 2006, compared to April 30, 2005, our
    cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased by
    $152.9 million to $1,322.9 million. We derive our
    liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flows
    from operations and from working capital. Working capital
    increased by $60.3 million to $1,116.0 million as of
    April 30, 2006, compared to $1,055.7 million as of
    April 30, 2005.

During fiscal 2006, we recorded cash flows from operating
    activities of $554.3 million as compared with
    $462.1 million and $313.0 million for fiscal 2005 and
    fiscal 2004, respectively. The largest driver of this increase
    was fiscal 2006 net income of $266.5 million as
    compared to $225.8 million and $152.1 million in
    fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. Noncash adjustments
    were higher in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, including
    depreciation, which was higher by $9.2 million due to
    worldwide facilities expansion; amortization of intangible
    assets, which was higher by $6.8 million; stock
    compensation, which was higher by $5.1 million, and
    acquired in-process research and development of
    $5.0 million. The increase in these acquisition-related
    non-cash charges was related to the Decru and Alacritus
    acquisitions during fiscal 2006. In addition to higher net
    income and noncash adjustments in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal
    2005 and fiscal 2004, the primary factors that impacted the

period-to-period

change in cash flows relating to operating activities included
    the following:

•

An increase in deferred revenues from higher software
    subscription and service billings attributable to our continuing
    shift toward larger enterprise customers, as well as increasing
    renewals of existing maintenance agreements in fiscal 2006
    compared to fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004

•

An increase in accounts payable in fiscal 2005, compared to
    fiscal 2006 and 2004, primarily attributable to elevated
    purchasing activity in fiscal 2005 required to support our
    business growth and facilities expansion projects

•

Increased income taxes payable in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal
    2005 and 2004, primarily reflecting the $22.5 million of
    federal and state income tax liability relating to the
    repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under the Jobs Act
    and higher profitability in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005
    and 2004

The above factors were partially offset by the effects of the
    following:

•

Increased accounts receivable balances due to increased sales in
    fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, and a
    shipping profile weighted towards the second half of the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2006

•

An increase in inventories in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal
    2005 due primarily to higher consigned inventory for IBM sales,
    new products at customer sites and configured units to meet
    revenue growth and an increase in fiscal 2005 inventories
    compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to

end-of-life

buys for certain products

•

An increase in prepaid expenses and other assets in fiscal 2006
    and fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2005
    prepaid expenses included a tax refund of $9.0 million in
    connection with a carryback of net operating losses generated in
    fiscal 2000

We expect that cash provided by operating activities may
    fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors,
    including fluctuations in our operating results, shipment
    linearity, accounts receivable collections, inventory
    management, and the timing of tax and other payments.

Cash used in investing activities was $326.0 million in
    fiscal 2006 as compared to $351.3 million and
    $259.8 million in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004,
    respectively. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 were
    $132.9 million, compared to $93.6 million and
    $48.7 million in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively.
    We used net proceeds of $128.5 million,
    $266.8 million, and $191.7 million in fiscal 2006,
    2005, and 2004, respectively, for net purchases/redemptions of
    short-term investments. In fiscal 2006, we acquired Alacritus
    and Decru and incurred total cash



payments including related transactions costs totaling
    $53.7 million. In fiscal 2004, we incurred
    $8.0 million on related transactions costs and assumed
    $1.2 million relating to the Spinnaker acquisition. In
    fiscal 2005 and 2004, we acquired additional patents for a
    purchase price of approximately $0.9 million and
    $9.0 million, respectively. Investing activities in fiscal
    2006, 2005, and 2004 also included new investments in privately
    held companies of $9.3 million, $0.4 million and
    $0.9 million, respectively. We received $0.1 million,
    $0.3 million, and $1.1 million in proceeds from sales
    of investments in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
    Under a split dollar insurance arrangement with our CEO entered
    in May 2000, we paid total premiums of $10.2 million,
    including $0.2 million and $3.9 million for fiscal
    years 2005, and 2004, respectively. In April 2005, our CEO
    reimbursed us $10.2 million for these premiums.

Cash provided by financing activities was $42.8 million in
    fiscal 2006 as compared to cash used in financing activities of
    $12.1 million and $54.6 million in fiscal 2005 and
    fiscal 2004, respectively. During fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, we
    repurchased 17.4 million, 7.7 million and
    6.9 million shares of common stock at a total of
    $488.9 million, $192.9 million and
    $136.2 million, respectively. Other financing activities
    provided $232.7 million, $181.9 million, and
    $81.5 million in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively,
    which related to sales of common stock from employee stock
    transactions. Pursuant to the provisions of our Stock Option
    plans, we allowed optionees to satisfy withholding tax
    obligations by electing to have us withhold from the shares to
    be issued upon exercise of a restricted stock the equivalent
    shares having a fair market value equal to $1.1 million in
    withholding taxes in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 to cover
    for federal, state, and local withholding taxes. During fiscal
    2006, we borrowed $300.0 million to fund the repatriation
    in cash from foreign earnings and investments under the Jobs Act.

The change in cash flows from financing activities was primarily
    due to the effects of higher common stock repurchases partially
    offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee
    programs compared to the same periods in the prior year. Net
    proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee
    participation in employee stock programs have historically been
    a significant component of our liquidity. The extent to which
    our employees participate in these programs generally increases
    or decreases based upon changes in the market price of our
    common stock. As a result, our cash flows resulting from the
    issuance of common stock related to employee participation in
    employee stock programs will vary.

Stock
    Repurchase Program

Through April 30, 2006, the Board of Directors had
    authorized the repurchase of up to $650.0 million in shares
    of our outstanding common stock. At April 30, 2006,
    $405.7 million remained available for future repurchases.
    The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at
    any time.

Other
    Sources and Uses of Cash and Tax Opportunities

The Jobs Act created a one-time incentive for
    U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned
    abroad by providing an 85% dividend-received deduction for
    certain dividends from certain

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we repatriated
    $405.5 million of accumulated foreign earnings and recorded
    a $22.5 million federal and state income tax liability upon
    the remittance of these foreign earnings.

For fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, we recorded tax benefits, in
    the form of reduced payments, of $42.2 million,
    $27.8 million, and $49.5 million, respectively,
    associated with disqualifying dispositions of employee stock
    options. If stock option exercise patterns change, we may
    receive less cash from stock option exercises and may not
    receive the same level of tax benefits in the future, which
    could cause our cash payments for income taxes to increase.

Debt

In March 2006, we received proceeds of the term loans totaling
    $300.0 million to finance a dividend under the Jobs Act.
    (See Note 6). The loan repayments of $166.2 million
    and $133.8 million are due in fiscal 2007 and 2008,
    respectively. This debt was collateralized by restricted
    investments totaling $241.2 million, as well as certain
    foreign receivables. In accordance with the payment terms of the
    loan agreement, interest payments will be approximately
    $12.4 million and $4.1 million in fiscal 2007 and
    2008, respectively. As of April 30, 2006, we are in
    compliance with the liquidity and leverage ratio as required by
    the Loan Agreement with the lenders.



Contractual
    Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments

For purposes of the above table, contractual obligations for the
    purchase of goods and services are defined as agreements that
    are enforceable, legally binding on us, and subject us to
    penalties if we cancel the agreement. Some of the figures we
    include in this table are based on management’s estimates
    and assumptions about these obligations, including their
    duration, the possibility of renewal or termination, anticipated
    actions by third parties, and other factors. Because these
    estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the
    enforceable and legally binding obligations we will actually pay
    in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table.

We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business.
    We lease sales offices, research and development facilities, and
    other property under operating leases throughout the U.S. and
    internationally, which expire through fiscal 2015. Substantially
    all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the
    passage of time and contain escalation clauses. Some lease
    agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or to
    terminate the lease. Our future operating lease obligations
    would change if we were to exercise these options or if we were
    to enter into additional operating lease agreements. Sublease
    income of $0.03 million has been included as a reduction of
    the payment amounts shown in the table. Facilities operating
    lease payments exclude the leases impacted by the
    restructurings. The amounts for the leases impacted by the
    restructurings are included in subparagraph (7) below.

(2)

On December 16, 2005, we entered into financing,
    construction and leasing arrangements with BNP for office space
    to be located on land currently owned by us in Sunnyvale,
    California. This arrangements requires us to lease our land to
    BNP for a period of 50 years to construct approximately
    190,000 square feet of office space costing up to
    $38.5 million. After completion of construction, we will
    pay minimum lease payments which vary based on London Interbank
    Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread (5.58% at
    April 30, 2006) on the cost of the facilities. We
    expect to begin paying lease payments on the completed buildings
    on September 2007 for a term of five years. We have the option
    to renew the lease for two consecutive five-year periods upon
    approval by BNP.



Capital
    Expenditure Requirements

We expect capital expenditures to increase in the future
    consistent with the growth in our business, as we continue to
    invest in people, land, buildings, capital equipment and
    enhancements to our worldwide infrastructure. We expect that our
    existing facilities and those being developed in Sunnyvale,
    California; RTP, North Carolina; and worldwide are adequate for
    our requirements over at least the next two years and that
    additional space will be available as needed. We expect to
    finance these construction projects, including our commitments
    under facilities and equipment operating leases, and any
    required capital expenditures over the next few years through
    cash from operations and existing cash, cash equivalents and
    investments.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

As of April 30, 2006, our financial guarantees of
    $1.8 million that were not recorded on our balance sheet
    consisted of standby letters of credit related to workers’
    compensation, a customs guarantee, a corporate credit card
    program, and a foreign lease.

As of April 30, 2006, our notional fair values of foreign
    exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled
    $345.1 million. We do not believe that these derivatives
    present significant credit risks because the counterparties to
    the derivatives consist of major financial institutions, and we
    manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any
    one counterparty. We do not enter into derivative financial
    instruments for



speculative or trading purposes. Other than the risk associated
    with the financial condition of the counterparties, our maximum
    exposure related to foreign currency forward and option
    contracts is limited to the premiums paid.

We have entered into indemnification agreements with third
    parties in the ordinary course of business. Generally, these
    indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses
    suffered by the third party due to various events, such as
    lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement. These
    indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet
    arrangements in accordance with FASB, Interpretation 45, of
    FIN 45,

“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
    Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
    Indebtedness of Others.”

See “Guarantees” in
    footnote 15 for further discussion of these indemnification
    agreements.

We have commitments related to a lease arrangement with BNP for
    approximately 190,000 square feet of office space to be
    located on land currently owned by us in Sunnyvale, California
    (as further described above under “Contractual Cash
    Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments”). We have
    evaluated our accounting for this lease under the provisions of
    FIN 46R, and have determined the following:

•

BNP is a leasing company for BNP Paribas in the U.S. BNP is
    not a “special purpose entity” organized for the sole
    purpose of facilitating the lease to us. The obligation to
    absorb expected losses and receive expected residual returns
    rests with the parent BNP Paribas. Therefore, we are not the
    primary beneficiary of BNP as we do not absorb the majority of
    BNP’s expected losses or expected residual returns; and

•

BNP has represented in the Closing Agreement (filed as Exhibit
    10.40) that the fair value of the property leased to us by BNP
    is less than half of the total of the fair values of all assets
    of BNP, excluding any assets of BNP held within a silo. Further,
    the property leased to Network Appliance is not held within a
    silo. The definition of “held within a silo” means
    that BNP has obtained funds equal to or in excess of 95% of the
    fair value of the leased asset to acquire or maintain its
    investment in such asset through non-recourse financing or other
    contractual arrangements, the effect of which is to leave such
    asset (or proceeds thereof) as the only significant asset of BNP
    at risk for the repayment of such funds.

Accordingly, under the current FIN 46R standard, we are not
    required to consolidate either the leasing entity or the
    specific assets that we lease under the BNP lease. Assuming this
    transaction will continue to meet the provisions of FIN 46R
    as new standards evolve over time, our future minimum lease
    payments under this real estates lease will amount to a total of
    $43.5 million reported under our Note 4
    “Commitments and Contingencies”.

As of April 30, 2006, except for operating leases and other
    contractual obligations outlined under the “Contractual
    Cash Obligations” table, we do not have any off-balance
    sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, retained or
    contingent interests in transferred assets, or any obligation
    arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated
    entity. We also do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that
    are not included in the consolidated financial statements.
    Additionally, we do not have any interest in or relationship
    with, any special purpose entities.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resource Requirements

Key factors affecting our cash flows include our ability to
    effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts
    receivable and inventories and future demand for our products
    and related pricing. We expect to incur higher capital
    expenditures in the near future to expand our operations. We
    will from time to time acquire products and businesses
    complementary to our business. In the future, we may continue to
    repurchase our common stock, which would reduce cash, cash
    equivalents,

and/or

short-term investments available to fund future operations and
    meet other liquidity requirements. Based on past performance and
    current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash
    equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated from
    operations will satisfy our working capital needs, capital
    expenditures, stock repurchases, contractual obligations, and
    other liquidity requirements associated with our operations.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in
    interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We use
    certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks.
    We do not use derivative financial instruments for



speculative or trading purposes. All financial instruments are
    used in accordance with management-approved policies.

Market
    Interest and Interest Income Risk

Interest and Investment Income

— As of
    April 30, 2006, we had

available-for-sale

investments of $1,102.8 million. Our investment portfolio
    primarily consists of highly liquid investments with original
    maturities at the date of purchase of greater than three months,
    which are classified as available for sale. These highly liquid
    investments, consisting primarily of government, municipal,
    corporate debt, and auction-rate securities, are subject to
    interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in
    value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 10%
    increase in market interest rates from levels at April 30,
    2006, would cause the fair value of these short-term investments
    to decline by approximately $3.5 million. Because we have
    the ability to hold these investments until maturity, we would
    not expect any significant decline in value of our investments
    caused by market interest rate changes. Declines in interest
    rates over time will, however, reduce our interest income. We do
    not use derivative financial instruments in our investment
    portfolio.

Lease Commitments

— As of April 30,
    2006, we have arrangements with BNP to lease our land for a
    period of 50 years to construct approximately
    190,000 square feet of office space costing up to
    $38.5 million. After completion of construction, we will
    pay minimum lease payments which vary based on London Interbank
    Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread. We expect to pay
    lease payments on the completed buildings from BNP on September
    2007 for a term of five years. We have the option to renew the
    lease for two consecutive five-year periods upon approval by
    BNP. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates from
    levels at April 30, 2006, would increase our total lease
    payments under the initial

5-year

term
    by approximately $0.9 million. We do not currently hedge
    against market interest rate increases. As cash from operating
    cash flows are invested in a higher interest rate environment,
    it will offer a natural hedge against interest rate risk from
    our lease commitments in the event of a significant increase in
    market interest rate.

Debt Obligation

— We have an outstanding
    variable rate term loan totaling $300.0 million as of
    April 30, 2006. Under terms of these arrangements, we
    expect to pay interest payments at LIBOR plus a spread. Due to
    the short-term nature of these debt arrangements, a hypothetical
    10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on
    our financial position, results of operations and cash flows
    over the next two fiscal years. We do not currently use
    derivatives to manage interest rate risk.

Equity securities

— We have from time to
    time made cash investments in companies with distinctive
    technologies that are potentially strategically important to us.
    Our investments in non-marketable equity securities would be
    negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market
    prices, although the impact cannot be directly quantified. Such
    a change, or any negative change in the financial performance or
    prospects of the companies whose non-marketable securities we
    own, would harm the ability of these companies to raise
    additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to
    realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity
    events such as initial public offerings, acquisitions and
    private sales. These types of investments involve a high degree
    of risk, and there can be no assurance that any company we
    invest in will grow or be successful. Accordingly, we could lose
    all or part of our investment. Our investments in non-marketable
    equity securities had a carrying amount of $11.0 million as
    of April 30, 2006 and $1.8 million as of
    April 30, 2005. If we determine that an

other-than-temporary

decline in fair value exists for a non-marketable equity
    security, we write down the investment to its fair value and
    record the related write-down as an investment loss in our
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward
    Contracts

We hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to
    minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates on earnings. We utilize forward and option contracts to
    hedge against the short-term impact of foreign currency
    fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in
    foreign currencies. All balance sheet hedges are marked to
    market through earnings every period. We also use foreign
    exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted
    transactions related to certain sales and operating expenses.
    These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under
    SFAS No. 133. For cash flow hedges outstanding at
    April 30, 2006, the gains or losses were included in other
    comprehensive income.



We do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative
    or trading purposes. In entering into forward and option foreign
    exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise
    from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms
    of their contracts. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit
    risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy
    multinational commercial banks. All contracts have a maturity of
    less than one year.

Item 8.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Network Appliance, Inc.

Sunnyvale, California

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Network Appliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of April 30, 2006 and 2005, and the
    related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss) for
    each of the three years in the period ended April 30, 2006.
    Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement
    schedule listed in Item 15(a)(2). These financial
    statements and the financial statement schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
    statements and the financial statement schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    Network Appliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of
    April 30, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended April 30, 2006 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Also, in our opinion, the consolidated financial
    statement schedule listed in Item 15(a)(2), when considered
    in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of April 30, 2006, based on the
    criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    and our report dated July 11, 2006 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and
    an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except per-share
    data)

1.

The
    Company

Based in Sunnyvale, California, Network Appliance was
    incorporated in California in April 1992 and reincorporated in
    Delaware in November 2001. Network Appliance, Inc.
    (“we” or “the Company”) is a leading
    supplier of enterprise storage and data management software and
    hardware products and services. Our solutions help global
    enterprises meet major information technology challenges such as
    managing storage growth, assuring secure and timely information
    access, protecting data and controlling costs by providing
    innovative solutions that simplify the complexity associated
    with managing corporate data. Network Appliance solutions are
    the data management and storage foundation for many of the
    world’s leading corporations and government agencies.

2.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Fiscal Year

— We operate on a

52-week

or

53-week

year
    ending on the last Friday in April. For presentation purposes we
    have indicated in the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements that our fiscal year end is April 30. Fiscal
    2006 and 2005 were

52-week

fiscal years. Fiscal 2004 was

53-week

fiscal year.

Basis of Presentation

— The consolidated
    financial statements include the Company and its wholly-owned
    subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions are
    eliminated in consolidation.

Risk and Uncertainties

— There are no
    concentrations of business transacted with a particular customer
    nor concentrations of sales from a particular market or
    geographic area that would severely impact our business in the
    near term. However, we currently rely on a limited number of
    suppliers for certain key components and several key contract
    manufacturers to manufacture most of our products; any
    disruption or termination of these arrangements could materially
    adversely affect our operating results.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— We consider
    all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities of
    three months or less to be cash equivalents at time of purchase.

Available-for-Sale

Investments

— Available-for-sale

investments with original maturities of greater than three
    months are classified as short-term investments as these
    investments generally consist of highly marketable securities
    that are intended to be available to meet current cash
    requirements. All of our investments are classified as

available-for-sale,

are carried at fair market value, and unrealized gains or losses
    are recorded, net of taxes in accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), which is a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity. Any gains or losses on sales of
    investments are computed based upon specific identification. For
    all periods presented, realized gains and losses on

available-for-sale

investments were not material. Management determines the
    appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the
    time of purchase and reevaluates the classification at each
    reporting date. The fair value of our

available-for-sale

investment reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was
    $1,102,787 and $976,423 as of April 30, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

Restricted Investments

— We have

available-for-sale

investments that are pledged as collateral pursuant to the Loan
    agreement entered into with JPMorgan Chase Bank. These
    investments are classified as short-term and long-term
    restricted investment in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in
    accordance with the investment maturity and loan repayment
    schedule.

Investments in Nonpublic Companies

— We
    have certain investments in nonpublicly traded companies in
    which we have less than 20% of the voting rights and in which we
    do not exercise significant influence and accordingly, we
    account for these investments under the cost method. As of
    April 30, 2006 and 2005, $11,020 and $1,837 of these
    investments are included in other long-term assets on the
    balance sheet and are carried at cost. We perform periodic
    reviews of our investments for impairment.

Other-than-temporary

Impairment

— All of our

available-for-sale

investments and non-marketable equity securities are subject to
    a periodic impairment review. Investments are considered to be
    impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be

other-than-temporary.

This determination requires significant judgment. For publicly



NETWORK
    APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

traded investments, impairment is determined based upon the
    specific facts and circumstances present at the time, including
    factors such as current economic and market conditions, the
    credit rating of the security’s issuer, the length of time
    an investment’s fair value has been below our carrying
    value, and our ability to hold investments to maturity. If an
    investment’s decline in fair value, caused by factors other
    than changes in interest rates, is deemed to be

other-than-temporary,

we would reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value,
    as determined based on quoted market prices or liquidation
    values. Declines in value judged to be

other-than-temporary,

if any, are recorded in operations as incurred. For
    non-marketable equity securities, the impairment analysis
    requires the identification of events or circumstances that
    would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value
    of the investment, including, revenue and earnings trends,
    overall business prospects, limited capital resources, limited
    prospects of receiving additional financing, limited prospects
    for liquidity of the related securities and general market
    conditions in the investees’ industry.

Inventories

— Inventories are stated at
    the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out basis) or market. Cost components include materials,
    labor, and manufacturing overhead costs. We write down inventory
    and record purchase commitment liabilities for excess and
    obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of
    inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions
    about future demand and market conditions.

Property and Equipment

— Property and
    equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using
    the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets, which generally range from three to five years. The land
    at the Sunnyvale headquarters site and Research Triangle Park
    (RTP), North Carolina are not depreciated but are reviewed for
    impairment similar to our review of goodwill and intangible
    assets discussed below. Leasehold improvements are amortized
    over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or
    the remaining term of the lease. Building improvements are
    amortized over the estimated lives of the assets, which
    generally range from 10 to 40 years. Construction in
    progress will be amortized over the estimated useful lives of
    the respective assets when they are ready for their intended use.

We review the carrying values of long-lived assets whenever
    events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an
    asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows
    from its use and eventual disposition. The amount of impairment
    loss, if any, is measured as the difference between the net book
    value and the estimated fair value of the asset.

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible
    Assets

— Goodwill and identifiable
    intangibles are accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS No. 141

“Business Combinations”

and SFAS No. 142

“Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets”.

We recorded goodwill and
    identifiable intangibles related to the acquisitions and
    evaluate these items for impairment on an annual basis, or
    sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    carrying values may not be recoverable. If an evaluation is
    required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows
    associated with these assets would be compared to their carrying
    amount to determine if a write-down to fair market value or
    discounted cash flow value is required. We performed an annual
    impairment test of goodwill on February 24, 2006 and
    February 25, 2005, respectively, and found no impairment.

Purchased intangible assets include patents, trademarks,
    tradenames, customer contracts/relationships and covenants not
    to compete, which are carried at cost less accumulated
    amortization. Amortization of purchased intangible assets is
    computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful
    lives of the assets, which generally range from 18 months
    to five years. See Note 14 “Goodwill and Purchased
    Intangible Assets.”

Revenue Recognition and Allowance

— We
    apply the provisions of Statement of Position (“SOP”)

No. 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,”

and related
    interpretations to our product sales because we believe our
    firmware and operating software are essential to the
    functionality of our hardware products. We recognize revenue
    when:

•

Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement
    Exists.

It is our customary practice to have a
    purchase order

and/or

contract prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement from our
    end users, customers, value-added resellers, or distributors.



NETWORK
    APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

Delivery has Occurred.

Our product is
    physically delivered to our customers, generally with standard
    transfer terms such as FOB origin. We typically do not allow for
    restocking rights with any of our value-added resellers or
    distributors. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or
    return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria
    are achieved. If undelivered products or services exist that are
    essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an
    arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred.

•

The Fee is Fixed or Determinable.

Arrangements
    with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms,
    conditions and practices are not considered to be fixed or
    determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized as
    the fees become due and payable. We typically do not allow for
    price-protection rights with any of our value-added resellers or
    distributors.

•

Collection is Probable.

Probability of
    collection is assessed on a

customer-by-customer

basis. Customers are subjected to a credit review process that
    evaluates the customers’ financial position and ultimately
    their ability to pay. If it is determined at the outset of an
    arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our
    review process, revenue is recognized upon cash receipt.

For arrangements with multiple elements, we allocate revenue to
    each element using the residual method. When all of the
    undelivered elements are software-related, this allocation is
    based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the
    undelivered items. When the undelivered elements include
    non-software related items that are only sold as a bundle with
    software related items, this allocation is based on objective
    and reliable evidence of fair value, in accordance with

EITF 00-21.

We defer the portion of the arrangement fee equal to the fair
    value of the undelivered elements until they are delivered.
    Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the
    price charged when the element is sold separately.

A typical arrangement includes product, software subscription,
    and maintenance. Some arrangements include technical consulting
    and training. Software subscriptions represent the right to
    unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a

when-and-if-available

basis, bug fixes, and patch releases. Service maintenance
    includes contracts for technical support and hardware
    maintenance. Revenue from software subscriptions and service
    maintenance is recognized ratably over the contractual term,
    generally one to three years. We typically sell technical
    consulting services and training separately from any of our
    other revenue elements, either on a time and materials basis or
    for fixed price standard projects. The type of work that is
    performed is not essential to the functionality of the software
    or hardware. Accordingly, we recognize revenue as the services
    are performed and in accordance with

EITF 03-05

“Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to
    Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing

More-Than-Incidental

Software”.

Revenue from hardware installation services
    is a non-software deliverable because the software is not
    essential to the functionality of the installation service and
    is therefore outside of the scope of

SOP 97-2.

Revenue from shipping and handling is included in product
    revenue and its related cost included in cost of product revenue.

In prior years, software subscriptions revenue was included as a
    part of product revenue and disclosed separately in our
    footnotes. Beginning in fiscal 2006, this revenue and its
    related cost of revenue have been separately disclosed in our
    income statements, and prior periods have been revised to
    reflect this presentation.

We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at
    the time of shipment. These estimates are based on historical
    sales returns, changes in customer demand, and other factors. If
    actual future returns and allowances differ from past
    experience, additional allowances may be required.

We also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for
    estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility
    of specific customer accounts and the aging of our accounts
    receivable. We analyze accounts receivable and historical bad
    debts, customer concentrations, customer solvency, current
    economic and geographic trends, and changes in customer payment
    terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of the
    allowance for doubtful accounts. Our allowance for doubtful
    accounts as of April 30, 2006 was $2,380, compared to
    $5,445 as of April 30, 2005. If the financial condition of
    our customers deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their
    ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.



NETWORK
    APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Deferred Revenues

— Deferred revenues
    consist primarily of amounts related to software subscriptions
    and other service arrangements.

Software Development Costs

— The costs for
    the development of new software products and substantial
    enhancements to existing software products are expensed as
    incurred until technological feasibility has been established,
    at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in
    accordance with SFAS No. 86,

“Accounting for
    the Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
    Marketed.”

Because we believe our current process for
    developing software is essentially completed concurrently with
    the establishment of technological feasibility, which occurs
    upon the completion of a working model, no costs have been
    capitalized for any of the periods presented. In accordance with
    SOP No.

98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed
    or Obtained for Internal Use,”

the cost of internally
    developed software is capitalized and included in property and
    equipment at the point at which the conceptual formulation,
    design, and testing of possible software project alternatives
    have been completed and management authorizes and commits to
    funding the project. Pilot projects and projects where expected
    future economic benefits are less than probable are not
    capitalized. Internally developed software costs include the
    cost of software tools and licenses used in the development of
    our systems, as well as consulting costs. Completed projects are
    transferred to property and equipment at cost and are amortized
    on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives,
    generally three years. We did not capitalize any software
    development costs in fiscal 2006 and 2005.

Income Taxes

— Deferred income tax assets
    and liabilities are provided for temporary differences that will
    result in future tax deductions or income in future periods, as
    well as the future benefit of tax credit carryforwards. A
    valuation allowance reduces tax assets to their estimated
    realizable value. In years prior to fiscal 2006,
    U.S. income taxes were not provided on that portion of
    unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were expected
    to be reinvested indefinitely. The Jobs Act created a one-time
    incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated
    income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividend-received
    deduction for certain dividends from certain

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we repatriated
    $405.5 million of accumulated foreign earnings and recorded
    a $22.5 million federal and state income tax liability upon
    the remittance of those foreign earnings.

Foreign Currency Translation

— For
    subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency,
    gains and losses resulting from translation of these foreign
    currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are
    recorded within stockholders’ equity as part of accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries where the
    functional currency is the U.S. dollar, gains and losses
    resulting from the process of remeasuring foreign currency
    financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in
    other income (expenses), net.

Derivative Instruments

— We follow
    SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”

as amended.
    Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to
    fair value through earnings. If the derivative is designated as
    a hedge, depending on the nature of the exposure being hedged,
    changes in fair value will either be offset against the change
    in fair value of the hedged items through earnings, or
    recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item
    is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedge
    is recognized in earnings immediately. For all periods
    presented, realized gains and losses on ineffective portion of
    the hedge were not material.

As a result of our significant international operations, we are
    subject to risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates. We
    use derivative financial instruments, principally currency
    forward contracts and currency options, to attempt to minimize
    the impact of exchange rate movements on our balance sheet and
    operating results. Factors that could have an impact on the
    effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of
    forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets. These
    programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the
    impact of currency exchange movements. The maturities of these
    instruments are generally less than one year.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Currently, we do not enter into any foreign exchange forward
    contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments or
    equity investments. Our major foreign currency exchange
    exposures and related hedging programs are described below:

Balance Sheet.

We utilize foreign currency
    forward and options contracts to hedge exchange rate
    fluctuations related to certain foreign assets and liabilities.
    Gains and losses on these derivatives offset gains and losses on
    the assets and liabilities being hedged and the net amount is
    included in earnings. In fiscal 2006, net gains generated by
    hedged assets and liabilities totaled $3,505, which were offset
    by losses on the related derivative instruments of $1,681. In
    fiscal 2005, net gains generated by hedged assets and
    liabilities totaled $4,312, which were offset by losses on the
    related derivative instruments of $5,933. In fiscal 2004, net
    gains generated by hedged assets and liabilities totaled $7,265,
    which were offset by losses on the related derivative
    instruments of $10,115.

The premiums paid on the foreign currency option contracts are
    recognized as a reduction to other income when the contract is
    entered into. Other than the risk associated with the financial
    condition of the counterparties, our maximum exposure related to
    foreign currency options is limited to the premiums paid.

Forecasted Transactions.

We use currency
    forward contracts to hedge exposures related to forecasted sales
    and operating expenses denominated in certain foreign
    currencies. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges
    and in general closely match the underlying forecasted
    transactions in duration. The contracts are carried on the
    balance sheet at fair value and the effective portion of the
    contracts’ gains and losses is recorded as other
    comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs.

If the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur, or it
    becomes probable that they will not occur, the gain or loss on
    the related cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in
    earnings. For fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, we did not
    record any gains or losses related to forecasted transactions
    that did not occur or became improbable.

We measure the effectiveness of hedges of forecasted
    transactions on at least a quarterly basis by comparing the fair
    values of the designated currency forward contracts with the
    fair values of the forecasted transactions. No ineffectiveness
    was recognized in earnings during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004.

As of April 30, 2006 the notional fair values of foreign
    exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled
    $345,067.

We do not believe that these derivatives present significant
    credit risks, because the counterparties to the derivatives
    consist of major financial institutions, and we manage the
    notional amount of contracts entered into with any one
    counterparty. We do not enter into derivative financial
    instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of the
    consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America requires management to establish
    accounting policies which contain estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates.

Concentration of Credit Risk and Allowance for Doubtful
    Accounts

— Financial instruments that
    potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist
    primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments, and
    accounts receivable. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
    investments consist primarily of U.S. government agencies,
    corporate bonds, auction-rate securities and municipal bonds,
    cash accounts held at various banks, and money market funds held
    at several financial institutions. We sell our products
    primarily to large organizations in different industries and
    geographies. Credit risk is mitigated by our credit evaluation
    process and limited payment terms. We do not require collateral
    or other security to support accounts receivable. In addition,
    we maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. In
    entering into forward foreign exchange contracts, we have
    assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of
    counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The
    counterparties

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

to these contracts are major multinational commercial banks, and
    we do not expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults.

Comprehensive Income

— Comprehensive
    income is defined as the change in equity during a period from
    nonowner sources. Comprehensive income for the years ending
    April 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 has been disclosed within the
    consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income (loss).

The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
    at April 30, were as follows:

Net Income per Share

— Basic net income
    per share is computed by dividing income available to common
    stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding for that period. Diluted net income per share is
    computed giving effect to all dilutive potential shares that
    were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common
    shares consist of incremental common shares subject to
    repurchase, common shares issuable upon exercise of stock
    options and restricted stock awards.

The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and
    denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share
    computations for the periods presented:

    average exercise price of $65.34, $52.81, and $47.16
    respectively, were excluded from the diluted net income per
    share computation, as their exercise prices were greater than
    the average market price of the common shares for the periods
    presented and would therefore be antidilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

— We account for
    stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of
    APB No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees,”

and comply with the disclosure provisions
    of SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148,

“Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and



NETWORK

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Disclosures.”

Deferred compensation recognized under
    APB No. 25 is amortized ratably to expense over the vesting
    periods. We account for stock options issued to nonemployees in
    accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and
    EITF

No. 96-18

“Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to
    Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with
    Selling, Goods or Services”

under the

fair-value-based

method.

We adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
    SFAS No. 123, and accordingly, no expense has been
    recognized for options granted to employees under the various
    option plans described under Note 7. We amortize deferred
    stock-based compensation ratably over the vesting periods of the
    applicable stock purchase rights, restricted stocks, and stock
    options, generally four years. Deferred stock compensation under
    APB No. 25 and pro forma net income (loss) under the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123 are adjusted to reflect
    cancellations and forfeitures due to employee terminations as
    they occur.

Had compensation expense been determined based on the fair value
    at the grant date for awards, consistent with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123, our pro forma net income (loss) and pro
    forma net income (loss) per share would be as follows:

The Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in
    estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
    restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option
    pricing models require the input of highly subjective
    assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. We
    use projected volatility rates, which are based upon historical
    volatility rates since our initial public offering trended into
    future years.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

— In
    November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position FSP 115-1 which
    addresses the determination as to when an investment is
    considered impaired, whether that impairment is

other-than-temporary,

and the measurement of an impairment loss. This FSP also
    includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition
    of an

other-than-temporary

impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized
    losses that have not been recognized as

other-than-temporary

impairments. The guidance in this FSP amends Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115,
    “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
    Securities” and APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity
    Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” The
    guidance in FSP 115-1 shall be applied to reporting periods
    beginning after December 15, 2005. We are required to adopt
    FSP 115-1 for fiscal years beginning after May 1, 2006. We
    are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of FSP
    115-1 will have on our consolidated results of operations and
    financial condition but do not expect it to have a material
    impact.

In June 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154
    (“SFAS No. 154”),

Accounting Changes and
    Error Corrections: a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board
    Opinion No. 20 (“APB 20”) and FASB Statement
    No 3.

SFAS No. 154 requires
    retrospective application for voluntary changes in accounting
    principle unless it is impracticable to do so. Retrospective
    application refers to the application of a different accounting
    principle to previously issued financial statements as if that
    principle had always been used. SFAS No. 154’s
    retrospective-application requirement replaces
    APB 20’s requirement to recognize most voluntary
    changes in accounting principle by including in net income of
    the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to
    the new accounting principle. This Statement defines
    retrospective application as the application of a different
    accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that
    principle had always been used or as the adjustment of
    previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in
    the reporting entity. This Statement also redefines restatement
    as the revising of previously issued financial statements to
    reflect the correction of an error. The requirements are
    effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2005 and will only impact the
    consolidated financial statements in periods in which a change
    in accounting principle is made.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151
    “

Inventory Costs”

(SFAS No. 151).
    This statement amends the guidance in ARB No. 43,
    Chapter 4, “Inventory Pricing,” to clarify the
    accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
    freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage).
    SFAS No. 151 requires that those items be



NETWORK
    APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

recognized as current-period charges. In addition, this
    Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overhead
    to costs of conversion be based upon the normal capacity of the
    production facilities. The provisions of SFAS No. 151
    are effective for inventory cost incurred in fiscal years
    beginning after June 15, 2005. As such, we are required to
    adopt these provisions at the beginning of fiscal 2007, which
    begins on May 1, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 151 to have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R.
    Generally, the requirements of SFAS No. 123R are
    similar to those of SFAS No. 123. However,
    SFAS No. 123R requires companies to now recognize all
    share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
    stock options, in their statements of operations based on the
    fair value of the payments. Pro forma disclosure will no longer
    be an alternative. The effective date of the new standard for
    our consolidated financial statements is the first quarter of
    fiscal 2007, which begins on May 1, 2006.

In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
    (“SAB”) No. 107, which provides guidance on the
    implementation of Statement SFAS No. 123R,

“Share-Based Payments

”
    (SFAS No. 123R) (see discussion below). In particular,
    SAB No. 107 provides key guidance related to valuation
    methods (including assumptions such as expected volatility and
    expected term), the accounting for income tax effects of
    share-based payment arrangements upon adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R, the modification of employee share
    options prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the
    classification of compensation expense, capitalization of
    compensation cost related to share-based payment arrangements,
    first-time adoption of SFAS No. 123R in an interim
    period, and disclosures in Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 123R-3,

Transition Election and Accounting for Tax
    Effects.

The guidance provides a simplified
    method to calculate the Additional Paid-In Capital (APIC) pool
    for beginning balance of excess tax benefits and the method of
    determining the subsequent impact on the pool of option awards
    that are outstanding and fully or partially vested upon the
    adoption of SFAS No. 123R beginning on May 1,
    2006. In addition, this FSP addresses that when the alternative
    APIC pool calculation is used, tax benefits related to certain
    employee awards should be included as a cash flow from financing
    activities and a cash outflow from operating activities within
    the statements of cash flows. The FSP allows companies up to one
    year from the later of the adoption date of
    SFAS No. 123R or November 10, 2005 to evaluate
    the available transition alternatives and make a one-time
    election. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the
    new method provided by this guidance.

SFAS No. 123R and its related guidance permits public
    companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods:
    modified prospective method or modified retrospective method. We
    plan to adopt SFAS No. 123R using the modified
    prospective method, in which compensation cost is recognized
    beginning with the effective date (a) based on the
    requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all share-based
    payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on
    the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards
    granted to employees prior to the effective date of
    SFAS No. 123R that remain unvested on the effective
    date. We will recognize in our results of operations the
    compensation cost for stock-based awards issued after
    April 30, 2006 on a straight-line basis over the requisite
    service period for the entire award. For stock-based awards
    issued prior to May 1, 2006, we amortized the related
    compensation costs using the graded-vesting method.

As permitted by SFAS No. 123, we currently account for
    share-based payments to employees using the APB 25
    intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no
    compensation cost for employee stock options as grant date value
    equals fair value. The adoption of the SFAS No. 123R
    fair value method will have a significant impact on our reported
    results of operations because the stock-based compensation
    expense will be charged directly against our reported earnings.
    The pre-tax balance of unearned stock-based compensation to be
    expensed in the period fiscal 2007 through 2010 related to
    share-based awards unvested as of April 30, 2006, as
    previously calculated under the disclosure-only requirements of
    SFAS No. 123, is approximately $241,000. If there are
    any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested
    securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase, or
    cancel any remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense.
    To the extent that we grant additional equity securities to
    employees or assume unvested securities in connection with any
    acquisitions, our stock-based compensation



NETWORK

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

expense will be increased by the additional unearned
    compensation resulting from those additional grants or
    acquisitions. We anticipate that we will grant additional
    employee stock options and restricted stock units in fiscal
    2007. The fair value of these grants cannot be predicted with
    certainty at this time due to the fact that the expense amount
    will depend on the timing of new grants, the number of new
    grants, changes in the market price or the volatility of our
    common stock. However, we currently estimate that the impact on
    our first fiscal quarter will be between
    $0.07 — $0.09 per share. As of May 1,
    2006, the contractual life of our stock options has been
    shortened to seven years from ten years for options issued on or
    after this date, and to the extent that the shorter life changes
    employees’ exercise behavior, it may change the expected
    term of an option going forward. We are not aware of any other
    changes in business practices and do not expect any violations
    of debt covenants due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

The unrealized losses on these investments were primarily due to
    interest rate fluctuations. We have the ability to hold these
    investments until recovery of their carrying values. We also
    believe that we will be able to collect all principal and
    interest amounts due to us at maturity given the high credit
    quality of these investments. Accordingly, we do not consider
    these investments to be

other-than-temporarily

impaired at April 30, 2006.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

From time to time, we have committed to purchase various key
    components used in the manufacture of our products. We establish
    accruals for estimated losses on purchased components for which
    we believe it is probable that they will not be utilized in
    future operations. To the extent that such forecasts are not
    achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may change.

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which may
    arise in the normal course of business. While the outcome of
    these legal matters is currently not determinable, we do not
    believe that any current litigation or claims will have a
    material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, operating
    results, or financial condition.

Line of
    Credit

In July 1998, we negotiated a $5,000 unsecured revolving credit
    facility with a domestic commercial bank. Under terms of the
    credit facility, which expires in December 2006, we must
    maintain various financial covenants, which we are in
    compliance. Any borrowings under this agreement bear interest at
    either LIBOR plus 1% or at the lender’s “prime”
    lending rate, such rate determined at our discretion. As of
    April 30, 2006, the amounts allocated under the credit
    facility to support certain of our outstanding letters of credit
    amounted to $1,471.

We also have foreign exchange facilities used for hedging
    arrangements with several banks that allow us to enter into
    foreign exchange contracts of up to $325,000, of which $56,146
    was available at April 30, 2006.

Debt

On March 31, 2006, Network Appliance Global LTD.,
    (“Global”), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into
    a loan agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), with the
    lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as
    administrative agent. The following is a summary of the material
    terms of the loan agreement.

Structure:

The Loan Agreement provides for
    term loans available in two tranches, a tranche of $220,000
    (“Tranche A”) and a tranche of $80,000
    (“Tranche B”), for an aggregate borrowing of
    $300,000. The full amount of



NETWORK
    APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the term loans was advanced at the closing. The proceeds of the
    term loans have been used to finance a dividend from Global to
    the Company under the American Job Creation Act (See
    Note 8).

Maturity, Amortization and Prepayment:

The
    Tranche A term loans are required to be paid upon the
    maturity of the investments securing the Tranche A term
    loans. The Tranche B term loans amortize over 8 quarters,
    commencing July 31, 2006. The Tranche A term loans and
    Tranche B term loans, together with accrued and unpaid
    interest, are due in full on the maturity date of March 31,
    2008. Loan repayments of $166,211 and $133,789 are due in fiscal
    2007 and in fiscal 2008, respectively. Global has the right to
    make prepayment on the loan without any premium or penalty by
    giving prior notice to the administrative agent.

Interest:

Interest on the Tranche A term
    loans accrues at a floating rate based on the base rate in
    effect from time to time, 5.125% at April 30, 2006, plus a
    margin of up to 0.125%. Interest on the Tranche B term
    loans accrues at a floating rate based on the base rate in
    effect from time to time plus a margin based on Global’s
    leverage ratio, ranging from 0.0% to 0.125%, or at Global’s
    election, at LIBOR plus a margin based on Global’s leverage
    ratio, ranging from 0.500% to 1.125%.

Interest on the term loans is payable quarterly in arrears with
    respect to base rate loans and at the end of an interest period
    in the case of LIBOR loans (or quarterly if the interest period
    is longer than three months).

Guarantees and Security:

The obligations of
    Global under the Loan Agreement are guaranteed by Global’s
    material subsidiaries, but not by the Company or any of its
    other direct subsidiaries. The Tranche A term loans are
    secured by certain investments totaling $241,152 held by Global
    and the Tranche B term loans are secured by a pledge of
    accounts receivable by Global’s subsidiary, Network
    Appliance B.V.

Covenants and Events of Default:

The Loan
    Agreement requires Global to comply with a liquidity ratio and,
    so long as any Tranche B term loans are outstanding, a
    leverage ratio. Additionally, the Loan Agreement contains
    affirmative covenants, including reporting requirements,
    covenants regarding conduct of business, payment of obligations,
    including taxes, maintenance of properties and insurance,
    inspection rights, compliance with applicable law and
    maintenance of collateral. Further, the Loan Agreement contains
    negative covenants limiting the ability of Global and its
    subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness, grant
    liens, sell assets, make certain acquisitions, enter into
    mergers, change their business, make investments, enter into
    swap agreements, pay dividends, enter into transactions with
    affiliates, enter into restrictive agreements and prepay or
    amend the terms of subordinated indebtedness. The events of
    default under the Loan Agreement include payment defaults,
    misrepresentations, breaches of covenants, cross defaults with
    certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy events, judgments,
    certain ERISA events and changes of control.

As of April 30, 2006, Global is in compliance with all debt
    covenants as required by the Loan Agreement.

Stockholders’
    Equity

Preferred Stock

— Our Board of Directors
    has the authority to issue up to 5,000 shares of preferred
    stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences,
    privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, of those
    shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders.

Stock Option Plans

— In September 1995, we
    adopted the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1995 Plan). All
    outstanding options issued under a previous option plan were
    incorporated into the 1995 Plan upon the effectiveness of our
    initial public offering.

Under the 1995 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant to
    employees, directors, and consultants options to purchase shares
    of our common stock. The 1995 Plan comprises three separate
    equity incentive programs: (i) the Discretionary Option
    Program under which options may be granted to eligible
    individuals at a fixed price per share; (ii) the Salary
    Investment Option Grant Program under which the company’s
    officers and other highly compensated employees may elect to
    have a portion of their base salary reduced in return for stock
    options and (iii) the Stock Issuance Program under which
    eligible persons may be issued shares of Common Stock directly.
    Options granted

    APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

under the 1995 Plan generally vest at a rate of 25% on the first
    anniversary of the vesting commencement date and then ratably
    over the following 36 months. Options expire as determined
    by the Board of Directors, but not more than 10 years after
    the date of grant.

In April 1997, the Board of Directors adopted the Special
    Nonofficer Stock Option Plan (the Nonofficer Plan) which
    provides for the grant of options and the issuance of common
    stock under terms substantially the same as those provided under
    the 1995 Plan, except that the Nonofficer Plan allows only for
    the issuance of nonqualified options to nonofficer employees.

In August 1999, the Board of Directors adopted the 1999 Stock
    Option Plan (the 1999 Plan), which comprises five separate
    equity incentive programs: (i) the Discretionary Option
    Grant Program under which options may be granted to eligible
    individuals during the service period at a fixed price per
    share, (ii) the Stock Appreciation Rights Program under
    which eligible persons may be granted stock appreciation rights
    that allow individuals to receive the appreciation in Fair
    Market Value of the shares, (iii) the Stock Issuance
    Program under which eligible individuals may be issued shares of
    Common Stock directly; (iv) the Performance Share and
    Performance Unit Program under which eligible persons may be
    granted performance shares and performance units which result in
    payment to the participant only if performance goals or other
    vesting criteria are achieved; and (v) the Automatic Option
    Grant Program under which nonemployee board members
    automatically receive option grants at designated intervals over
    their period of board service.

The 1999 Plan supplements the existing 1995 Plan and Nonofficer
    Plan, and those plans will continue to remain in full force and
    effect until all available shares have been issued under each
    such plan. However, an Automatic Option Grant Program previously
    in effect under the 1995 Plan terminated as of October 26,
    1999, and all automatic option grants made to nonemployee board
    members on or after that date will be made under the 1999 Plan.

Under the 1999 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant to
    employees, directors, and consultants and other independent
    advisors options to purchase shares of our common stock during
    their period of service with us. The exercise price for an
    incentive stock option and a nonstatutory option cannot be less
    than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the
    grant date. Options granted under the 1999 Plan generally vest
    over a four-year period. Options will have a term of
    10 years after the date of grant, subject to earlier
    termination upon the occurrence of certain events. In fiscal
    2003, the 1999 Plan was amended to increase the share reserve by
    an additional 14,000 shares of common stock and effect
    certain changes to the Automatic Option Grant Program in effect
    for the nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. In fiscal
    2004, the 1999 Plan was amended to create the Stock Issuance
    Program, whereby eligible individuals may be issued shares of
    common stock directly, either through the issuance or immediate
    purchase of these shares or as a bonus for services rendered. In
    fiscal 2005, the 1999 Plan was amended to increase the share
    reserve by an additional 10,200 shares of common stock; to
    create the Stock Appreciation Right Program under which eligible
    persons may be granted stock appreciation rights that allow
    individuals to receive the appreciation in Fair Market Value of
    the shares; to create the Performance Share and Performance Unit
    Program under which eligible persons may be granted performance
    shares and performance units that result in payment to the
    participant only if performance goals or other vesting criteria
    are achieved; and to prohibit the repricing of any outstanding
    stock option or stock appreciation right after it has been
    granted or to cancel any outstanding stock option or stock
    appreciation right and immediately replace it with a new stock
    option or stock appreciation right with a lower exercise price
    unless approved by stockholders. In fiscal 2006, the 1999 Plan
    was amended to increase the share reserve by an additional
    10,600 shares of common stock and limit the number of
    shares that may be issued pursuant to full value awards that may
    be granted under the Stock Issuance Program or the Performance
    Share and Performance Unit Program.

There have been no repricings to date under any of the plans and
    no stock appreciation rights have been issued. As of May 1,
    2006, the contractual life of our stock options has been
    shortened to seven years from ten years for options issued on or
    after this date.

In fiscal 2004, under terms of the Spinnaker merger agreement we
    acquired Spinnaker and assumed options and restricted stock
    units to purchase 1,721 shares of common stock in
    connection with the Spinnaker 2000 Stock Plan. The Spinnaker
    2000 Stock Plan has a total of 2,942 authorized shares.
    Outstanding options and restricted stock units were exchanged
    pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. The options and
    restricted stock units granted under this plan generally vest at
    a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting
    commencement date and then ratably over the following
    36 months. The options expire not more than 10 years
    from the date of grant.

In fiscal 2006, we assumed various stock option plans in
    connection with our Alacritus and Decru acquisitions. Pursuant
    to the provisions of the merger agreements, outstanding shares
    were exchanged under certain exchange ratios in effect at the
    time of each merger. Options granted under these plans generally
    vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting
    commencement date and then ratably over the following
    36 months. Options expire not more than 10 years after
    the date of grant.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

— Under the
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), employees are entitled to
    purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the fair market
    value at certain specified dates over a two-year period. In
    fiscal 2006 and 2005, the plan was amended to increase the share
    reserve by an additional 1,500 and 1,300 shares of common
    stock, respectively. Of the 17,400 shares authorized to be
    issued under this plan, 4,298 shares were available for
    issuance at April 30, 2006; 1,575, 1,598, and
    1,486 shares were issued in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004,
    respectively, at a weighted average price of $18.28, $13.30, and
    $10.62 respectively.

Stock Issuance Program

— Under the 1995
    Stock Issuance Program, certain eligible persons may be issued
    shares of common stock directly. During fiscal 2006 and 2005,
    210 and 10 shares, respectively, of restricted stock awards
    were issued to certain employees. The exercise price discount
    from fair market value of these shares has been recorded as
    deferred stock compensation expense, which is being amortized
    ratably over its respective vesting periods, between three to
    four years. At April 30, 2006, 288 shares were
    available for future issuances under this program.

Deferred Stock Compensation

— Deferred
    stock compensation is recorded for the grant of stock awards or
    shares of restricted stock to employees at exercise prices
    deemed to be less than the fair value of our common stock on the
    grant date. Deferred stock compensation is also recorded for
    retention escrow shares withheld in accordance with the merger
    agreement; see Note 12. Deferred stock compensation is
    adjusted to reflect cancellations and forfeitures due to
    employee terminations as they occur. We recorded $29,855,
    $1,401, and $28,617 of deferred stock compensation in fiscal
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, primarily related to unvested
    options assumed and retention escrow shares withheld in the
    Spinnaker acquisition, restricted stock awards to certain
    employees, and the grant of stock options below fair value to
    certain highly compensated employees. The fiscal 2004 deferred
    stock compensation was higher due to unvested options assumed
    and retention escrow shares withheld in the Spinnaker
    acquisition totaling $25,892. We reversed $2,886, $1,247 and
    $3,235 of deferred compensation in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively, due to employee terminations. The reversals were
    primarily related to the forfeiture of unvested options assumed
    in acquisitions as a result of employee terminations.

We recorded $60, $428, and $498 in compensation expense in
    fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, for the fair value of
    options granted to a member of the Board of Directors in
    recognition for services performed outside of the normal
    capacity of a board member. During fiscal 2002, 100 common
    shares under the 1995 Plan were granted at an exercise price of
    $15.32 per share, the fair market value per share on the
    grant date. The option has a term of 10 years measured from
    the grant date, subject to earlier termination following his
    cessation of board service, and will vest in a series of 48
    successive equal monthly installments upon his completion of
    each month of board service over the

48-month

period measured from the grant date.

We recorded $13,233, $7,720 and $3,397 in compensation expense
    for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, primarily related
    to the amortization of deferred stock compensation from unvested
    options assumed in the Decru, Alacritus, WebManage and Spinnaker
    acquisitions, the retention escrow shares relative to Spinnaker,
    the grant of stock options to certain highly compensated
    employees below fair value at the date of grant and the award of
    restricted stock to certain employees. Based on deferred stock
    compensation recorded at April 30, 2006, estimated future
    deferred stock compensation amortization, excluding the impact
    of SFAS No. 123R, for fiscal 2007, 2008, 2009, and
    2010 would be $20,340, $14,288, $8,068, and $6,571 respectively,
    and none thereafter.

Stock Repurchase Program

— Through
    April 30, 2006, the Board of Directors had authorized the
    repurchase of up to $650,000 in shares of our outstanding common
    stock. At April 30, 2006, $405,656 remained available for
    future repurchases. The stock repurchase program may be
    suspended or discontinued at any time.

During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 17,430 shares of our
    common stock at an aggregate cost of $488,908, or a weighted
    average price of $28.05 per share. During fiscal 2005, we
    repurchased 7,713 shares of our common stock at an
    aggregate cost of $192,903, or a weighted average price of
    $25.01 per share. The repurchases were recorded as treasury
    stock and resulted in a reduction of stockholders’ equity.

Current deferred tax assets are $48,496 and $37,584 as of fiscal

    for fiscal 2006 and 2005 are $26,164 and $54,252, respectively,
    and are included in other assets within the accompanying
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Jobs Act created a one-time incentive for
    U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned
    abroad by providing an 85% dividend-received deduction for
    certain dividends from certain

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company incurred a charge
    of approximately $22,482 for federal and state income taxes
    related to the repatriation of approximately $405,548 of
    accumulated income earned by its foreign subsidiaries. As a
    result of this dividend, there were no significant unremitted
    earnings held by our foreign subsidiaries at April 30, 2006.

During fiscal 2006, our Netherlands subsidiary received a
    favorable tax ruling from the Netherlands tax authorities
    effective May 1, 2005. This new ruling replaces a previous
    Netherlands tax ruling that was scheduled to expire on
    December 31, 2005. The new ruling results in both a lower
    level of earnings subject to tax in the Netherlands and an
    extension of the expiration date to April 30, 2010. During
    fiscal 2004, we recognized and reported a substantial tax
    benefit of $16,831 that related to the retroactive application
    of the original ruling.

As of April 30, 2006, our Netherlands subsidiary had a
    conditional royalty expense carryforward of $51,658 that may
    become available for offset against future Netherlands income.
    The carryforward may not, however, be used to offset income
    under the new Netherlands tax ruling expiring April 30,
    2010. The carryforward does not have an expiration date. We have
    established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset
    for the carryforward based upon our belief that we will not be
    able to utilize this attribute. In the event we are able to
    utilize this attribute,



NETWORK
    APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the tax benefit of the carryforward will be accounted for as a
    credit to stockholders’ equity of $7,605 and as a reduction
    to the income tax provision of $5,568.

We have been notified of examinations in the U.S. and several
    foreign tax jurisdictions. The rights to some of our
    intellectual property (“IP”) is owned by certain of
    our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made between U.S. and
    foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this IP.
    Recently, some other companies have had their foreign IP
    arrangements challenged as part of an examination.. Our
    management does not believe, based upon information currently
    known to us that the final resolution of any of our audits will
    have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial
    position and the results of operations and cash flows.

As of April 30, 2006, the federal and state net operating
    loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately
    $986,332 and $603,131, respectively. The federal net operating
    loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2021, and the
    state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in
    fiscal 2007. As of April 30, 2006, we had federal and state
    credit carryforwards of approximately $41,195 and $48,413,
    respectively, available to offset future income tax liabilities.
    The federal and state credit carryforwards will begin to expire
    in fiscal 2009.

During fiscal 2005, we established a valuation allowance against
    certain capital loss carryforwards of approximately $3,468 based
    upon our belief that we will not be able to utilize this
    attribute before expiration starting in fiscal 2008.

During fiscal 2004, as part of our acquisition of Spinnaker, we
    acquired approximately $52,000 and $12,000 of federal and state
    net operating losses, respectively, and $2,700 of federal tax
    credits that were realized as deferred tax assets upon
    acquisition. We also established a valuation reserve of $2,400
    against a portion of the state net operating loss carryforwards
    of Spinnaker which if utilized will be treated as a reduction of
    acquired goodwill.

During fiscal 2006, as part of our acquisition of Alacritus, we
    acquired approximately $6,100 of federal net operating losses
    and $50 of federal tax credits that were realized as deferred
    tax assets upon acquisitions.

During fiscal 2006, as part of our acquisition of Decru, we
    acquired approximately $32,100 of federal net operating losses
    and $1,100 of federal tax credits that were realized as deferred
    tax assets upon acquisition. We also established valuation
    reserves of $1,200 and $1,200 against all of Decru’s state
    net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credit
    carryforwards, respectively, that existed as of the acquisition
    date. If utilized, these attributes will be treated as a
    reduction of acquired goodwill.

We have provided a valuation allowance on certain of our
    deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards,
    conditional royalty carryforwards, and tax credit carryforwards
    attributable to the exercise of employee stock options because
    of uncertainty regarding their realization. The total valuation
    allowance for these items is approximately $423,329 and $357,501
    at the end of fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. If recognized,
    the tax benefit of these tax credits, losses and conditional
    royalty will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders’
    equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term
    investments, and restricted cash and investments reported in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate their carrying value.
    The fair value of short-term investments and foreign exchange
    contracts are carried at fair value based on quoted market
    prices. Other investments in equity securities are included in
    other assets at April 30, 2006 and 2005 with total carrying
    value of $11,020 and $1,837, which approximates their fair
    values. The fair value of our debt also approximates its carry
    value as of April 30, 2006.

We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative
    or trading purposes. We enter into forward foreign exchange and
    currency option contracts to hedge trade and intercompany
    receivables and payables as well as future sales and operating
    expenses against future movement in foreign exchange rates.

Foreign currency forward contracts obligate us to buy or sell
    foreign currencies at a specified future date. Option contracts
    give us the right to buy or sell foreign currencies and are
    exercised only when economically beneficial. As of
    April 30, 2006, we had $343,454 of outstanding foreign
    exchange contracts (including $17,214 of option contracts) in
    Australian Dollars, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Danish
    Krone, European Currency Units, Israeli New Shekel, South
    African Rand, Swedish Krona, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, and
    Norwegian Kroner that all had remaining maturities of five
    months or less. As of April 30, 2005, we had $211,019 of
    outstanding foreign exchange contracts (including $11,877 of
    option contracts) in Australian Dollars, British Pounds,
    Canadian Dollars, Danish Krone, European Currency Units, Israeli
    New Shekel, South African Rand, Swedish Krona, and Swiss Francs,
    that all had remaining maturities of four months or less. For
    the balance sheet hedges, these contracts are adjusted to fair
    value at the end of each month and are included in earnings. The
    premiums paid on the foreign currency option contracts are
    recognized as a reduction to other income when the contract is
    entered into. For cash flow hedges, the related gains or losses
    are included in other comprehensive income. Gains and losses on
    these foreign exchange contracts are offset by losses and gains
    on the underlying assets and liabilities. At April 30, 2006
    and 2005, the estimated notional fair values of forward foreign
    exchange contracts were $345,067 and $211,064, respectively. The
    fair value of foreign exchange contracts is based on prevailing
    financial market information.

Business
    Combinations

Acquisition
    of Decru

On August 26, 2005, we completed our acquisition of Decru,
    Inc. (“Decru”), a Delaware corporation that develops
    and sells encryption software and appliances which encrypt
    network data. The acquisition resulted in the issuance of
    approximately 8,270 shares of our common stock with a fair
    value of approximately $191,874, approximately 1,907 stock
    options and restricted stock with a fair value of approximately
    $36,142 and the payment of approximately $54,482 in cash (of
    which approximately $34,049 has been placed in escrow to secure
    the Decru stockholders’ indemnification obligations to us
    pursuant to the Merger Agreement), and $711 acquisition-related
    transaction costs, for a total purchase price of approximately
    $283,209. The common stock issued in the acquisition was valued
    at $23.20 per share using a measurement date of
    August 11, 2005 in accordance with EITF 99-12,

Determination of the Measurement Date for the Market Price of
    Acquirer Securities Issued in a Purchase Business
    Combinations.

The options were valued using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following inputs:
    volatility factor of 69%, expected life of 3.8 years, and
    risk-free interest rate of 2.9%. The historical operations of
    Decru were not significant. A summary of the total purchase
    price is as follows based on independent appraisal and

In accordance with SFAS 141, we have allocated the purchase
    price to the estimated tangible and intangible assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed, including in-process research and
    development, based on their estimated fair values. Goodwill of
    $192,894 was generated in connection with our acquisition of
    Decru. Decru, a provider in storage security products, offering
    data protection solutions for enterprises and governments,
    including regulatory compliance, privacy, secure consolidation,
    and outsourcing. The current and future potential for this
    technology will enable us to help our customers manage their
    risk of data theft and corruption with data encryption and
    authentication products. In addition, Decru has an experienced
    and knowledgeable workforce and an existing infrastructure.
    These opportunities, along with the ability to leverage the
    Decru workforce, were significant contributing factors to the
    establishment of the purchase price, resulting in the
    recognition of a significant amount of goodwill. The fair values
    assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed are based on management estimates and
    assumptions, and other information compiled by management,
    including third-party valuations that utilized established
    valuation techniques appropriate for the high-technology
    industry. Goodwill recorded as a result of this acquisition is
    not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. In accordance
    with SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS 142”), goodwill is not amortized but will
    be reviewed at least annually for impairment. Purchased
    intangibles with finite lives will be amortized over their

    intangible assets. We are amortizing these intangible assets
    over 2-6 years on a straight-line basis.

In-process
    Research and Development (“IPR&D”)

Of the total purchase price, $5,000 has been allocated to
    in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) and
    was expensed in fiscal 2006. Projects that qualify as IPR&D
    represent those that have not yet reached technological
    feasibility and which have no alternative future use.
    Technological feasibility is established when an enterprise has
    completed all planning, designing, coding, and testing
    activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be
    produced to meet its design specifications including functions,
    features, and technical performance requirement. The value of
    IPR&D was determined by estimating the stage of completion
    and risk associated with IPR&D to determine the level of
    discount rate to be applied, estimating costs to develop the
    purchased IPR&D into commercially viable products,
    estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when
    completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present
    value based on the percentage of completion of the IPR&D
    projects.

Deferred
    Stock Compensation

In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 44,
    “

Accounting for Certain Transactions involving Stock
    Compensation”

, we recorded the intrinsic value,
    measured as the difference between the grant price and fair
    market value on the acquisition consummation date, of unvested
    options and restricted stock units assumed in the Decru
    acquisition as deferred stock compensation. Such deferred stock
    compensation which aggregated $18,549 for Decru, are recorded as
    a separate component of stockholders’ equity in the
    accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be amortized
    over the vesting term of the related options. In connection with
    the Decru merger, we assumed all options to purchase Decru
    common stock granted under the Decru, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive
    Plan that were outstanding at the closing of the Merger, which
    options shall be exercisable for an aggregate of
    1,907 shares of our Common Stock at an average price of
    $11.86 per share.

Acquisition
    of Alacritus

On May 2, 2005, we acquired Alacritus, Inc., a privately
    held company based in Pleasanton, California, that develops and
    sells disk-based virtual tape library software for data
    protection solutions. Under terms of the agreement, we paid
    Alacritus $11,000 in cash and assumed options to acquire
    79 shares of common stock at an average price of
    $26.37 per share and 43 shares of restricted stock
    units at $0 per share. We also incurred certain transaction
    costs and assumed certain operating assets and liabilities. The
    historical operations of Alacritus were not significant.

Acquisition
    of Spinnaker

On February 18, 2004, we acquired Spinnaker for
    approximately $305,597 (including transaction costs of $2,985)
    in an all-stock transaction, through the merger of Nagano Sub,
    Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Network Appliance, with and
    into Spinnaker (the Merger). The purchase price of the
    transaction was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities
    based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the
    acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets, with the
    remaining amount being classified as goodwill. Goodwill of
    $240,106 was generated in connection with our acquisition of
    Spinnaker. Spinnaker was a pioneer in scalable system
    architectures, distributed file systems, next-generation
    clustering technologies, and virtualization. The current and
    future potential for this technology will improve our products
    in scalability, simplicity, and total cost of ownership for
    enterprise storage systems. In addition, at the time of its
    acquisition, Spinnaker had an experienced and knowledgeable
    workforce and an existing infrastructure.

Restructuring
    Charges

In fiscal 2002, as a result of continuing unfavorable economic
    conditions and a reduction in IT spending rates, we implemented
    two restructuring plans, which included reductions in workforce
    and consolidations of facilities. As of April 30, 2006, we
    have no outstanding balance in our restructuring liability for
    the first restructuring. The second restructuring related to the
    closure of an engineering facility and consolidation of
    resources to the Sunnyvale headquarters. In the second quarter
    of fiscal 2006, we implemented a third restructuring plan
    related to the move of our global services center operations
    from Sunnyvale to our new flagship support center at our
    Research Triangle Park facility in North Carolina.

During fiscal 2006, we recorded a reduction in restructuring
    reserve of $1,256 resulting from the execution of new sublease
    agreement for our Tewksbury facility. Our restructuring
    estimates are reviewed and revised periodically and may result
    in a substantial charge or reduction to restructuring expense
    should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in
    previous management estimates. Such estimates included various
    assumptions such as the time period over which the facilities
    will be vacant, expected sublease terms, and expected sublease
    rates. In addition, we also recorded a restructuring charge of
    $1,140 in fiscal 2006 primarily attributed to severance-related
    amounts and relocation expenses related to the move of our
    global services center operations.

The following analysis sets forth the significant components of

Goodwill
    and Purchased Intangible Assets

We adopted SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets”

effective May 1, 2002. We
    recorded goodwill and assembled workforce of $48,212 relating to
    Orca and WebManage acquisitions. Under SFAS No. 142,
    goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units is required
    to be tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each
    reporting unit with its carrying value. Our reporting units are
    the same as our operating units. On an ongoing basis, goodwill
    is reviewed annually for impairment (or more frequently if
    indicators of impairment arise). As of April 30, 2006 and
    2005, respectively, there had been no impairment of goodwill and
    intangible assets.

During fiscal 2004, we acquired Spinnaker and recorded goodwill
    of $240,106 resulting from the allocation of the purchase price.
    During fiscal 2006, we acquired Alacritus and Decru and recorded
    goodwill of $6,323, and $192,894, respectively, resulting from
    the allocation of the purchase price. During fiscal 2006, we
    adjusted goodwill

As of April 30, 2006 and 2005, our acquired patents were

    accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. These patents are
    intended to enhance our technology base to build next-generation
    network-attached storage, storage area network, and
    fabric-attached storage systems for the benefit of our
    enterprise customers. The costs of such patents for use in
    research and development activities that have alternative future
    uses have been capitalized and amortized as intangible assets in
    accordance with SFAS No. 141. Capitalized patents are
    amortized over an estimated useful life of five years as
    research and development expenses.

Existing technology is amortized as cost of product revenue.
    Trademarks and tradenames are amortized over an estimated useful
    life of three years in sales and marketing expenses. Customer
    contracts and relationships are amortized over an estimated
    useful life of 18 months in sales and marketing expenses.

Guarantees

As of April 30, 2006, our financial guarantees consisted of
    standby letters of credit outstanding, bank guarantee, and
    restricted cash and investments which were related to loan
    collateral, facility lease requirements, service performance
    guarantees, customs and duties guarantees, VAT requirements, and
    workers’ compensation plans. The maximum amount of
    potential future payments under these arrangements was $248,719
    as of April 30, 2006, of which $246,910 was collateralized
    as restricted cash and investments on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets, and $1,809 were amounts outstanding under our commercial
    commitments (see Note 4). The maximum amount of potential
    future payments under these arrangements was $5,881 as of
    April 30, 2005, of which, $4,060 was collateralized as
    restricted cash and investment on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets, and $1,821 were amounts outstanding under our commercial
    commitments.

As of April 30, 2006, our notional fair values of foreign
    exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled
    $345,067. We do not believe that these derivatives present
    significant credit risks, because the counterparties to the
    derivatives consist of major financial institutions, and we
    manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any
    one counterparty. We do not enter into derivative financial
    instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Other than the
    risk associated with the financial condition of the
    counterparties, our maximum exposure related to foreign currency
    forward and option contracts is limited to the premiums paid.

We have both recourse and nonrecourse lease financing
    arrangements with third-party leasing companies through
    pre-existing relationships with the customers. We sell our
    products directly to the leasing company, and the lease
    arrangement is made between our customer and the leasing
    company. Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally
    three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid
    remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing company in
    the event that any customers default. For these recourse
    arrangements, revenue on the sale of our product to the leasing
    company are deferred and recognized into income as payments to
    the leasing company come due. As of April 30, 2006 and
    2005, the maximum recourse exposure under such leases totaled
    approximately $8,443 and $7,047, respectively. Under the terms
    of the nonrecourse leases we do not have any continuing
    obligations or liabilities. To date, we have not experienced
    significant losses under this lease financing program.

We do not maintain a general warranty reserve for estimated
    costs of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized
    due to our extensive product quality program and processes and
    because our global customer service inventories utilized to
    correct product failures are expensed when issued to field
    support.

We enter into standard indemnification agreements in the
    ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, we
    agree to defend and indemnify the other
    party — primarily our customers or business
    partners or subcontractors — for damages and
    reasonable costs incurred in any suit or claim brought against
    them alleging that our products sold to them infringe any
    U.S. patent, copyright, trade secret, or similar right. If
    a product becomes the subject of an infringement claim, we may,
    at our option: (i) replace the product with another
    noninfringing product that provides substantially similar
    performance; (ii) modify the infringing product so that it
    no longer infringes but



NETWORK
    APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

remains functionally equivalent; (iii) obtain the right for
    the customer to continue using the product at our expense and
    for the reseller to continue selling the product; (iv) take
    back the infringing product and refund to customer the purchase
    price paid less depreciation amortized on a straight line basis.
    We have not been required to make material payments pursuant to
    these provisions historically. We have not identified any losses
    that are probable under these provisions and, accordingly, we
    have not recorded a liability related to these indemnification
    provisions.

We have not recorded any liability at April 30, 2006 and
    2005, respectively, related to these guarantees since the
    maximum amount of potential future payments under such
    guarantees, indemnities and warranties is not determinable,
    other than as described above.

Subsequent
    Events

On June 22, 2006, the Company entered into an asset
    purchase agreement with Blue Coat Systems, Inc. (“Blue
    Coat”). In connection with the transaction, the Company has
    agreed to sell to Blue Coat certain assets related to its
    NetCache business in exchange for consideration to consist of
    $23,914 in cash and 360 shares of Blue Coat common stock.
    Concurrently with the execution of the asset purchase agreement,
    Blue Coat sold and issued to entities affiliated with Sequoia
    Capital preferred stock in an aggregate amount of $42,060
    pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D under the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company and Daniel
    Warmenhoven, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and a
    member of the Company’s Board of Directors, and Nicholas
    Moore, a member of the Company’s Board of Directors, are
    limited partners in one of the Sequoia Capital funds that
    participated in Blue Coat’s sale of preferred stock, and
    each has an interest in the participating Sequoia Capital fund
    that is less than 5%. In addition, Donald Valentine, the
    Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, is a general
    partner of Sequoia Capital. Independent directors of the
    Company’s audit committee and investment committee approved
    the asset sale transaction, and Messrs Valentine, Warmenhoven
    and Moore recused themselves from such vote.

The Company will continue to provide existing customers support
    for its NetCache appliances for the duration of their support
    contracts, and will honor existing NetCache customer
    commitments. The Company considers the transaction to be
    immaterial to expectations for its business going forward.
    Revenue from NetCache accounted for 3.2% of total consolidated
    revenue in fiscal 2006. The asset purchase is subject to several
    customary conditions.

Controls
    and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls are procedures designed to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under
    the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure Controls are also
    designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and
    communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the
    end of the period covered by this report (the “Evaluation
    Date”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the
    Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective such that the information relating to Network
    Appliance, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to
    be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) reports (i) is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
    rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated
    to Network Appliance’s management, including our principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its
    inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
    may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
    any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
    the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
    in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that,
    as of April 30, 2006, our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of April 30,
    2006 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an
    independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
    their report which is included herein.

(c)

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with
    management’s evaluation during our last fiscal quarter that
    have materially effected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    effect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Network Appliance, Inc.:

Sunnyvale, California

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting, that Network Appliance, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of April 30,
    2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on management’s assessment, and an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
    being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
    and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
    assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of April 30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of April 30, 2006, based on the criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial
    statement schedule as of and for the year ended April 30,
    2006 of the Company and our report dated July 11, 2006
    expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements
    and the financial statement schedule.
