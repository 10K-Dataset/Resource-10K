Item 1.

Business

Overview

Network Appliance, Inc., is a worldwide leader in
enterprise network storage and data management solutions.
NetApp® network storage solutions and service offerings
provide data-intensive enterprises with consolidated storage,
improved data center operations, economical business
continuance, and efficient remote data access across the
distributed enterprise. Network Appliance’s success to date
has been in delivering highly cost-effective network storage
solutions that reduce the complexity associated with
conventional storage solutions. We believe our products have set
the standard for simplicity and ease of operation, with what we
believe to be one of the lowest total costs of ownership
(TCO) and highest returns on investment (ROI) in the
industry. Network Appliance

TM

solutions are the data
management and storage foundation for leading enterprises,
government agencies, and universities worldwide.

Network Appliance was founded in 1992 with the
goal of simplifying data access by creating the world’s
first network storage appliance. The first system was shipped in
1993. Today Network Appliance is a multinational corporation
with over 2,200 employees and an installed base of products in
over 90 countries.

Network Appliance focuses on simplifying the
complex. This philosophy drives the entire company, from product
design and system operation through support processes. Our drive
for simplicity has delivered significant customer advantages:

•

Lower total cost of ownership, in part because
    system administrators can more efficiently manage much greater
    amounts of information, and also because recovery times are
    significantly reduced in the event of a disaster or data
    corruption.

•

Business agility, improving our customers’
    ability to react quickly to changes via rapid deployment or
    reconfiguration of storage assets.



•

Improved information availability, because
    simplicity drives reliability.

•

Improved application performance, enabling
    customers to advance their time-to-market goals.

Customer Challenges

Network Appliance enterprise network storage
solutions directly address the major information technology
challenges that enterprises face — consolidating
rapidly growing quantities of storage, reducing costs associated
with data center operations, ensuring business continuance, and
managing data throughout the globally distributed enterprise.

To solve these customer challenges, Network
Appliance strives to simplify whenever possible, utilizing open
standards and driving industry collaboration, partnering with
other industry leaders, and providing world-class global service
and support.

•

Simplicity.

NetApp’s appliance architecture
    allows enterprises to reduce management overhead, decrease
    deployment times, and eliminate downtime typically associated
    with general-purpose architectures. Network Appliance plans to
    continue to expand on the appliance architecture in future
    product designs and service offerings.

•

Open standards and industry collaboration.

Network Appliance participates in and
    leads many industry initiatives and organizations, such as the
    Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA), that have
    defined standards that are widely deployed today. Standards that
    Network Appliance has helped advance include the Network File
    System (NFS) protocol for file access in UNIX® and
    Linux® environments, the Common Internet File System
    (CIFS) protocol for file access in Windows®
    environments, the Internet Content Adaptation Protocol
    (ICAP) for content adaptation in Web environments, the
    Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) for simplifying
    backup of networked storage, and the Direct Access File System
    (DAFS) protocol for high-performance, high-throughput
    access to data. We plan to continue to participate in driving
    emerging standards, including



NFS version 4, 10 Gigabit Ethernet, and the
    Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) protocol for
    building block-based storage area networks using widely deployed
    Ethernet infrastructures.

•

Business application integration and
    partnerships.

Network Appliance’s
    goal is to deliver complete network storage solutions to
    customers. Our partners are vital to our success in this area,
    and we have strengthened our partner relationships with database
    and business application companies including EDS/ PLM Solutions,
    Dassault Catia, Documentum, several units within IBM including
    DB2 and Lotus, Interwoven, Landmark Graphics, Microsoft,
    Openwave, Oracle, Rational, SAP, Sybase, Vignette, and others.
    These application partnerships enhance our ability to reduce
    implementation time, increase application availability, and
    provide the highest level of solution support to customers.
    Technology and infrastructure solution partners enable seamless
    integration into customers’ existing environments,
    resulting in lower costs and more rapid deployment. Our
    infrastructure partner list includes ADIC, Brocade, Cisco,
    Computer Associates, Legato, QuantumyATL, Spectra Logic,
    StorageTek, and Veritas.

•

Global service and support.

Network Appliance’s increasing
    number of enterprise customers requires a global, integrated
    service and support model. These requirements have been met by
    expanding efforts in professional services and support
    offerings, as well as by continuing to develop strategic
    partnerships. Our partnerships with service providers such as
    Accenture, Computer Sciences Corporation, IBM Global Services,
    and PwC allow us to better serve customers by broadening service
    offerings, as well as leveraging existing service and support
    relationships that customers may already have in place.

Target Verticals

We are focused on expanding our presence in
highly targeted vertical markets. Examples include:



•

Life sciences.

Pharmaceutical, bioresearch, genomic
    research, and care providers are focused on developing vital new
    drugs, improving quality of patient care, and increasing their
    returns on investment. Network Appliance solutions enable fast
    access, integration and sharing of massive amounts of
    exponentially growing scientific and medical imaging data,
    reducing time-to-market, and improving operational efficiency.

•

Global manufacturing companies face
    intense competitive pressure to develop attractive new products,
    improve time-to-market, and optimize profitability. Network
    Appliance solutions enable these companies to simplify the
    management overhead associated with storing and protecting huge
    amounts of ERP, engineering, and manufacturing product data,
    while ensuring that information can be easily and efficiently
    distributed to manufacturing and distribution sites around the
    world.

•

Telecommunications.

Service providers in the
    telecommunications industry are faced with deregulation,
    globalization, increased competition, and often a substantial
    debt burden. As a result, they must control infrastructure costs
    to serve existing customers and grow by identifying and
    developing compelling new revenue streams. NetApp products and
    solutions allow them to quickly and cost-effectively build the
    network storage infrastructure and content delivery networks
    required by the global telecommunications industry.

System Products

NetApp products consist of filer storage
appliances, NearStore

TM

appliances, NetCache®
content delivery appliances, data management and content
delivery software, and support services. Our configured
appliances range in price from $4,000 to more than $1,000,000.

All NetApp systems come packaged in
rack-mountable enclosures that can be installed in a
customer’s existing server racks or factory-installed and
configured in cabinets. Our appliances are based primarily on
commodity hardware, including Intel® Pentium®
processors, an advanced implementation of the industry-standard
PCI bus architecture, standard Ethernet adapters, and either
Fibre Channel-Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL), Advanced Technology
Attachment (ATA), or Small Computer System Interface
(SCSI) disk interconnects.

Filers

NetApp filers are a scalable suite of highly
available, field-proven networked storage systems for
consolidating data storage and simplifying data management. The
filer appliances are easy to install, configure, and manage.
They are specifically designed for highly scalable,
network-centric IT system architectures. Our filers are designed
for and deliver lower total cost of ownership than alternative
competitive systems. Heterogeneous data sharing provides
simultaneous file system access to UNIX, Linux, Windows, and
Web-based servers and clients.

Current filer products include:

•

NetApp F880 filer.

Introduced during fiscal year 2002 and
    built for the most demanding customers, the F880 is our
    highest-performance filer. The superior throughput and response
    times allow NetApp F880 filers to support thousands of users
    with up to 9 terabytes (TB) of raw data. The increased
    processing power of the NetApp F880 provides maximized
    scalability and performance for high-end enterprise
    applications. An integrated CompactFlash

TM

boot
    device simplifies management in remote or multifiler
    environments.

•

NetApp F840 filer.

The balance of capacity and
    performance with flexible I/ O configuration enables the NetApp
    F840 to power a broad range of large-scale applications. The
    F840 is currently deployed in large service provider networks
    and data-intensive enterprise environments including database,
    ERP, and design applications.



•

NetApp F810 and F820 filers.

Introduced during fiscal year 2002,
    these are entry-level, enterprise-class performance filers.
    NetApp F810 and F820 filers suit small- to medium-sized
    enterprise applications. These products enable the consolidation
    of heterogeneous data for enterprises and service providers.

•

NetApp F880c, F840c, F820c, and F810c filers.

For maximized data availability in
    mission-critical environments, NetApp F880c, F840c, F820c, and
    F810c clustered filers meet the networked storage challenges for
    large enterprises and applications that require high
    availability. NetApp clustered filers scale to support up to
    18TB of raw data. The architecture integrates multiple
    processors in an active/ active Clustered Failover configuration
    to provide high availability and scalable performance to
    multiple networks.

•

NetApp F87 filer.

Introduced during fiscal year 2002,
    the NetApp F87 filer is targeted at workgroup and remote branch
    office environments. The F87 filers leverage high-volume
    components to bring industry-leading NetApp features and
    functionality to entry-level applications, supporting access for
    up to 576 gigabytes (GB) of raw storage for user and
    application data.

NearStore

NetApp NearStore products, introduced during
fiscal year 2002, are designed for improving data backup and
recovery architectures and archiving infrequently accessed
files. NearStore appliances back up and restore data with speed,
consistency, and scalability unmatched in tape-based backup/
restore solutions. The product complements and significantly
improves existing tape backup processes by inserting economical
and simple-to-use disk-based storage between application storage
and tape libraries, resulting in a highly efficient two-stage
backup configuration. Unlike alternative technologies, recovery
time is measured in seconds and minutes, not hours and days.
Almost any type of primary storage can be backed up to NearStore
appliances, including UNIX, Linux, or Windows servers with
direct-attached or SAN-attached storage, desktop and notebook
computers, and NetApp filers. NearStore can also be used as a
mirror target within a data center or for mirroring data from
distributed offices or branches to a central location.

NearStore appliances are also ideal for
consolidating nearline data resources including reference and
archive data into a single storage platform. This platform can
be located and managed centrally, reducing costs associated with
data center operations.

Existing applications, such as document
management, have traditionally relied on Hierarchical Storage
Management (HSM) solutions for infrequently accessed data.
Providers of these applications are now integrating nearline
storage into their blueprint solution portfolio to enable faster
access to data and lower their operational costs to customers.
Emerging changes in traditional applications, such as data
warehousing, are now occurring for the purpose of separating
active and inactive database data between primary and secondary
storage. The ability for an organization to have an identical
management framework for both their primary and secondary
storage is a unique NetApp advantage.

The NearStore R100 is available in configurations
ranging from capacities of 12TB to 96TB, and can be configured
and managed to create virtually unlimited capacity.

NetCache

The NetCache product line is a scalable suite of
appliances, designed to solve complex Web content delivery
problems faced by enterprises and service providers. NetCache
appliances currently power some of the world’s largest
enterprises and telecommunications networks. These appliances
are deployed across the entire network, from the primary data
center to remote points of presence (POPs) and local offices
worldwide. They reduce network latency to enhance the overall
Web experience for intranet users, e-commerce customers, and
external suppliers and partners. NetCache appliances reliably
deliver high-quality audio and video streams, enabling a host of
next-generation network services and applications such as online
training, executive broadcasts, and large-scale corporate and
consumer video-on-demand services. NetCache appli-



ances also enable the delivery of value-added
services such as load balancing and virus scanning at the edge
of the network.

Current NetCache products include:

•

NetCache C6100.

The
    high-end NetCache C6100 delivers high levels of performance and
    reliability for the data center and other high-bandwidth
    locations. Large content libraries — up to 2TB of
    storage — can be reliably stored and optimally
    accessed. Enterprises and service providers use the NetCache
    C6100 to improve end-user response times, manage quality of
    service, reduce bandwidth costs, and provide security and
    content filtering controls.

•

NetCache C3100.

The
    midrange NetCache C3100 optimizes price/performance by
    supporting a wide range of capacity and reliability features.
    Reliability and availability of mission-critical data are
    ensured with features such as RAID data protection, redundant
    hardware, and hot-swap drives. These capabilities make the
    NetCache C3100 an attractive solution for environments
    experiencing rapid growth.

•

NetCache C1100.

Globally distributed enterprises,
    small/ medium-sized businesses, and service provider remote
    points of presence select the entry-level NetCache C1100 for its
    attractive price point and space-sensitive design. The
    affordable, fast access to data and content filtering
    capabilities increase productivity and improve overall user
    satisfaction. The appliance architecture is especially
    attractive in these environments where there is often limited
    local technical expertise.

Software Products

All NetApp appliances are configured with the
Data ONTAP

TM

microkernel, which includes the patented
Write Anywhere File Layout (WAFL®) file system. We
introduced Data ONTAP 6.2 during fiscal 2002 and included
support for the new Direct Access File System
(DAFS) protocol, several new data management software
products, and improvements to every major feature. Data ONTAP
software offers a unique set of features to ensure
mission-critical availability levels, while lowering the total
cost of ownership and the complexity typically associated with
enterprise storage management. Software features and products
include:



Customers may purchase an annual software
subscription upgrade that provides online access to all software
and firmware upgrades and updates.



Customer Service and Support

The Network Appliance customer service and
support organization provides a range of technical support
services, professional consulting services, and training. We
believe that providing high levels of customer service and
technical support are critical to customer satisfaction and to
our success.

Network Appliance’s commitment to customer
service and satisfaction is reflected in our Global Support
Center (GSC) operations available from four locations:
Sunnyvale, California; Raleigh, North Carolina; Hoofddorp,
Netherlands; and Singapore. Our “follow the sun”
strategy provides around-the-clock support regardless of where
the customer is located. All four Global Support Centers have
received the Support Center Practices (SCP) certification, which
is an internationally recognized standard created by the Service
& Support Professionals Association (SSPA) and a
consortium of IT companies to create a recognized quality
certification for support centers.

Warranty coverage for hardware is
product-specific, for a term of either one year or three years,
depending upon the product. Software warranty is for
90 days. The 90-day period warrants that media will be free
of defects and will perform substantially as described in the
end-user documentation. Warranty coverage includes access to the
NetApp on the Web (NOW)

TM

Web site and knowledge
system, AutoSupport, next-business-day exchange of system
components, 7x24 emergency phone support, and 7x24 Web case
support for nonemergency situations.

A customer can also purchase an extended warranty
after the initial warranty coverage expires. Purchasing the
extended warranty entitles the customer to access the services
included in the base warranty for an additional period of time,
and is typically renewed on an annual basis.

Customers can also select from a comprehensive
menu of service options to design a service program that
complements their existing in-house capabilities. Customers can
supplement their warranty or extended warranty packages by
choosing from the following service options:

•

Two- or four-hour hardware
    delivery.

programs. Certified, experienced Network Appliance trainers
teach the instructor-led programs around the world. All courses
include practical lessons and feature extensive hands-on
experience in installing, configuring, and troubleshooting
NetApp systems.

Sales and Marketing

Network Appliance markets and distributes
products globally in over 90 countries. In North America,
we employ a multichannel distribution strategy, which focuses on
product sales to end users through a direct sales force, as well
as selected value-added resellers. In Europe, we employ a mix of
resellers and direct sales channels to sell to end users. In
Asia, our products are primarily sold through resellers, which
are supported by channel sales representatives and technical
support personnel. No single customer accounted for 10% or more
of net sales in fiscal 2002, 2001, or 2000.

During fiscal year 2002, we launched Network
Appliance Canada Ltd., and Network Appliance Federal Systems,
Inc., to increase our sales presence.

Backlog

Network Appliance manufactures products based on
a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of
our customer demands. Orders are generally placed by customers
on an as-needed basis. Products are typically shipped within one
to four weeks following receipt of an order. In certain
circumstances, customers may cancel or reschedule orders without
penalty. For these reasons, “orders” may not
constitute a firm backlog, and may not be a meaningful indicator
of revenues.

Manufacturing

Manufacturing operations, primarily located in
Sunnyvale, California, include materials procurement, commodity
management, component engineering, test engineering,
manufacturing engineering, product assembly, product assurance,
quality control, and final test. We rely on many suppliers for
materials, as well as several key subcontractors for the
production of certain subassemblies and finished systems. Our
strategy has been to develop close relationships with our
suppliers, exchanging critical information and implementing
joint quality-training programs. During fiscal year 2002, we
expanded the use of subcontractors for the production of major
subassemblies, primarily to reduce our lead times for shipments
to Europe and to improve our manufacturing redundancy. See
“Risk Factors — We rely on a limited number of
suppliers” and “Risk Factors — The loss of
our sole contract manufacturer.” This manufacturing
strategy minimizes capital



investment and overhead expenditures and creates
flexibility for rapid expansion. We were awarded the
ISO 9001 certification on May 29, 1997, and continue
to be ISO-certified.

Research and Development

During fiscal year 2002, Network Appliance
launched more products than in any other year in the history of
the company. We introduced a number of new systems, including
the F87 and F810 low-end systems, the F880 and F880c high-end
systems, and the NearStore R100, which defined a new
category of storage solution. We enhanced almost every software
product in our portfolio and launched new products that
significantly improve data management capabilities, provide new
solutions in the areas of backup and recovery, and enable new
business continuance functionality. We introduced new products
to better integrate our filers into Microsoft Exchange,
Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle database environments.

See “Risk Factors — If we are
unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to
technological change, or if our new products do not achieve
market acceptance, our operating results could be materially
adversely affected.”

Competition

The storage and content delivery markets are
intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing
technology.

In the storage market, our filer appliances and
data management software compete primarily against storage
products and data management software from EMC Corporation,
Hitachi Data Systems, Hewlett-Packard Company (including the
integrated Compaq Computer Corporation), IBM Corporation, and
Sun Microsystems, Inc. We have also historically encountered
less-frequent competition from companies including Auspex
Systems, Inc., Dell, LSI Logic Corp., MTI Corp., and Procom
Technology.

In the content delivery market, our NetCache
appliances and content delivery software compete against caching
appliance and content delivery software vendors including Akamai
Technologies, Inc., CacheFlow, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., and
Inktomi Corp.

Additionally a number of new, privately held
companies are currently attempting to enter the storage and
content delivery markets, some of which may become significant
competitors in the future.

We believe that the principal competitive factors
affecting the storage and content delivery markets include
product benefits such as response time, reliability, data
availability, scalability, ease of use, price, multiprotocol
capabilities, and customer service and support.

See “Risk Factors — An increase in
competition could materially adversely affect our operating
results” and “If we are unable to develop and
introduce new products and respond to technological change, or
if our new products do not achieve market acceptance.”

Proprietary Rights

We currently rely on a combination of copyright
and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures,
contractual provisions and patents to protect our proprietary
rights. We seek to protect our software, documentation, and
other written materials under trade secret, copyright, and
patent laws, which afford only limited protection. We have
registered our Network Appliance name and logo, FAServer®,
FilerView, NetApp, NetCache, SecureShare® SnapManager,
SnapMirror, SnapRestore and WAFL® trademarks in the United
States. Other United States trademarks and some of the other
United States registered trademarks are registered
internationally as well. We will continue to evaluate the
registration of additional trademarks as appropriate. We
generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our
employees, resellers, and customers. We currently have multiple
United States and international patent applications pending and
multiple United States patents issued. See
— “Risk Factors — If we are unable to
protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased
competition that could materially adversely affect our operating
results.”

Employees

As of April 26, 2002, we had
2,280 employees. Of the total, 1,224 were in sales and
marketing, 514 in research and development, 246 in
finance and administration, and 296 in manufacturing and
customer service



operations. Our future performance depends in
significant part on our key technical and senior management
personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment agreement. We
have never had a work stoppage and consider relations with our
employees to be good.

Risk Factors

The following risk factors and other
information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties
described below are not the only ones we face.
Additional



risks and uncertainties not presently known to
us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair
our business operations. If any of the following risks actually
occur, our business, operating results, and financial condition
could be materially adversely affected.

Factors beyond our control could cause our
quarterly results to fluctuate.

We believe that period-to-period comparisons of
our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and
should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance.
Many of the factors that could cause our quarterly operating
results to fluctuate significantly in the future are beyond our
control and include the following:

In addition, sales for any future quarter may
vary and accordingly be inconsistent with our plans. We
manufacture products based on a combination of specific order
requirements and forecasts of our customer demands. Products are
typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of
an order. In certain circumstances, customers may cancel or
reschedule orders without penalty. Product sales are also
difficult to forecast because the network storage market is
rapidly evolving and our sales cycle varies substantially from
customer to customer.



Due to all of the foregoing factors, it is
possible that in one or more future quarters our results may
fall below the expectations of public market analysts and
investors. In such event, the trading price of our common stock
would likely decrease.

Our gross margins may vary based on the
configuration of our products.

We derive a significant portion of our sales from
the resale of disk drives as components of our filers, and the
resale market for hard disk drives is highly competitive and
subject to intense pricing pressures. Our sales of disk drives
generate lower gross margin percentages than those of our filer
products. As a result, as we sell more highly configured systems
with greater disk drive content, overall gross margin
percentages will be negatively affected. Conversely, we believe
our increased licensing of add-on software products may
favorably impact gross margins.

Our gross margins have been and may continue to
be affected by a variety of other factors, including:

A significant percentage of our expenses are
fixed, which could affect our net income.

Our expense levels are based in part on our
expectations as to future sales and a significant percentage of
our expenses are fixed. As a result, if sales levels are below
expectations or previously higher levels, net income will be
disproportionately affected.

Cost and expense control may be critical to
maintaining positive cash flow from operations and
profitability.

In fiscal 2002, we reduced fixed costs through
workforce reductions and a consolidation of facilities. We
believe strict cost containment is essential to maintaining
positive cash flow from operations and remaining profitable in
future quarters, especially since the outlook for future
quarters is subject to numerous challenges. Additional measures
to reduce expenses may be undertaken if revenues and market
conditions do not improve. A number of factors could preclude us
from successfully bringing costs and expenses in line with our
revenues, such as our inability to accurately forecast business
activities and deterioration of our revenues. If we are not able
to effectively control our costs and achieve an expense
structure commensurate with our business activities and
revenues, our cash flow and net income will be adversely
affected.

Our future financial performance depends on
growth in the network storage and content delivery markets, and
any lack of growth will have a material adverse effect on our
operating results.

All of our products address the storage and
content delivery markets. Accordingly, our future financial
performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the
storage and content delivery markets and on our ability to adapt
to emerging standards in these markets. We cannot assure you
that the markets for storage and content delivery will continue
to grow or that emerging standards in these markets will not
adversely affect the growth of UNIX, Windows, and the World Wide
Web server markets upon which we depend. In addition, our
business also depends on general economic and business
conditions. A reduction in demand for network



storage and content delivery caused by weakening
economic conditions and decreases in corporate spending have
resulted in decreased revenues and lower revenue growth rates.
The network storage and content delivery market growth declined
significantly beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2001,
causing both our revenues and operating results to decline. If
the network storage and content delivery markets grow more
slowly than anticipated or if emerging standards other than
those adopted by us become increasingly accepted by these
markets, our operating results could be materially adversely
affected.

The market price for our common stock has
fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to
do so in the future.

The market price for our common stock has
experienced substantial volatility in the past, and several
factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the
future. These factors include:

In addition, the stock market has experienced
volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of
equity securities of many high-technology companies.
Additionally, certain macroeconomic factors such as changes in
interest rates, the market climate for the high-technology
sector, and levels of corporate spending on information
technology could also have an impact on the trading price of our
stock. As a result, the market price of our common stock may
fluctuate significantly in the future and any broad market
decline, as well as our own operating results, may materially
adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

If we are unable to develop and introduce new
products and respond to technological change, or if our new
products do not achieve market acceptance, or if we fail to
manage the transition between our new and old products, our
operating results could be materially adversely
affected.

Our future growth depends upon the successful
development and introduction of new hardware and software
products. Due to the complexity of storage subsystems and
Internet caching devices, and the difficulty in gauging the
engineering effort required to produce new products, such
products are subject to significant technical risks. However, we
cannot assure you that any of our new products will achieve
market acceptance. Additional product introductions in future
periods may also impact the sales of existing products. In
addition, our new products must respond to technological changes
and evolving industry standards. If we are unable, for
technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new
products in a timely manner in response to changing market
conditions or customer requirements, or if such products do not
achieve market acceptance, our operating results could be
materially adversely affected.

In particular, in conjunction with the
introduction of our product offerings in the block-data storage
market, we have begun introducing products with new features and
functionality that address the storage area network (SAN)
market. We also introduced Direct Access File System
(DAFS) protocol-capable products and NearStore backup and
recovery products during fiscal 2002. We face risks relating to
these product introductions, including risks relating to
forecasting of demand for such products, as well as possible
product and software defects and a potentially different sales
and support environment associated with selling these new
systems. If any of the foregoing occur, our operating results
could be adversely affected.



As new or enhanced products are introduced, we
must successfully manage the transition from older products in
order to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering
patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories,
and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered
to meet customers’ demands.

Our business could be materially adversely
affected as a result of war or acts of terrorism.

Current global economic and political factors,
including terrorism, could harm our business. Weak economic
conditions, terrorist actions, and the effects of ongoing
military actions against terrorists could lead to significant
business interruptions. If such disruptions result in
cancellations of customer orders, a general decrease in
corporate spending on information technology, or direct impacts
on our marketing, manufacturing, financial functions or our
suppliers’ logistics function, our results of operations
and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We depend on attracting and retaining
qualified technical and sales personnel.

Our continued success depends, in part, on our
ability to identify, attract, motivate, and retain qualified
technical and sales personnel. Because our future success is
dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce
new products, we are particularly dependent on our ability to
identify, attract, motivate, and retain qualified engineers with
the requisite education, backgrounds, and industry experience.
Competition for qualified engineers, particularly in Silicon
Valley, is intense. The loss of the services of a significant
number of our engineers or sales people could be disruptive to
our development efforts or business relationships and could
materially adversely affect our operating results.

Risks inherent in our international operations
could have a material adverse effect on our operating
results.

We conduct business internationally. For fiscal
2002, approximately 42.0% of our total revenues were from
international customers (including United States exports).
Accordingly, our future operating results could be materially
adversely affected by a variety of factors, some of which are
beyond our control, including regulatory, political, or economic
conditions in a specific country or region, trade protection
measures and other regulatory requirements, government spending
patterns, and acts of terrorism and international conflicts.

Our international sales are denominated in U.S.
dollars and in foreign currencies. An increase in the value of
the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our
products more expensive and, therefore, potentially less
competitive in foreign markets. For international sales and
expenditures denominated in foreign currencies, we are subject
to risks associated with currency fluctuations. We hedge risks
associated with foreign currency transactions in order to
minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange
rates on earnings. We utilize forward contracts to hedge trade
and intercompany receivables and payables. All hedge contracts
are marked to market through earnings every period. There can be
no assurance that such hedging strategy will be successful and
that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a
material adverse effect on our operating results.

Additional risks inherent in our international
business activities generally include, among others, longer
accounts receivable payment cycles, difficulties in managing
international operations, and potentially adverse tax
consequences. Such factors could materially adversely affect our
future international sales and, consequently, our operating
results.

Although operating results have not been
materially adversely affected by seasonality in the past,
because of the significant seasonal effects experienced within
the industry, particularly in Europe, our future operating
results could be materially adversely affected by seasonality.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to
maintain or increase international market demand for our
products.



An increase in competition could materially
adversely affect our operating results.

The storage and content delivery markets are
intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing
technology.

In the storage market, our filer appliances and
data management software compete primarily against storage
products and data management software from EMC Corporation,
Hitachi Data Systems, Hewlett-Packard Company (including the
integrated Compaq Computer Corporation), IBM Corporation, and
Sun Microsystems, Inc. We have also historically encountered
less-frequent competition from companies including Auspex
Systems, Inc., Dell, LSI Logic Corp., MTI Corp., and Procom
Technology.

In the content delivery market, our NetCache
appliances and content delivery software compete against caching
appliance and content delivery software vendors including Cisco
Systems, Inc., CacheFlow, Inc., Inktomi Corp., and Akamai
Technologies, Inc.

Additionally a number of new, privately held
companies are currently attempting to enter our markets, some of
which may become significant competitors in the future.

We believe that the principal competitive factors
affecting our market include product benefits such as response
time, reliability, data availability, scalability, ease of use,
price, multiprotocol capabilities, and customer service and
support. Although we believe that our products currently compete
favorably with respect to these factors, we cannot assure you
that we can maintain our competitive position against current
and potential competitors, especially those with significantly
greater financial, marketing, service, support, technical, and
other resources.

Increased competition could result in price
reductions, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, any
of which could materially adversely affect our operating
results. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly
than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in
customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the
development, promotion, sale, and support of their products. In
addition, current and potential competitors have established or
may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with
third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors
or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire
significant market share. We cannot assure you that we will be
able to compete successfully against current or future
competitors. Competitive pressures we face could materially
adversely affect our operating results.

We rely on a limited number of suppliers and
any disruption or termination of these supply arrangements could
delay shipment of our products and could materially adversely
affect our operating results.

We rely on a limited number of suppliers of
several key components utilized in the assembly of our products.
We purchase most of our disk drives through a single supplier.
We purchase computer boards and microprocessors from a limited
number of suppliers. Our reliance on a limited number of
suppliers involves several risks, including:

Component quality is particularly significant
with respect to our suppliers of disk drives. In order to meet
product performance requirements, we must obtain disk drives of
extremely high quality and capacity. In addition, there are
periodic supply-and-demand issues for disk drives,
microprocessors, and for semiconductor memory components, which
could result in component shortages, selective supply
allocations, and increased prices of such components. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to obtain our full requirements
of such



components in the future or that prices of such
components will not increase. In addition, problems with respect
to yield and quality of such components and timeliness of
deliveries could occur. Disruption or termination of the supply
of these components could delay shipments of our products and
could materially adversely affect our operating results. Such
delays could also damage relationships with current and
prospective customers.

In addition, we license certain technology and
software from third parties that is incorporated into our
products. If we are unable to obtain or license the technology
and software on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver
product to our customers in a timely manner.

The loss of our sole contract manufacturer or
    the failure to accurately forecast demand for our products or
    successfully manage our relationship with our contract
    manufacturer could negatively impact our ability to manufacture
    and sell our products.

We currently rely on a contract manufacturer to
manufacture most of our products. Our reliance on a third-party
contract manufacturer reduces our control over the manufacturing
process, exposing us to risks including reduced control over
quality assurance, production costs, and product supply. If we
should fail to effectively manage our relationship with our
contract manufacturer, or if our contract manufacturer
experiences delays, disruptions, capacity constraints, or
quality control problems in its manufacturing operations, our
ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed and
our competitive position and reputation could be harmed.
Qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume
production are expensive and time-consuming. If we are required
to change contract manufacturers or assume internal
manufacturing operations, we may lose revenue and damage our
customer relationships. If we inaccurately forecast demand for
our products, we may have excess or inadequate inventory, or
incur cancellation charges or penalties, which could adversely
impact our operating results.

We intend to regularly introduce new products and
product enhancements, which will require us to rapidly achieve
volume production by coordinating with our contract manufacturer
and suppliers. We may need to increase our material purchases,
contract manufacturing capacity, and internal test and quality
functions to meet anticipated demand. The inability of our
contract manufacturer to provide us with adequate supplies of
high-quality products, or the ability to obtain raw materials,
could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders.

We may incur problems with current or future
    equity investments and acquisitions, and these investments may
    not achieve our objectives.

From time to time, we make equity investments for
the promotion of business and strategic objectives. We have
already made strategic investments in a number of network
storage-related technology companies. Equity investments may
result in the loss of investment capital. The market price and
valuation of our equity investments in these companies may
fluctuate due to market conditions and other circumstances over
which we have little or no control, and recent events have
adversely affected the public equity market. To the extent that
the fair value of these securities is less than our cost over an
extended period of time, our results of operations and financial
position could be negatively impacted. In the second quarter of
fiscal 2002, we recorded a noncash, other-than-temporary
write-down of $13.0 million related to impairments of our
investments in publicly traded and private companies.

As part of our strategy, we are continuously
evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies
that would complement our current products, expand the breadth
of our markets, or enhance our technical capabilities. We have
acquired two companies since the beginning of fiscal 2001. We
may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our
stockholders’ investments and cause us to use cash, to
incur debt, or to assume contingent liabilities.

Acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks,
and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired
operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies,
economies of scale, or other value. In addition, we may
experience a diversion of management’s attention, the loss
of key employees of acquired



operations, or the inability to recover strategic
investments in development stage entities. Any such problems
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operation.

We do not have exclusive relationships with
    our resellers and accordingly there is a risk that those
    resellers may give higher priority to products of other
    suppliers, which could materially adversely affect our operating
    results.

Our reseller partners generally offer products
from several different companies, including products of our
competitors. Accordingly, there is risk that these resellers may
give higher priority to products of other suppliers, which could
materially adversely affect our operating results.

Undetected software errors or failures found
    in new products may result in loss of or delay in market
    acceptance of our products, which could materially adversely
    affect our operating results.

Our products may contain undetected software
errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are
released. Despite testing by us and by current and potential
customers, errors may not be found in new products until after
commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of or
delay in market acceptance, which could materially adversely
affect our operating results.

If we are unable to protect our intellectual
    property we may be subject to increased competition that could
    materially adversely affect our operating results.

Our success depends significantly upon our
proprietary technology. We currently rely on a combination of
copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality
procedures, contractual provisions, and patents to protect our
proprietary rights. We seek to protect our software,
documentation, and other written materials under trade secret,
copyright, and patent laws, which afford only limited
protection. Some United States trademarks and some
United States-registered trademarks are registered
internationally as well. We will continue to evaluate the
registration of additional trademarks as appropriate. We
generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our
employees and with our resellers and customers. We currently
have multiple United States and international patent
applications pending and multiple United States patents issued.
The pending applications may not be approved and if patents are
issued, such patents may be challenged. If such challenges are
brought, the patents may be invalidated. We cannot assure you
that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that
are patentable, that any issued patent will provide us with any
competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third
parties, or that the patents of others will not materially
adversely affect our ability to do business.

Litigation may be necessary to protect our
proprietary technology. Any such litigation may be
time-consuming and costly. Despite our efforts to protect our
proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy
aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we
regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign
countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an
extent as do the laws of the United States. We cannot
assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights
will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently
develop similar technology, duplicate our products, or design
around patents issued to us or other intellectual property
rights of ours.

We are subject to intellectual property
infringement claims. We may, from time to time, receive claims
that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property
rights. Third parties may in the future claim infringement by us
with respect to current or future products, patents, trademarks,
or other proprietary rights. We expect that companies in the
appliance market will increasingly be subject to infringement
claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry
segment grows and the functionality of products in different
industry segments overlaps. Any such claims could be
time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product
shipment delays, require us to redesign our products or require
us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which
could materially adversely affect our operating results. Such
royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be
available on terms acceptable to us or at all.



Item 2.

Properties

In fiscal 2002, we terminated our operating lease
obligations for our Sunnyvale headquarters site by purchasing
the land and buildings for $249.8 million. Our headquarters site
for corporate general administration, sales and marketing,
research and development, customer services, and manufacturing
operations occupies approximately 675,000 square feet of
buildings in Sunnyvale, California.

We lease other sales offices and research and
development facilities throughout the United States and
internationally. We believe that our existing facilities and
those being developed in Sunnyvale are adequate for our
requirements over at least the next two years and that
additional space will be available as needed.

As a result of reductions in headcount in fiscal
2002, we are not currently utilizing certain existing space in
our California headquarters site. Additionally, we have also
exited office space under noncancellable leases in other
locations, both in the United States and Europe. If we are
unable to successfully sublease our vacated and unoccupied
office space, our operating results may be adversely affected.
See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

See additional discussion regarding properties in
“Note 4 under Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” and “Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

We are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and
litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We defend
ourselves vigorously against any such claims. While the outcome
of these matters is currently not determinable, management does
not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will
have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Item 4.

Submissions of Matters to a
Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security
holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

PART II

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s
Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters

Our common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq
National Market on November 21, 1995, and is traded under
the symbol “NTAP.” As of April 26, 2002, there
were 944 holders of record of the common stock. The
following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high
and low closing sale prices for our common stock as reported on
the Nasdaq National Market.

We believe that a number of factors may cause the
market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. See
“Item 1. Business — Risk Factors.”

We have never paid cash dividends on our capital
stock. We currently anticipate retaining all available funds, if
any, to finance internal growth and product development. Payment
of dividends in the future will depend upon our earnings and
financial condition and such other factors as the directors may
consider or deem appropriate at the time.



Item 6.

Selected Consolidated
Financial Data

Five fiscal years ended April 30,

(In thousands, except per-share
amounts)

All Net Income per Share amounts have been
adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock splits which were
effective November 11, 1997, December 21, 1998,
December 20, 1999 and March 22, 2000.



Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read together with
the financial statements and the related notes set forth under
“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data” and the Risk Factors set forth in “Item 1.
Business.”

Critical Accounting Policies

Our discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations is based upon our
Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The preparation of these Consolidated
Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, our
estimates and judgments, including those related to sales
returns, bad debts, excess inventory and purchase commitments,
investments, intangible assets, lease losses and restructuring
accruals, income taxes, and contingencies. We base our estimates
on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ
from these estimates.

We believe the accounting policies described
below, among others, are the ones that most frequently require
us to make estimates and judgments, and therefore are critical
to the understanding of our results of operations:

Revenue recognition and allowances

We apply the provisions of Statement of Position
(“SOP”) 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition”
(as amended by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9), and related
interpretations to all revenue transactions. We recognize
revenue when:

Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists.

It is our customary practice to have a
purchase order prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement.

Delivery Has Occurred.

Our product is physically delivered to
our customers, generally with standard transfer terms as FOB
shipping point. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or
return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria
are achieved. If undelivered products or services exist that are
essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an
arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred.

The Fee Is Fixed or Determinable.

Arrangements with payment terms
extending beyond our standard terms and condition practices are
not considered to be fixed or determinable. Revenue from such
arrangements is recognized as the fees become due and payable.

Collection Is Probable.

Probability of collection is assessed
on a customer-by-customer basis. Customers are subjected to a
credit review process that evaluates the customers’
financial position and ultimately their ability to pay. If it is
determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection is
not probable based upon our review process, revenue is
recognized upon cash receipt.

For arrangements with multiple elements, we
allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based
on vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered items.
We defer the portion of the arrangement fee equal to the fair
value of the undelivered elements until they are delivered.
Vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged
when the element is sold separately.



A typical arrangement includes product, software
subscription, and maintenance. Some arrangements include
training and consulting. Software subscriptions include
unspecified products upgrades and enhancements on a
when-and-if-available basis, bug fixes, and patch releases, and
are included in product revenues. Service maintenance includes
contracts for technical support and hardware maintenance.
Revenue from software subscriptions and maintenance is
recognized ratably over the contractual term, generally one to
three years. Revenue from training and consulting is recognized
as the services are performed.

We record reductions to revenue for estimated
sales returns at the time of shipment. These estimates are based
on historical sales returns, changes in customer demand, and
other factors. If actual future returns and allowances differ
from past experience, additional allowances may be required.

We also maintain a separate allowance for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of our customers to make required payments. We analyze
accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer solvency, current economic and
geographic trends, and changes in customer payment terms and
practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for
doubtful accounts. If the financial condition of our customers
deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to
make payments, additional allowances may be required.

Inventory write-down

We write-down inventory and record purchase
commitment liabilities for estimated excess and obsolete
inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory
and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future
demand and market conditions. Although we strive to ensure the
accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any
significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological
developments could have a significant impact on the value of our
inventory and commitments, and our reported results. If actual
market conditions are less favorable than those projected,
additional write-downs and other charges against earnings may be
required.

We engage in extensive product quality programs
and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the
quality of our component suppliers. We also provide for the
estimated cost of known product failures based on known quality
issues when they arise. Should actual cost of product failure
differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated liability
would be required.

Restructuring accruals and impairment losses
on investments

In fiscal 2002, as a result of continuing
unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in IT spending
rates, we implemented two restructuring plans, which included
reductions in workforce and a consolidation of facilities.

We performed a comprehensive analysis of our real
estate facility requirements and identified excess facility
space, which has subsequently been offered for sublease. Based
upon the results of this analysis, during fiscal 2002, we
recorded charges related to estimated facilities lease losses,
net of expected sublease income. In determining the net
facilities charge, various assumptions were made, including the
time period over which the facilities will be vacant, expected
sublease terms, and expected sublease rates. The charges
recorded were estimates in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 5,
“Accounting for Contingencies,” and represented the
low end of an estimated range that may be adjusted upon the
occurrence of future triggering events. Triggering events may
include, but are not limited to, changes in estimated time to
sublease the facilities, sublease terms, sublease rates, and
lease termination. Should operating lease rental rates decline
or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant
to sublease the facility, adjustments to the facilities lease
losses liabilities may be necessary in future periods based upon
the then-current actual events and circumstances. During the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we purchased our Sunnyvale
headquarters site and terminated the operating leases. As a
result, an adjustment was made to reduce the previously recorded
estimated facilities lease losses by $1.5 million.

In fiscal 2002, we also recorded charges for a
reduction in workforce in response to a decline in customer
demand and macroeconomic conditions. See footnote 12 —

Restructuring Charges

for further discussion.



These estimates are reviewed and revised
quarterly and may result in a substantial change to
restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than
were anticipated in original management estimates.

Our investments in publicly held companies are
generally considered impaired when a decline in the fair value
of an investment as measured by quoted market prices is less
than its carrying value, and such a decline is not considered
temporary. Our investments in privately held companies are
considered impaired when a review of the investees’
operations and other indicators of impairment indicate that the
carrying value of the investment is not likely to be
recoverable. Such indicators include, but are not limited to,
limited capital resources, limited prospects of receiving
additional financing, and limited prospects for liquidity of the
related securities. During fiscal 2002, we recorded a noncash,
other-than-temporary write-down of $13.0 million related to
impairments of our investments in publicly traded and private
companies. See footnote 2 —

Short-Term Investments

and

Investments in Nonpublic Companies

for further
discussion.

Valuation of intangible assets and
goodwill

We periodically evaluate our intangible assets
and goodwill for indications of impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable. Intangible assets include goodwill,
purchased technology, and workforce. Factors we consider
important that could trigger an impairment review include
significant under-performance relative to expected historical or
projected future operating results, significant changes in the
manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our
overall business, or significant negative industry or economic
trends. If these criteria indicate that the value of the
intangible asset may be impaired, an evaluation of the
recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its
remaining useful life is made. If this evaluation indicates that
the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows of the entity or technology
acquired over the remaining amortization period, the net
carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced
to fair value, and the remaining amortization period may be
adjusted. Any such impairment charge could be significant and
could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial
statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded. If an
impairment charge is recognized, the amortization related to
goodwill and other intangible assets would decrease during the
remainder of the fiscal year. No impairment losses were recorded
during fiscal 2002 based on these measurements.

Accounting for income taxes

The determination of our tax provision is subject
to judgments and estimates due to operations in several tax
jurisdictions outside the United States. Sales to our
international customers are generally taxed at rates that are
lower than U.S. rates, resulting in a reduction of our effective
tax rate. The ability to maintain our current effective tax rate
is contingent upon existing tax laws in both the United States
and in the respective countries in which our international
subsidiaries are located. Future changes in domestic or
international tax laws could affect the continued realization of
the tax benefits we are currently receiving and expect to
receive from international sales. In addition, a decrease in the
percentage of our total revenue from international customers or
in the mix of international revenue among particular tax
jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate.
Also, our current effective tax rate assumes that U.S. income
taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of certain
non-U.S. subsidiaries. These earnings could become subject to
incremental foreign withholding or federal and state income
taxes should they be either deemed or actually remitted to the
U.S.

The carrying value of our net deferred tax
assets, which is made up primarily of income tax deductions,
credits, and net operating loss carryforwards resulting from
stock option exercises, assumes that we will be able to generate
sufficient future income to fully utilize these tax deductions
and credits. If we do not generate sufficient future income, the
realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired
resulting in additional income tax expense. We have provided a
valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets
because of uncertainty regarding their realizability due to
expectation of future employee stock option exercises.



New Accounting Standards

On May 1, 2001, we adopted SFAS 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” The adoption of this accounting standard did
not have a significant impact on our financial position, results
of operations, or cash flow.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 141,
“Business Combinations,” and SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Under SFAS
No. 141, all business combinations initiated after
June 30, 2001 must be accounted for using the purchase
method. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed
annually for impairment (or more frequently if indicators of
impairment arise). Separable intangible assets that are not
deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized
over their useful lives (but with no maximum life). The
amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142 apply to goodwill
and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001. With
respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to
July 1, 2001, we are required to adopt SFAS No. 142
effective May 1, 2002. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142,
we will stop the amortization of goodwill (including acquired
existing workforce) with a net carrying value of approximately
$49.8 million at April 30, 2002, and the annual
amortization of $15.2 million that resulted from business
combinations initiated prior to the adoption. We will evaluate
goodwill under the SFAS No. 142 transitional impairment
test. Any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as a
change in accounting principle on the date of adoption. We have
not determined whether adoption of SFAS No. 142 will have
an impact on our financial position, results of operations, and
cash flow.

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets,” which addresses financial accounting
and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
assets. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121,
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Assets to Be Disposed Of.” Adoption of SFAS No. 144 is
required for our fiscal year beginning May 1, 2002. We are
currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption of SFAS
No. 144 on our financial position and results of operations
and have not yet determined the impact of adopting this
statement.



Results of Operations

The following table sets forth certain
consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of
total revenues for the periods indicated:

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001

Product
Revenues

— Product revenues
decreased by 23.8% to $729.9 million in fiscal 2002, from
$957.8 million in fiscal 2001. The decline in product
revenues was due to a decrease in product sales to
Internet-based companies and reduced capital spending among
technology companies across all geographies, but primarily in
North America. This decrease in product revenues for fiscal 2002
was specifically attributable to a lower volume of units and
software licenses shipped, as compared to fiscal 2001.

Product revenues were negatively impacted by the
following factors:

Product revenues were favorably impacted by the
following factors:

•

increased sales from new industry verticals:
    energy, telecommunications, financial services, manufacturing,
    life sciences and the government;

•

a higher average selling price of our new
    products: our high-end F880 and low-end F87 filer products, as
    well as new NetCache appliances and software features;



Service
Revenues

— Service revenues
increased by 41.6% to $68.5 million in fiscal 2002, from
$48.4 million in fiscal 2001. Service revenue is generally
deferred and, in most cases, recognized ratably over the service
period obligations, which are typically one to three years. The
increase in service revenues (representing 8.6 % and 4.8% of
total revenues for fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively) was
primarily related to a growing installed base resulting in new
customer support contracts in addition to support contract
renewals by existing customers.

International total revenues (including United
States exports) decreased by 12.4% for fiscal 2002 as compared
to fiscal 2001. International total revenues were
$335.2 million, or 42.0% of total revenues for fiscal 2002.
The decline in international sales for fiscal 2002 was primarily
a result of a slower demand in the Europe and Asia Pacific
markets offset by our increased sales and marketing efforts
internationally.

Product Gross
Margin

— Product gross
margin decreased to 64.1% of product revenues for fiscal 2002 as
compared to 64.3% in fiscal 2001.

Product gross margin was negatively impacted by:

Product gross margin was favorably impacted by:



Service Gross
Margin

— Service gross
margin increased to 18.2% for fiscal 2002 as compared to a
negative gross margin of 23.8% in fiscal 2001. Investments in
customer service decreased by 6.5% to $56.0 million in
fiscal 2002, from $59.9 million in fiscal 2001. The
improvement in service gross margin in fiscal 2002 was primarily
due to operational and cost efficiencies in the global customer
service organizations. The negative service gross margin in
fiscal 2001 was due to the ramping up and continued investment
in our service infrastructure in anticipation of service revenue
growth.

Sales and
Marketing

— Sales and
marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions,
advertising and promotional expenses, and certain customer
service and support costs. Sales and marketing expenses
decreased 1.6% to $284.4 million for fiscal 2002, from
$289.0 million for fiscal 2001. These expenses were 35.6%
and 28.7% of total revenues for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001,
respectively. The decrease in absolute dollars was attributed to
various cost control and reduction measures, restructuring
impact, lower commission expenses and other profit-dependent
payroll-related expenses, and disposal of certain capital assets
in fiscal 2001, partially offset by the continued worldwide
investment in our sales and customer service organizations.
Sales and marketing headcount decreased to 1,224 in fiscal 2002,
from 1,277 in fiscal 2001 due primarily to the restructuring
impact. We expect to continue to selectively add sales capacity
in an effort to expand domestic and international markets,
introduce new products, establish and expand new distribution
channels, and increase product and company awareness. We expect
to increase our sales and marketing expenses commensurate with
future revenue growth.

Research and
Development

— Research and
development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits,
prototype expenses, non-recurring engineering charges, and fees
paid to outside consultants. Research and development expenses
decreased 3.5% to $116.7 million in fiscal 2002, from
$120.9 million in fiscal 2001. These expenses represented
14.6% and 12.0% of total revenues for fiscal 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Research and development expenses decreased in
absolute dollars, primarily as a result of cost control,
reduction in discretionary spending efforts, restructuring
impact, the two holiday facility shutdowns, lower headcount, and
lower profit-dependent payroll related expenses, partially
offset by the operating impact of the Orca Systems, Inc.
(“Orca”) and WebManage Technologies, Inc.
(“WebManage”) acquisitions. Research and development
headcount decreased to 514 in fiscal 2002, from 566 in fiscal
2001. We expect to continuously support current and future
product development and enhancement efforts, and incur
prototyping expenses and non-recurring engineering charges
associated with the development of new products and technologies.

We believe that our future performance will
depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our
current product line, develop new products that achieve market
acceptance, maintain technological competitiveness, and meet an
expanding range of customer requirements. We intend to
continuously expand our existing product offerings and introduce
new products, and expect that expenditures for these purposes
will increase in absolute dollars. For both fiscal 2002 and
2001, no software development costs were capitalized.

General and
Administrative

— General and
administrative expenses decreased 0.1% to $40.2 million in
fiscal 2002, from $40.2 million in fiscal 2001. These
expenses represented 5.0% and 4.0% of total revenues for fiscal
2002 and 2001, respectively. Decreases in absolute dollars were
primarily due to cost controls, reductions in discretionary
spending, the impact of restructuring, the two holiday facility
shutdowns, and lower profit-dependent payroll related expenses,
partially offset by expenses associated with initiatives to
enhance enterprise-wide management information systems, general
legal costs, and an increase in the allowance for bad debts.
General and administrative headcount decreased to 246 in fiscal
2002, from 253 in fiscal 2001. We believe that our general and
administrative expenses will not increase significantly in
absolute dollars in fiscal 2003.

Amortization of Intangible
Assets

— Amortization of
intangible assets represents the amortization on acquired
intangible assets and amortization on the excess of the
aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired by us. Intangible assets
as of April 30, 2002, including goodwill, existing
workforce, and technology, were being amortized over estimated
useful lives of three to five years. We assess the
recoverability of intangible assets by determining whether the
amortized asset over its useful life may be recovered through
estimated useful cash flows. Amortization of intangible assets
charged to operations was $20.9 million and $11.7 million
in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively.



In-process Research and
Development

— We incurred
in-process research and development charges of approximately
$26.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2001 related
to the acquisition of Orca. The purchase price of the
transaction was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities
based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the
acquisition. Approximately $26.7 million was allocated to
in-process research and development and charged to operations,
because the acquired technology had not reached technological
feasibility and had no alternative uses. The value was
determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired
in-process technology into commercially viable products,
estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects, and
discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The
discount rate included a factor that took into account the
uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the
acquired in-process technology. These estimates are subject to
change, given the uncertainties of the development process, and
no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates
will not occur. Research and development costs to bring the
products from Orca to technological feasibility are not expected
to have a material impact on our future results of operations or
financial condition.

The Orca acquisition has been successfully
utilized for the design and development of the DAFS protocol. By
eliminating much of the traditional operating system overhead,
DAFS allows for improved I/ O performance while using fewer CPU
cycles. The protocol leverages next generation networking
technologies that provide remote memory transfer capabilities,
including Remote Direct Memory Access (“RDMA”)
implemented in Virtual Interface (“VI”) and
Infiniband. The DAFS protocol has good industry support and is
now under consideration as an industry standard. We introduced
DAFS capable products in April 2002.

Stock
Compensation

— We account
for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance
with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees,” and comply with the provisions of SFAS
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” for non-employee compensation awards.
Accordingly, we recognize the intrinsic value for employees and
the fair value for non-employees as stock compensation expense
over the vesting terms of the awards. Stock compensation
expenses were $7.2 million and $6.2 million in fiscal
2002 and 2001, respectively. This increase was primarily
attributable to the recognition of stock compensation on options
assumed in the WebManage acquisition and the release of 165,310
contingently issuable milestone shares relating to Orca valued
at $3.0 million. We expect an additional stock compensation
relating to 99,187 contingently issuable Orca common share, to
be measured on the date the performance criteria are met.

Restructuring
Charges

— In August 2001, we
implemented a restructuring plan, which included a reduction in
workforce by approximately 200 employees and a consolidation of
facilities. The action was required to properly align and manage
the business commensurate with our then-current revenue levels.
All functional areas of the Company were affected by the
reduction. We completed our actions during the second quarter of
fiscal 2002. As a result of this restructuring, we incurred a
charge of $8.0 million. The restructuring charge included
$4.8 million of severance-related amounts,
$2.7 million of committed excess facilities and facility
closure expenses, and $0.5 million in fixed assets
write-offs.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we
purchased our Sunnyvale headquarters site and terminated the
operating leases. As a result, an adjustment was made to reduce
the previously recorded estimated facilities lease losses by
$1.5 million.

As of April 30, 2002, we had paid
substantially all of the severance liability. Of the balance at
April 30, 2002, $0.5 million was included in other
accrued liabilities.



The following analysis sets forth the significant
components of the second quarter fiscal 2002 restructuring at
April 30, 2002 (in thousands):

In April 2002, we announced and substantially
completed a restructuring related to the closure of an
engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the
Sunnyvale headquarters, which included a headcount reduction of
34 employees. As a result of this restructuring, we incurred a
charge of $5.9 million. The restructuring charge included
$0.8 million of severance-related amounts,
$4.6 million of committed excess facilities and facility
closure expenses, and $0.5 million in fixed assets
write-offs. Of the reserve balance at April 30, 2002,
$1.1 million was included in other accrued liabilities and
the remaining $3.6 million was classified as long-term
obligations.

The following analysis sets forth the significant
components of the fourth quarter fiscal 2002 restructuring at
April 30, 2002 (in thousands):

We expect annual cost savings of approximately
$29.8 million as a result of the restructuring and
reduction in force actions taken in the second and fourth
quarters of fiscal 2002.

Interest Income and Other,
Net

— During fiscal 2002,
interest income and other, net was $16.6 million, as
compared to $23.4 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease in
interest income was primarily due to lower average interest
rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances
from cash, short-term investments and restricted cash generated
from operations. We expect interest income to decline further in
fiscal 2003, as existing investments mature and proceeds are
reinvested in a lower interest-rate environment. Interest income
and other, net also included gains and losses from foreign
currency transactions.

Impairment Loss on
Investments

— We perform
periodic reviews of our investments for impairment. Our
investments in publicly held companies are generally considered
impaired when a decline in the fair value of an investment as
measured by quoted market prices is less than its carrying
value, and such a decline is not considered temporary. Our
investments in privately held companies are considered impaired
when a review of the investees’ operations and other
indicators of impairment indicate that the carrying value of the
investment is not likely to be recoverable. Such indicators
include, but are not limited to, limited capital resources,
limited prospects of receiving additional financing, and limited
prospects for liquidity of the related securities. In the second
quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded a noncash,
other-than-temporary write-down of $13.0 million related to
impairments of our investments in publicly traded and private
companies. During fiscal 2002 and 2001, we sold shares of
certain marketable equity securities and the realized gains for
those periods were not material.

Provision (Benefit), for Income
Taxes

— For fiscal 2002, we
applied an annual benefit rate of 19.7% to pretax loss. For
fiscal 2001, our effective tax rate was 34.5%, which excluded
the effect of non-deductible amortization of goodwill and the
write-off of acquired in-process research and development. Our
estimate is based on existing tax laws and our current
projections of income/(loss) and distributions of income/(loss)
among different entities and tax jurisdictions, and is subject
to change, based primarily on varying levels of profitability.



Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000

Business
Combinations

— During the
first quarter of fiscal 2001, we acquired Orca for a purchase
price of $50.0 million in common stock, assumed options and
cash, with an obligation to provide 264,497 shares of common
stock, which will result in additional stock compensation
charges if certain performance criteria are achieved. We also
paid certain transaction costs and assumed certain operating
assets and liabilities. The acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase. The purchase price of the transaction was allocated to
the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated
fair values as of the date of the acquisition. Amounts allocated
to existing workforce and goodwill are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over three-and five-year periods,
respectively. Approximately $26.7 million was allocated to
in-process research and development and charged to operations
because the acquired technology had not reached technological
feasibility and had no alternative uses.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2001, we
acquired WebManage for $59.4 million in common stock, assumed
options and cash, with an obligation to provide shares of common
stock to be valued at $3.0 million, if certain performance
criteria are achieved. The performance criteria were met in
March 2001 and the contingent consideration has been recorded as
stock compensation in the fourth quarter of 2001. We also paid
certain transaction costs and assumed certain operating assets
and liabilities. The acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase. The purchase price of the transaction was allocated to
the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated
fair values as of the date of the acquisition. Amounts allocated
to existing technology and workforce are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over three years and amounts allocated to
goodwill are being amortized over five years.

Product
Revenues

— Product revenues
increased by 71.9% to $957.8 million in fiscal 2001, from
$557.4 million in fiscal 2000. Product revenues growth was
across all geographies, products and markets. This increase in
product revenues for fiscal 2001 was primarily attributable to a
higher volume of units shipped, as compared to fiscal 2000. This
growth in volume declined in the second half of fiscal 2001.
Factors impacting unit growth include:

Product revenues growth was also positively
impacted by:



•

higher software subscription (representing 3.6 %
    and 2.9% of total revenues for fiscal 2001 and 2000,
    respectively).

Overall product revenues growth was partially
offset by:

•

declining demand for our products in the second
    half of fiscal 2001;

•

declining average selling price of the F700
    filers and caching products due to competitive pricing; and

•

declining unit sales of our older products.

Service
Revenues

— Service revenues
increased by 120.3% to $48.4 million in fiscal 2001, from
$21.9 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in service
revenues (representing 4.8 % and 3.8% of total revenues for
fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively) was primarily related to a
growing installed base needing maintenance and technical support.

International total revenues (including United
States exports) grew by 115.0% for fiscal 2001 as compared to
fiscal 2000. International total revenues were
$382.5 million, or 38.0% of total revenues for fiscal 2001.
The increase in international revenues for fiscal 2001, was
primarily a result of European and Asia Pacific total revenues
growth, due to increased headcount in the direct sales force,
increased indirect channel sales, increased shipments of filers,
Cluster Failover solutions and NetCache appliances and increased
sales of add-on software licenses, as compared to the
corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.

Product Gross
Margin

— Product gross
margin increased to 64.3% of product revenues for fiscal 2001,
from 62.8% for fiscal 2000.

Product gross margin was favorably impacted by:

Gross margin was negatively impacted by:

Service Gross
Margin

— Service gross
margin was negative 23.8% for fiscal 2001 as compared to
negative gross margin of 29.3% in fiscal 2000. Investments in
customer service increased by 111.1% to $59.9 million in
fiscal 2001, from $28.4 million in fiscal 2000. The
negative service gross margin in both fiscal 2001 and 2000 was
due to the ramping up and continued investment in our service
infrastructure in anticipation of service revenues growth.

Sales and
Marketing

— Sales and
marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions,
advertising and promotional expenses, and certain customer
service and support costs. Sales and marketing expenses
increased 87.8% to $289.0 million for fiscal 2001 from
$153.9 million for fiscal 2000. These expenses were
28.7% and 26.6% of total revenues for fiscal 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The increase in absolute dollars



was primarily related to the continued worldwide
expansion of our sales and customer service organizations,
expansion of various marketing and industry initiatives,
increased commission expenses in the first three quarters and
disposal of certain capital assets in the fourth quarter. Sales
and marketing headcount increased to 1,277 in fiscal 2001
from 775 in fiscal 2000.

Research and
Development

— Research
and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and
benefits, prototype expenses, non-recurring engineering charges,
and fees paid to outside consultants. Research and development
expenses increased 96.4% to $120.9 million in
fiscal 2001 from $61.6 million in fiscal 2000. These
expenses represented 12.0% and 10.6% of total revenues, for
fiscal year 2001 and 2000, respectively. Research and
development expenses increased in absolute dollars, primarily as
a result of increased headcount, operating impact of Orca and
WebManage acquisitions, ongoing support of current and future
product development and enhancement efforts, prototyping
expenses and non-recurring engineering charges associated with
the development of new products and technologies, including the
NetApp F85, F800 series filers and the new generation of
our NetCache appliances coupled with our content distribution
and reporting software. Research and development headcount
increased to 566 in fiscal 2001 from 327 in
fiscal 2000. We believe that our future performance will
depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our
current product line, develop new products that achieve market
acceptance, maintain technological competitiveness and meet an
expanding range of customer requirements. For both
fiscal 2001 and 2000, no software development costs were
capitalized.

General and
Administrative

— General
and administrative expenses increased 90.7% to
$40.2 million in fiscal 2001, from $21.1 million in
fiscal 2000. These expenses represented 4.0% and 3.6% of total
revenues, for fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively. Increases
in absolute dollars were primarily due to increased headcount,
expenses associated with initiatives to enhance enterprise-wide
management information systems and increased professional
service fees. General and administrative headcount increased to
253 in fiscal 2001 from 162 in fiscal 2000.

Amortization of Intangible
Assets

— Amortization
of intangible assets represents the excess of the aggregate
purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired by us. Intangible assets
as of April 30, 2001, including goodwill, existing
workforce and technology, are being amortized over the estimated
useful life of three to five-year periods. We assess the
recoverability of intangible assets by determining whether the
amortized asset over its useful life may be recovered through
estimated useful cash flows. Amortization of intangible assets
charged to operations was $11.7 million and
$0.2 million in fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively.

In-process Research and
Development

— We
incurred in-process research and development charges of
approximately $26.7 million in fiscal 2001 related to the
acquisition of Orca. The purchase price of the transaction was
allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their
estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition.
Approximately $26.7 million was allocated to in-process
research and development and charged to operations, because the
acquired technology had not reached technological feasibility
and had no alternative uses. The value was determined by
estimating the costs to develop the acquired in-process
technology into commercially viable products, estimating the
resulting net cash flows from such projects, and discounting the
net cash flows back to their present value. The discount rate
included a factor that took into account the uncertainty
surrounding the successful development of the acquired
in-process technology. These estimates are subject to change,
given the uncertainties of the development process, and no
assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will
not occur. Research and development costs to bring the products
from Orca to technological feasibility are not expected to have
a material impact on our future results of operations or
financial condition.

We believe we can utilize the Orca acquisition to
develop the first virtual interface-based (VI) next
generation of network storage systems. We are leveraging VI
architecture to develop the DAFS protocol. DAFS enables data
transfers straight from the file server, allowing clusters of
application servers in heterogeneous environments to share data
from the memory of one system to the memory of another without
involving general-purpose operating systems, thereby improving
CPU utilization and speeding up data access. We expect to
continue the development of products using this protocol and
believe that there is a reasonable



chance of successfully delivering initial
products in calendar year 2001. However, there is risk
associated with the completion of the in-process project and
there can be no assurance that such project will meet with
either technological or commercial success. Failure to
successfully develop and commercialize this in-process project
would result in the loss of the expected economic return
inherent in the fair value allocation. Additionally, the value
of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired. The
risks associated with the research and development are still
considered high and no assurance can be made that upcoming
products will meet market expectations or gain market acceptance.

Stock
Compensation

— We
account for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in
accordance with provisions of APB No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees,” for employee compensation
awards and comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” for
non-employee compensation awards. Accordingly, we recognize the
intrinsic value for employees and the fair value for
non-employees as stock compensation expense over the vesting
terms of the awards. Stock compensation expenses were
$6.2 million and $1.3 million in fiscal 2001 and
2000, respectively. This increase was primarily attributable to
the recognition of stock compensation of unvested options
assumed in the WebManage acquisition, issuance of contingently
issuable milestone shares, increased participation in the
salaried stock option grant program by certain highly
compensated employees and non-employee stock options awards.

Total Other Income,
net

— Total other
income, net, was $23.4 million and $9.0 million in
fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in interest
income was primarily due to increased cash and short-term
investments generated from operations and net proceeds from
stock option exercises.

Provision for Income
Taxes

— Our effective
tax was 34.5%, excluding the effect of non-deductible
amortization of goodwill and acquired in-process research and
development of $35.5 million for fiscal 2001. The effective
tax rate for fiscal 2000 was 35.5%. The effective tax rates
differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to state
taxes, credits, tax exempt interest, goodwill amortization and
acquired in-process research and development.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We derive our liquidity and capital resources
primarily from our cash flow from operations and from working
capital, which increased by $46.8 million to
$463.6 million. As of April 30, 2002, as compared to
the April 30, 2001 balances, our cash, cash equivalents,
and short-term investments increased by $90.1 million to
$454.1 million. We generated cash from operating activities
totaling $143.9 million and $218.4 million in fiscal
2002 and 2001, respectively. Net cash provided by operating
activities in fiscal 2002 was principally related to net income
of $3.0 million, decreases in accounts receivable, and
increases in other accrued liabilities, deferred revenue,
coupled with depreciation, impairment loss on investments,
amortization of intangibles and stock compensation, partially
offset by decreases in accounts payable, accrued compensation
and related benefits and increases in inventories.

In addition to lower net income in fiscal 2002,
the primary factors that impacted the period-to-period change in
cash flows relating to operating activities included the
following:



The above factors were partially offset by the
effects of:

We used $284.2 million and
$83.7 million of cash in fiscal 2002 and 2001,
respectively, for capital expenditures. The fiscal 2002 increase
in property and equipment includes the purchase of the land and
buildings at our Sunnyvale headquarters site for
$249.8 million. Since we have curtailed capital
expenditures, purchases of fixed assets were only
$34.4 million in fiscal 2002, compared to
$83.7 million the same period a year ago. The decrease was
primarily attributed to the slowdown in hiring and various cost
control and cutting measures. We have used $149.9 million
and $14.3 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively,
for net purchases of short-term investments. In the first
quarter of fiscal 2001, we acquired Orca for a purchase price of
approximately $50.0 million, including common stock,
contingently issuable common stock, assumed options, cash
payments of $2.0 million and related transaction costs. In
the third quarter of 2001, we acquired WebManage for a purchase
price of approximately $59.4 million, including common
stock, assumed options, cash payments of $5.0 million and
related transaction costs. Investing activities in fiscal 2002
and 2001 also included new equity investments of
$1.1 million and $7.0 million, respectively.

We received $230.2 million in fiscal 2002
and used $113.2 million in fiscal 2001 from financing
activities. The increase in fiscal 2002 was primarily from the
decrease in restricted cash (see “ Commitments and
Contingencies” Note 4 to Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements) partially offset by decreased
proceeds from the sale of common stock. The decrease in cash
provided by sales of common stock for fiscal 2002, compared to
the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily
due to lower stock option exercise proceeds as a result of the
decline in our stock price.

Our capital and liquidity requirements depend on
numerous factors, including risks relating to fluctuating
operating results, continued growth in the network storage and
content delivery markets, customer and market acceptance of our
products, dependence on new products, rapid technological
change, dependence on qualified technical and sales personnel,
risk inherent in our international operations, competition,
reliance on a limited number of suppliers and contract
manufacturers, dependence on proprietary technology,
intellectual property rights, the value of our investments in
equity securities and real estate, and other factors. We believe
that our existing liquidity and capital resources are sufficient
to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.

Contractual Obligations

The following summarizes our contractual
obligations at April 30, 2002, and the effect such
obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow
in future periods, (in thousands):



Item 7a.

Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to
fluctuations in interest rates, market prices and foreign
currency exchange rates. We use certain derivative financial
instruments to manage these risks. We do not use derivative
financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All
financial instruments are used in accordance with board-approved
policies.

Market Interest and Interest Income
Risk

Interest and Investment
Income —

As of
April 30, 2002, we had short-term investments of
$243.4 million. Our investment portfolio primarily consists
of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the
date of purchase of greater than three months which are
classified as available-for-sale, and investment in marketable
equity securities in certain technology companies. These highly
liquid investments, consisting primarily of government and
corporate debt securities, are subject to interest rate and
interest income risk and will decrease in value if market
interest rates increase. A hypothetical 10 percent increase
in market interest rates from levels at April 30, 2002,
would cause the fair value of these short-term investments to
decline by approximately $0.5 million. Because we have the
ability to hold these investments until maturity we would not
expect any significant decline in value of our investments
caused by market interest rate changes. Declines in interest
rates over time will, however, reduce our interest income. We do
not use derivative financial instruments in our investment
portfolio.

Market Price Risk

Equity Securities —

We are also exposed to market price
risk on our equity security included in our short-term
investments. Such investment is in a publicly traded company in
the volatile high-technology industry sector. We do not attempt
to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on this security and,
as a result, the amount of income and cash flow that we
ultimately realize from this investment in future periods may
vary materially from the current unrealized amount. A 50%
adverse change in the equity price would result in an
approximate $0.3 million decrease in the fair value of our
equity security as of April 30, 2002.

The hypothetical changes and assumptions
discussed above will be different from what actually occurs in
the future. Furthermore, such computations do not anticipate
actions that may be taken by management, should the hypothetical
market changes actually occur over time. As a result, the effect
on actual earnings in the future will differ from those
described above.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We hedge risks associated with foreign currency
transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in
foreign currency exchange rates on earnings. We utilize forward
contracts to hedge against the short-term impact of foreign
currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies. All hedge instruments are
marked to market through earnings every period. We believe that
these forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk due to
foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these
contracts are offset by losses and gains on the underlying
assets and liabilities.

All contracts have a maturity of less than one
year and we do not defer any gains and losses, as they are all
accounted for through earnings every period.

The following table provides information about
our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding on
April 30, 2002, (in thousands):

Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Stockholders of

Network Appliance, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Network Appliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries
(the “Company”) as of April 30, 2002 and 2001,
and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
April 30, 2002. Our audits also included the consolidated
financial statement schedule listed in Item 14(a)(2). These
financial statements and the financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
statements and the financial statement schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Network Appliance, Inc. and its
subsidiaries as of April 30, 2002 and 2001, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended April 30, 2002 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also, in our opinion, the consolidated financial
statement schedule listed in Item 14(a)(2), when considered
in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

2.     Significant
Accounting Policies

Fiscal
Year

— We operate on a
52-week or 53-week year ending on the last Friday in April. For
presentation purposes we have indicated in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements that our fiscal year end is
April 30. Fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 were 52-week fiscal
years.

Basis of
Presentation

— The
consolidated financial statements include the company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts
from prior years have been reclassified to conform to
current-year presentation. These reclassifications did not
change previously reported total assets, liabilities,
stockholders’ equity or net income.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

— We consider
all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Short-Term
Investments

— Our short-term
investments consist primarily of securities with original
maturities ranging between three and twelve months. All of our
investments are classified as available-for-sale, which are
carried at fair market value, and unrealized gains or losses
recorded in cumulative other comprehensive loss, which is a
separate component of stockholders’ equity, net of taxes.
Any gains or losses on sales of investments are computed based
upon specific identification. For all periods presented,
realized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments were
not material. Management determines the appropriate
classification of debt and equity securities at the time of
purchase and reevaluates the classification at each reporting
date. Available-for-sale investments are reviewed for evidence
of reductions in market value that are other than temporary. We
perform periodic reviews of our investments for impairment. Our
investments in publicly held companies are generally considered
impaired when a decline in the fair value of an investment as
measured by quoted market prices is less than its carrying value
and such a decline is not considered temporary. During fiscal
2002, we recorded a noncash, other-than-temporary write-down of
$3,641 related to an impairment of our investment in a publicly
traded company. No write-downs were recorded during fiscal 2001
and 2000.

Approximately $193,747 of our investment
portfolio at April 30, 2001 was invested in a certificate
of deposit and was restricted to collateralize our operating
leases and classified as noncurrent restricted cash. During
fiscal 2002, we discontinued our operating leases by purchasing
the land and buildings at our Sunnyvale headquarters site,
converting restricted investments to property and equipment on
the balance sheet.

Investments in Nonpublic
Companies

— We have certain
investments in nonpublicly traded companies in which we have
less than 20% of the voting rights and in which we do not
exercise significant influence. As of April 30, 2002 and
2001, $1,724 and $10,084 of these investments are included in
other long-term assets on the balance sheet and are carried at
cost. We perform periodic reviews of our investments for
impairment. Our investments in privately held companies are
considered impaired when a review of the investees’
operations and other indicators of impairment indicate that the
carrying value of the investment is not likely to be



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data)

recoverable. Such indicators include, but are not
limited to, limited capital resources, limited prospects of
receiving additional financing, and limited prospects for
liquidity of the related securities. During fiscal 2002, we
recorded a noncash, other-than-temporary write-down of $9,367
related to impairments of our investments in private companies.
No write-downs were recorded during fiscal 2001 and 2000.

Inventories

—
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out
basis) or market.

Property and
Equipment

— Property and
equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, which generally range from three to five years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the
estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of
the lease. Building improvements are amortized over the
estimated lives of the assets, which generally range from ten to
forty years. Construction in progress will be amortized over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets when they are
ready for their intended use.

We review the carrying values of long-lived
assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net
book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected
future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition. The
amount of impairment loss, if any, is measured as the difference
between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the
asset.

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible
Assets

— Goodwill and
purchased intangible assets include goodwill and other
intangible assets such as existing workforce and existing
technology, which are carried at cost less accumulated
amortization. For business combinations consummated before
July 1, 2001, goodwill and existing workforce were
amortized through April 30, 2002, using the straight-line
method over an estimated useful life of three to five years.
Amortization of other purchased intangibles is computed using
the straight-line method over the expected useful life of three
to five years. We evaluate the impairment of goodwill and
purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. See Note 2 —

Recently Issued
Accounting Standards

of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Revenue Recognition and
Allowance

— We apply the
provisions of SOP 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition”
(as amended by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9) and related
interpretations to all revenue transactions. We recognize
revenue when:

Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists.

It is our customary practice to have a
purchase order prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement.

Delivery Has Occurred.

Our product is physically delivered to
our customers, generally with standard transfer terms as FOB
shipping point. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or
return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria
are achieved. If undelivered products or services exist that are
essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an
arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred.

The Fee is Fixed or Determinable.

Arrangements with payment terms
extending beyond our standard terms and condition practices are
not considered to be fixed or determinable. Revenue from such
arrangements is recognized as the fees become due and payable.

Collection is Probable.

Probability of collection is assessed
on a customer-by-customer basis. Customers are subjected to a
credit review process that evaluates the customers’
financial position and ultimately their ability to pay. If it is
determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection is
not probable based upon our review process, revenue is
recognized upon cash receipt.

For arrangements with multiple elements, we
allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based
on vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered items.
We defer the portion of the arrangement



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data)

fee equal to the fair value of the undelivered
elements until they are delivered. Vendor specific objective
evidence is based on the price charged when the element is sold
separately.

A typical arrangement includes product, software
subscription, and maintenance. Some arrangements include
training and consulting. Software subscriptions include
unspecified products upgrades and enhancements on a
when-and-if-available basis, bug fixes and patch releases, and
are included in product revenues. Service maintenance includes
contracts for technical support and hardware maintenance.
Revenue from software subscriptions and maintenance is
recognized ratably over the contractual term, generally one to
three years. Revenue from training and consulting is recognized
as the services are performed.

The following table presents the components of
revenues, stated as a percentage of total revenues:

We record reductions to revenue for estimated
sales returns at the time of shipment. These estimates are based
on historical sales returns, changes in customer demand, and
other factors. If actual future returns and allowances differ
from past experience, additional allowances may be required.

We also maintain a separate allowance for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of our customers to make required payments. We analyze
accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer solvency, current economic and
geographic trends, and changes in customer payment terms and
practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for
doubtful accounts. If the financial condition of our customers
deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to
make payments, additional allowances may be required.

Advertising
Costs

— Advertising costs
are charged to operations when incurred. Advertising expenses
for fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 were approximately $2,543, $5,258
and $2,594, respectively.

Software Development
Costs

— The costs for the
development of new software products and substantial
enhancements to existing software products are expensed as
incurred until technological feasibility has been established,
at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in
accordance with SFAS No. 86

, “Accounting for the
Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or otherwise
Marketed.”

Because we believe our current process for
developing software is essentially completed concurrently with
the establishment of technological feasibility, which occurs
upon the completion of a working model, no costs have been
capitalized for any of the periods presented. In accordance with
SOP 98-1

, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use,

the cost of
internally-developed software is capitalized and included in
property and equipment at the point at which the conceptual
formulation, design and testing of possible software project
alternatives have been completed and management authorizes and
commits to funding the project. Pilot projects and projects
where expected future economic benefits are less than probable
are not capitalized. Internally-developed software costs include
the cost of software tools and licenses used in the development
of our systems, as well as consulting costs. Completed projects
are transferred to property and equipment at cost and are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives, generally three years.

Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign
Exchange Contracts

— For
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency,
gains and losses resulting from translation of these foreign
currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded
within stockholders’ equity as part of cumulative other
comprehensive loss. For subsidiaries where the functional
currency is the U.S. dollar, gains and losses resulting from the
process of remeasuring foreign currency financial statements
into U.S. dollars are included in other income.

In fiscal 2002, we determined that the functional
currency of one of our subsidiaries had changed from the Euro to
the U.S. Dollar. Accordingly, all monetary assets and
liabilities were translated at the current exchange rate in
effect as of the balance sheet date, nonmonetary assets and
liabilities were translated at historical rates, and total
revenues and expenses were translated at average exchange rates
in effect during the period. Transaction gains and losses are
included in other income (expense) in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.

We utilize forward exchange contracts to hedge
against the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations
on certain assets or liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies. The gains or losses on these contracts are included
in income as the exchange rates change. Management believes that
these forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk due to
foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these
contracts are offset by losses and gains on the underlying
assets and transactions being hedged.

Derivative
Instruments

— On May 1,
2001, we adopted SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. The adoption of this
accounting standard did not have a significant impact on our
financial position, results of operations, or cash flow.

As a result of our significant international
operations, we are subject to risks associated with fluctuating
exchange rates. We use foreign currency forward contracts to
attempt to minimize the impact of exchange rate movements on our
balance sheet relating to certain foreign currency assets and
liabilities. Gains and losses on these undesignated derivatives
offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being
hedged, and the net amount is included in earnings. In fiscal
2002, net gains generated by hedged assets and liabilities
totaled $1,684, which were offset by losses on the related
derivative instruments of $3,485. In fiscal 2001, net losses
generated by hedged assets and liabilities totaled $2,250, which
were offset by gains on the related derivative instruments of
$3,898. In fiscal 2000, net losses generated by hedged assets
and liabilities totaled $2,745, which were offset by gains on
the related derivative instruments of $1,102. We do not enter
into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading
purposes. Currently, we do not enter into any foreign exchange
forward contracts to hedge exposures related to forecasted
transactions, firm commitments or equity investments.

Use of
Estimates

— The preparation
of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America requires management to establish
accounting policies which contain estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Concentration of Credit
Risk

— Financial instruments
which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk
consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments,
and accounts receivable. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments consist primarily of U.S. government agencies,
corporate bonds, U.S. commercial paper, municipal securities,
cash accounts held at various banks, and money market funds held
at several financial institutions. We sell our products
primarily to large organizations in different industries and
geographies. Credit risk is mitigated by our credit evaluation
process and limited payment terms. We do not require collateral
or other security to support accounts receivable. In addition,
we maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. In
entering into forward foreign exchange contracts, we have
assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of
counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data)

counterparties to these contracts are major
multinational commercial banks, and we do not expect any losses
as a result of counterparty defaults.

Comprehensive
Income

— Comprehensive
income for the years ending April 30, 2002, 2001, and 2000
has been disclosed within the consolidated statement of
stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income.

Net Income per
Share

— Basic net income per
share is computed by dividing income available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for that period. Diluted net income per share is
computed giving effect to all dilutive potential shares that
were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common
shares consist of incremental common shares subject to
repurchase and common shares issuable upon exercise of stock
options.

The following is a reconciliation of the
numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income
per share computations for the periods presented:

At April 30, 2002, 2001, and 2000, 30,991,
18,005, and 537 shares of common stock options with a weighted
average exercise price of $40.17, $59.45, and $95.00
respectively, were excluded from the diluted net income per
share computation, as their exercise prices were greater than
the average market price of the common shares for the periods.

Statements of Cash Flows —

Supplemental cash flow and noncash
investing and financing activities are as follows:



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data)

Stock-Based
Compensation

— We record
stock compensation in accordance with provisions of APB
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and all of its interpretations for employee
awards, and in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” for non-employee awards. Accordingly, we
recognize the intrinsic value for employees and the fair value
for non-employees as stock compensation expense over the vesting
terms of the awards.

Recently Issued Accounting
Standards —

In June 2001,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations,” and SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.” Under SFAS No. 141, all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 must be
accounted for using the purchase method. Under SFAS
No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for
impairment (or more frequently if indicators of impairment
arise). Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have
indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful
lives (but with no maximum life). The amortization provisions of
SFAS No. 142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets
acquired after June 30, 2001. With respect to goodwill and
intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, we are
required to adopt SFAS No. 142 effective May 1, 2002.
Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, we will stop the
amortization of goodwill (including acquired existing workforce)
with a net carrying value of approximately $49,779 at
April 30, 2002 and the annual amortization of $15,177 that
resulted from business combinations initiated prior to the
adoption. We will evaluate goodwill under the SFAS No. 142
transitional impairment test. Any transitional impairment loss
will be recognized as a change in accounting principle on the
date of adoption. We have not determined whether adoption of
SFAS No. 142 will have an impact on our financial position,
results of operations, and cash flow.

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets,” which addresses financial accounting
and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
assets. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121,
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Assets to Be Disposed Of.” Adoption of SFAS No. 144 is
required for our fiscal year beginning May 1, 2002. We are
currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption of SFAS
No. 144 on our financial position and results of operations
and have not yet determined the impact of adopting this
statement.

4.     Commitments
and Contingencies

In fiscal 2002 we terminated our operating lease
obligations for our Sunnyvale headquarters site by purchasing
the land and buildings for $249.8 million. As a result of
headcount reductions in fiscal 2002, we are not currently
utilizing certain existing spaces at our California headquarters
site. Additionally, we have also exited office spaces under
non-cancellable leases in other locations both in the United
States and Europe. If we are unable to successfully sublease our
vacated and unoccupied office spaces under operating leases, our
operating results may be adversely affected. See Note 12
Restructuring Charges.

We lease other sales offices and research and
development facilities throughout the United States and
internationally. These sales offices are also leased under
operating leases which expire through fiscal 2019. We are
responsible for certain maintenance costs, taxes, and insurance
under these leases. The aggregate annual minimum rent commitment
under our operating leases is included in the minimum annual
lease payments schedule below.

Future minimum annual lease payments as of
April 30, 2002, are as follows:

Rent expense was $18,150, $18,090, and $7,779 for
the years ended April 30, 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively. Rent expense under certain of our facility leases
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease. The difference between the amounts paid and the amounts
expensed is classified as long-term obligations in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

We have entered into agreements and established
Network Appliance accounts with Deutsche Banc Alex.Brown whereby
we have the option to guarantee any defaults of certain margin
loans made to two corporate officers by the financial
institution on their Network Appliance stock. We have also
entered into an agreement and established a Network Appliance
account with Goldman, Sachs and Co. whereby we have the option
to guarantee any default of certain margin loan made to a third
corporate officer by the financial

institution on his Network Appliance stock. The
amount of the guarantee is limited to the excess, if any, of the
amount of such loans over the fair market value of the Network
Appliance stock securing the loans. As of April 30, 2002,
there was no such amount.

In May 2000, we entered into a split dollar
insurance arrangement with our CEO. Under the arrangement, we
will pay the annual premiums on several insurance policies on
the life of the survivor of our CEO and his wife, and our CEO
will reimburse us each year for a portion of those premiums
equal to the economic value of the term insurance coverage
provided him under the policies. For each of the 2001 and 2002
fiscal years, we paid an aggregate net annual premium on these
split dollar polices in the amount of $2,050. Under the
arrangement, we will be reimbursed for all premium payments made
on those policies, and it its intended that we will be
reimbursed not later than May 2005. Upon the death of both our
CEO and his wife or any earlier cash-out of the policies, we
will be entitled to a refund of all cumulative premiums paid on
these policies by us, and the balance will be paid to our CEO or
his designated beneficiaries. The arrangement is terminable by
us upon thirty (30)-days prior notice, and such termination
will trigger a refund of the net cumulative premiums paid by us
on the policies.

From time to time, we have committed to purchase
various key components used in the manufacture of our products.
Our loss accrual for such commitments to these key component
vendors are based on our current forecasts of inventory usage.
We establish accruals for estimated losses on purchased
components for which we believe it is probable that they will
not be utilized in future operations. To the extent that such
forecasts are not achieved, our commitments and associated
accruals may change.

We are subject to various legal proceedings and
claims which may arise in the normal course of business. We do
not believe that any current litigation or claims will have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or
financial condition.

5.     Line of
Credit

In July 1998, we negotiated a
$5,000 unsecured revolving credit facility with a domestic
commercial bank. Under terms of the credit facility, which
expires in October 2002, we must maintain various financial
covenants. Any borrowings under this agreement bear interest at
either LIBOR plus 1% or at the lender’s “prime”
lending rate, such rate determined at our discretion. There were
no amounts outstanding under this line of credit at
April 30, 2002 or 2001.

We also have foreign exchange facilities used for
hedging arrangements with several banks that allow us to enter
into foreign exchange contracts of up to $135,000, of which
$44,397 was available at April 30, 2002.

6.     Stockholders’
Equity

Stock
Splits —

On
December 20, 1999 and March 22, 2000, we effected
two-for-one stock splits of the outstanding shares of common
stock. All share and per share amounts in these consolidated
financial statements have been adjusted to give effect to the
stock splits.

Preferred
Stock

— Our Board of
Directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000 shares of
preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences,
privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, of those
shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders.

Stock Option
Plans

— We adopted the
1993 Stock Option/ Stock Issuance Plan (the “1993
Plan”) in April 1993. In September 1995, we
adopted the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan (the “1995
Plan”). The 1995 Plan replaced the 1993 Plan, and provides
for the grant of options and the issuance of common stock under
terms substantially the same as those provided under the
1993 Plan, except that the 1995 Plan does not allow
for the



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data)

exercise of options prior to vesting.
Accordingly, all options and shares issued under the
1993 Plan were incorporated into the 1995 Plan upon
the effectiveness of our initial public offering.

Under the 1995 Plan, the board of directors may
grant to employees, directors and consultants options to
purchase shares of our common stock. The exercise price for an
incentive stock option and a nonqualified stock option cannot be
less than 100% and 85%, respectively, of the fair market value
of our common stock as determined by the board of directors on
the date of grant. Options granted under the 1995 Plan generally
vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting
commencement date and then ratably over the following
36 months. Options expire as determined by the board of
directors, but not more than ten years after the date of grant.

In April 1997, the board of directors adopted the
Special Nonofficer Stock Option Plan (the “Nonofficer
Plan”) which provides for the grant of options and the
issuance of common stock under terms substantially the same as
those provided under the 1995 Plan, except that the
Nonofficer Plan allows only for the issuance of nonqualified
options to nonofficer employees.

In August 1999, the board of directors adopted
the 1999 Stock Option Plan (the “1999 Plan”), which is
comprised of two separate equity incentive programs:
(i) the Discretionary Option Grant Program under which
options may be granted to eligible individuals during the
service period at a fixed price per share and (ii) the
Automatic Option Grant Program under which nonemployee board
members will automatically receive special option grants at
designated intervals over their period of board service.

The 1999 Plan will supplement the existing 1995
Plan and Nonofficer Plan and those plans will continue to remain
in full force and effect until all available shares have been
issued under each such plan. However, the Automatic Option Grant
Program previously in effect under the 1995 Plan terminated as
of October 26, 1999, and all automatic option grants made
to nonemployee board members on or after that date will be made
under the 1999 Plan.

Under the 1999 Plan, the board of directors may
grant to employees, directors and consultants and other
independent advisors options to purchase shares of our common
stock during their period of service with us. The exercise price
for an incentive stock option and a nonstatutory option cannot
be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock
on the grant date. Options granted under the 1999 Plan generally
vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting
commencement date and then ratably over the following
36 months. Options will have a term of ten years after the
date of grant, subject to earlier termination upon the
occurrence of certain events. In fiscal 2002, the 1999 plan
was amended to increase the share reserve by an additional
13,400 shares of common stock and effect certain changes to the
Automatic Option Grant Program in effect for the nonemployee
members of the board of directors.

Options granted under the 1999 Plan are subject
to the cancellation/regrant program with the following
limitations: (i) only options held by employees who are
neither executive officers nor members of the board can be
repriced; and (ii) the total number of repriced options
will not exceed ten percent of the total number of shares of
common stock authorized for issuance under the 1999 Plan.

In fiscal 2001, we assumed various stock option
plans in connection with our Orca and WebManage acquisitions.
Pursuant to the provisions of the merger agreements, outstanding
shares were exchanged under certain exchange ratios in effect at
the time of merger. Options granted under these plans generally
vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting
commencement date and then ratably over the following
36 months. Options expire as determined by the board of
directors, but not more than ten years after the date of
grant.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

— Under the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), employees are entitled
to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the fair market
value at certain specified dates. In fiscal 2002, the plan was
amended to increase the share reserve by an additional 3,000
shares of common stock and extend the term of the ESPP to the
last business day of May, 2011. Of the 11,200 shares authorized
to be

issued under this plan, 4,171 shares were
available for issuance at April 30, 2002, and 1,094, 448,
and 1,473 shares were issued in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively, at a weighted average price of $14.60, $27.96, and
$3.87, respectively.

Pro Forma
Information

— As discussed
in Note 2, we continue to account for our stock-based awards
using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” and its related interpretations. Accordingly, no
compensation expense has been recognized in the financial
statements for employee stock arrangements with the exception of
$7,202, $6,223, and $1,345 in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively, which consists of the amortization of deferred
stock compensation related to the granting of nonqualified stock
options at exercise prices below market, the recognition of
stock compensation of unvested options assumed in the WebManage
acquisition, and the issue of contingently issuable milestone
shares.

Our calculations are based on a multiple option
valuation approach, and forfeitures are recognized as they
occur. Pro forma information under SFAS 123 is as follows:

The fair value of each option grant is estimated
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model, and is not subject to revaluation as a result of
subsequent stock price fluctuations. The following
weighted-average assumptions are used:

The Black-Scholes option pricing model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, option pricing models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. We use projected volatility rates, which are based
upon historical volatility rates since initial public offering,
trended into future years. Because our employee stock options
have characteristics significantly different from those of
traded options, and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management’s opinion the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our
options.

Deferred Stock
Compensation

— We recorded
$1,301, $14,127, and $1,845 of deferred compensation in fiscal
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, primarily related to the
recognition of stock compensation of unvested options assumed in
the WebManage acquisition, and the grant of stock options to
certain highly compensated employees. We reversed $5,381, $34,
and $40 of deferred compensation in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively due to employee terminations. The reversal in
fiscal 2002 primarily related to the forfeiture of unvested
options assumed in the WebManage acquisition as a result of
employee terminations.



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data)

Under terms of the 1995 Stock Option Plan, highly
compensated employees as defined by our management are eligible
to contribute between $15 and $75 in annual salary for the
rights to be granted nonqualified stock options. The discount
from fair market value, which is equal to the amount of salary
contributed, has been recorded as deferred compensation expense.
The deferred compensation expense is amortized ratably over a
one-year period.

In fiscal 2001, under terms of the acquisition
agreement with WebManage, we issued an additional
101 shares of common stock to former WebManage stockholders
upon meeting certain performance criteria. The fair market value
of the shares of $3,000 was measured on the date the performance
criteria were met and was recognized as stock compensation.

In fiscal 2002, under terms of the acquisition
agreement with Orca, we released an additional 165 shares of
common stock to former Orca stockholders upon meeting certain
performance criteria. The fair market value of the shares of
$3,015 was measured on the date the performance criteria were
met and was recognized as stock compensation.

In fiscal 2002, we issued an option grant of
100,000 shares of common stock under the 1999 Plan to a
nonemployee board member with an exercise price of $15.72 per
share, the fair market value per share on the grant date, in
recognition for services performed outside of the normal
capacity of a board member. The option has a term of
10 years measured from the grant date, subject to earlier
termination following his cessation of board service, and will
vest in a series of 48 successive equal monthly
installments upon his completion of each month of board service
over the 48 month period measured from the grant date.

7.     Income
Taxes

Income before income taxes is as follows:

The provision for income taxes consists of the
following:



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data)

The provision for income taxes differs from the
amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax
rate as follows:

The income tax benefits associated with
disposition from employee stock transactions of $4,952, $65,062,
and $56,248, respectively, for fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, were
recognized as additional paid in capital.

The components of our deferred tax assets and
liabilities are as follows:

Current net deferred tax assets are $32,529 and
$36,287, as of fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. Non-current
net deferred tax assets for fiscal 2002 and 2001 are $16,383 and
$10,043, respectively, and are included in other assets within
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

As of fiscal 2002, the federal and state net
operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were
approximately $832,681 and $160,687, respectively. The federal
net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal
2011, and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin
to expire in fiscal 2006. As of



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data)

fiscal 2002, we had federal and state credit
carryforwards of approximately $34,406 and $31,602,
respectively, available to offset future taxable income. These
federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2013
and the state credits will begin to expire in fiscal 2008.

We have provided a valuation allowance on certain
of our deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding
their realizability due to expectation of future employee stock
option exercises. Deferred tax assets of approximately $367,613
and $330,860 at the end of fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively,
pertain to certain tax credits and net operating loss
carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock
options. If recognized, the tax benefit of these credits and
losses will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders’
equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision.

8.     Segment,
Geographic and Customer Information

Under SFAS 131, “Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” we
operate in one reportable industry segment: the design,
manufacturing, marketing and technical support of
high-performance networked storage solutions. We market our
products in the United States and in foreign countries through
our sales personnel and our subsidiaries. The Chief Executive
Officer is our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), as defined
by SFAS 131. The CODM evaluates resource allocation
decisions and operational performance based upon revenue by
geographic regions of the segment. Under paragraph 17 of
SFAS No. 131, we have one reportable segment as all the
geographic operating segments identified can be aggregated into
one reportable segment. For the years ended April 30, 2002,
2001 and 2000, we recorded revenue from customers throughout the
United States and Canada; Europe; Latin America, Australia and
Asia Pacific.

The following presents total revenues for the
years ended April 30, 2002, 2001, and 2000 by geographic
area and long-lived assets as of April 30, 2002 and 2001 by
geographic area.

Total revenues above are attributed to regions
based on the customers’ shipment locations.

International sales include export sales
primarily to the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, France, Israel,
the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Canada and Australia. No
single foreign country accounted for 10% or more of total
revenues in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000.

No customer accounted for 10% or more of total
revenues in fiscal 2002, 2001, or 2000.

9.     Fair Value of
Financial Instruments

The following summary disclosures are made in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 107,
“Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial
Instruments”, which requires the disclosure of fair value
information about both on-and off-balance sheet financial
instruments where it is practicable to estimate the



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data)

value. Fair value is defined in SFAS 107 as
the amount at which an instrument could be exchanged in a
current transaction between willing parties, other than in a
forced or liquidation sale. Because SFAS 107 excludes
certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments
from its disclosure requirements, any aggregation of the fair
value amounts presented would not represent the underlying value
of the Company. Amounts at April 30 consist of:

We do not use derivative financial instruments
for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into forward
foreign exchange contracts to hedge trade and intercompany
receivables and payables against future movement in foreign
exchange rates. All hedge contracts are marked to market through
earnings every period.

The forward foreign exchange contracts require us
to exchange foreign currencies for U.S. dollars or vice
versa and generally mature in one month or less. As of
April 30, 2002, we had $90,459 of outstanding foreign
exchange contracts in Australian Dollars, British Pounds, Swiss
Francs and European Currency Units, that had remaining
maturities of one month or less. As of April 30, 2001, we
had $81,944 of outstanding foreign exchange contracts in British
Pounds, Swiss Francs and European Currency Units, that had
remaining maturities of one month or less. These foreign
exchange contracts are adjusted to the fair value at the end of
every month and are included in other income (expense), net.
Gains and losses on these foreign exchange contracts are offset
by losses and gains on the underlying assets and liabilities. At
April 30, 2002 and 2001, the estimated fair values of
forward foreign exchange contracts were $90,603 and $82,385,
respectively. Unrealized gains or losses on foreign exchange
contracts were not significant at April 30, 2002. The fair
value of foreign exchange contracts is based on prevailing
financial market information. Other than foreign exchange
contracts, we have not entered into any other material financial
derivative instruments.

Approximately $193,747 of our investment
portfolio at April 30, 2001 was invested in a certificate
of deposit and was restricted to collateralize our operating
leases and classified as non-current restricted cash. In fiscal
2002, the restricted investments were converted to property and
equipment on the balance sheet as we discontinued our operating
leases by purchasing the land and buildings at our Sunnyvale,
California headquarters site.

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments and restricted cash reported in the
consolidated balance sheets approximate their carrying value.
The fair value of short-term investments and foreign exchange
contracts is based on quoted market prices. Other investments in
equity securities comprise investments in companies in the
volatile high-technology market.

10.     Employee
Benefit Plan

We have established a 401(k) tax-deferred savings
plan (“Savings Plan”). Employees meeting the
eligibility requirements, as defined, may contribute specified
percentages of their salaries. We contributed $1,235, $1,109,
and $611 for fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

11.     Acquisitions

In June 2000, we completed the acquisition of
Orca, a Waltham, Massachusetts-based developer of high
performance Virtual Interface (VI) Architecture software
for enterprise-class UNIX and Windows systems. The acquisition
fits with our strategy of developing highly available and
reliable intelligent storage solutions that improve the
performance of today’s Internet and enterprise applications
and strengthen our ability to develop next generation storage
networking architectures and protocols. The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase. Under terms of the agreement, we
acquired Orca for $50,037 in common stock, assumed options and
cash, with an obligation to provide 264 shares of common
stock, which will result in additional stock compensation
charges if certain performance criteria are achieved. Certain
performance criteria were met and as such, 165 shares of common
stock were issued and recorded during fiscal 2002. The fair
market value of such shares of $3,015 was measured on the date
the performance criteria were met and was recognized as stock
compensation. The remaining 99 shares of contingently issuable
common stock will be issued if certain performance criteria are
achieved. We also paid certain transaction costs and assumed
certain operating assets and liabilities.

The purchase price of the transaction was
allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their
estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition.
Approximately $26,688 was allocated to in-process research and
development and charged to operations because the acquired
technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative uses. The value was determined by estimating the
costs to develop the acquired in-process technology into
commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash
flows from such projects, and discounting the net cash flows
back to their present value. The discount rate included a factor
that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the
successful development of the acquired in-process technology.
These estimates are subject to change, given the uncertainties
of the development process, and no assurance can be given that
deviations from these estimates will not occur. Excluding the
charge that may result from 264 contingently issuable
common shares, research and development costs to bring the
products from Orca to technological feasibility are not expected
to have a material impact on our future results of operations or
financial condition. Costs incurred prior to establishment of
technological feasibility are charged to research and
development expense and have not been material through
April 30, 2002. The Orca acquisition has been successfully
utilized for the design and development of the DAFS protocol. By
eliminating much of the traditional operating system overhead,
DAFS allows for improved I/ O performance while using fewer CPU
cycles. The protocol leverages next generation networking
technologies that provide remote memory transfer capabilities,
including RDMA implemented in VI and Infiniband. The DAFS
protocol has good industry support and is now under
consideration as an industry standard. We introduced DAFS
capable product in April 2002.

In November 2000, we completed the acquisition of
WebManage, a Chelmsford, Massachusetts-based software developer
of content management, distribution, and analysis solutions.
WebManage develops software that intelligently distributes
content between various points on the Internet and enables
organizations to plan, manage and deliver Internet/intranet
services. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. Under
terms of the agreement, we acquired WebManage for $59,371 in
common stock, assumed options, and cash. We also had an
obligation to provide shares of common stock to be valued at
$3,000 if certain performance criteria were achieved. The
performance criteria were met in March 2001 and as such, the
contingent consideration has been recorded as stock compensation
in the fourth quarter of 2001. We also paid certain transaction
costs and assumed certain operating assets and liabilities.

liabilities acquired (including purchased in-process technology)
are summarized as follows

(in thousands):

Total Purchase Price:

In accordance with FASB interpretation
No. 44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions involving
Stock Compensation,” we recorded the intrinsic value,
measured as the difference between the grant price and fair
market value on the acquisition consummation date, of unvested
options assumed in the WebManage acquisition as deferred stock
compensation. Such deferred stock compensation, which aggregated
$12,304, is recorded as a separate component of
stockholders’ equity in the accompanying condensed
consolidated balance sheet and will be amortized over the
vesting term of the related options.

The operating results of Orca and WebManage have
been included in the condensed consolidated statements of
operations since their acquisition dates. The following
unaudited pro forma consolidated amounts give effect to these
acquisitions as if they had occurred on April 30, 1999 by
consolidating the results of operations of the acquired entities
with our results for the years ended April 30, 2001 and
April 30, 2000.

The pro-forma results of operations give effect
to certain adjustments, including amortization of purchased
intangibles, goodwill, contingently issuable shares, common
stock, and assumed options in connection with the acquisitions.
The $26,688 charge for purchased in-process research and
development has been excluded from the pro-forma results, as it
is a material nonrecurring charge.

12.     Restructuring
Charges

Fiscal 2002 Second Quarter
Restructuring Plan:

In August 2001, we implemented a restructuring
plan, which included a reduction in workforce by approximately
200 employees and a consolidation of facilities. The action was
required to properly align and manage the business commensurate
with our then current revenue levels. All functional areas of
the Company were affected by the reduction. We completed our
actions during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result of
this restructuring, we incurred a charge of $7,980. The
restructuring charge included $4,796 of severance-related
amounts, $2,656 of committed excess facilities and facility
closure expenses, and $528 in fixed assets write-offs.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we
purchased our Sunnyvale headquarters site and terminated the
operating leases. As a result, an adjustment was made to reduce
the previously recorded estimated facilities lease losses by
$1,509.

The following analysis sets forth the significant
components of the restructuring reserve at April 30, 2002:

Fiscal 2002 Fourth Quarter
Restructuring Plan:

In April 2002, we announced and substantially
completed a restructuring related to the closure of an
engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the
Sunnyvale headquarters, which included a headcount reduction of
34 employees. As a result of this restructuring, we
incurred a charge of $5,850. The restructuring charge included
$813 of severance-related amounts, $4,564 of committed excess
facilities and facility closure expenses, and $473 in fixed
assets write-off.

The following analysis sets forth the significant
components of the restructuring reserve at April 30, 2002:

Of the reserve balance at April 30, 2002,
$1,061 was included in other accrued liabilities and the
remaining $3,655 was classified as long-term obligations.
