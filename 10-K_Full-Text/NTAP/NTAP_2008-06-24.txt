and/or

short-term investments available to fund future operations and
    meet other liquidity requirements;

(45) our belief that our cash and cash equivalents,
    short-term investments, cash generated from operations, and

NetApp
    Product Families

We offer highly available, scalable and cost-effective storage
    solutions that incorporate our unified storage platform and the
    feature-rich functionality of our data and storage resource
    management software. Our solutions help improve enterprise
    productivity, performance and profitability, while providing
    investment protection and enhanced asset utilization. Our
    enterprise-class storage solutions are complemented by our
    services expertise to ensure interoperability and optimization
    in the context of the application and IT infrastructure within
    which they are deployed.

Data
    ONTAP

®

Software

Our Fabric-Attached Storage (“FAS”) and V-Series
    storage solutions are based on Data
    ONTAP

®

,
    a highly optimized, scalable and flexible operating system that
    uniquely supports any mix of storage area network
    (“SAN”), network-attached storage (“NAS”)
    and Internet protocol SAN (“IP SAN”) environments
    concurrently. This unified storage software platform integrates
    seamlessly into
    UNIX

®

,
    Linux

®

,
    Windows

®

and Web environments.



The Data ONTAP operating system provides the foundation to build
    a storage infrastructure and an enterprise-wide data fabric for
    mission-critical business applications, while lowering the total
    cost of ownership and complexity typically associated with the
    management of large-scale enterprise data centers.

Data ONTAP GX, our high-performance operating system, supports
    fully integrated, multi-node storage systems within a single
    global name space. This storage grid architecture provides the
    ability to dynamically add storage resources and transparently
    redistribute data without disruption to client systems. We are
    in the process of integrating the Data ONTAP GX functionality
    with the core Data ONTAP capabilities and will ultimately
    converge both into a single operating system.

Data
    Management Software

Our products are in use today in some of the largest data
    centers in the world. These environments require
    enterprise-class management tools. We provide management
    software to increase productivity and simplify data management.
    Such tools include:

•

FlexVol

®

technology,

which enables storage architectures to be more
    efficient and achieve higher utilization using flexible volumes
    that do not require repartitioning of physical storage space;

•

FlexClone

®

technology,

which enables true data cloning using logical
    copies that do not require additional physical storage space,
    and allows for instant replication of data volumes and data sets;

•

Deduplication technology,

which provides the ability to
    eliminate duplicate data within primary and secondary disk
    storage environments, resulting in greater efficiency and higher
    utilization of storage capacity;

•

FlexShare

tm

technology,

which directs how storage system resources
    are used to deliver an appropriate level of service for each
    application;

•

FlexCache

tm

technology,

which allows performance acceleration through
    the creation of read-only cached volumes by creating caching
    volumes on multiple storage controllers; and

•

MultiStore

®

software,

which allows partitioning of individual physical
    storage systems into multiple separate logical partitions.

Storage
    Management and Application Integration Software

Our management software family of products provides a broad
    range of storage and data management tools to simplify IT
    administration and enhance flexibility and productivity. We
    deliver differentiated products and collaborate with industry
    open standards and interfaces to deliver this value to
    customers. We have four suites of products targeted to different
    IT administrative roles: Storage Suite, Server Suite, Database
    Suite and Application Suite. The software products within these
    suites are tightly integrated with database and business
    applications software from partners such as Microsoft, Oracle,
    SAP and VMware in order to optimize the performance of those
    applications on our storage systems. Our product offering
    extends into data center automation with our recent acquisition
    of Onaro, Inc., and its SANscreen software, which provides the
    capability to monitor service levels, manage performance and
    support change management in complex enterprise SAN environments.

FAS Family

Our family of modular, scalable, highly available, unified
    networked storage systems provides seamless access to a full
    range of enterprise data for users on a variety of platforms.
    The FAS 6000, FAS 3000, FAS 2000 and FAS 200
    series of fabric-attached enterprise storage systems are
    designed to consolidate UNIX, Windows, NAS, Fibre Channel
    (“FC”), Internet Small Computer Systems Interface
    (“iSCSI”), SAN and Web data in central locations
    running over the standard connection types: Gigabit Ethernet, FC
    and parallel SCSI (for backup). Our design optimizes and
    consolidates high-performance data access for individuals in
    multi-user environments as well as for application servers and
    server clusters with dedicated access. All of our FAS systems
    are interoperable and run the highly efficient Data ONTAP
    operating system.



V-Series Family

Our V-Series is a network-based virtualization solution that
    consolidates storage arrays from different suppliers behind our
    data management interface, providing SAN and NAS access to data
    stored in heterogeneous storage arrays. With the V-Series
    solution, customers are able to: transform existing
    heterogeneous, multi-vendor storage systems into a single
    storage pool; simplify storage provisioning and management with
    Data ONTAP thin provisioning; and dramatically lower backup
    time, space and cost with Data ONTAP
    Snapshot

tm

copies. The

V-Series

is
    compatible with the FAS family of storage systems.

StoreVault

tm

StoreVault is a storage solution that leverages
    enterprise-proven ONTAP technology and optimizes it to focus on
    serving small to medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”), as
    well as larger enterprises in need of small or departmental
    storage solutions. Sold exclusively through value-added
    resellers, we believe that StoreVault is the only packaging of
    advanced enterprise storage technologies that has been
    simplified and made available for SMB use.

    that combines the Data ONTAP operating system with inexpensive
    SATA disk drives to provide cost-effective, scalable and fast
    storage for data protection and retention applications. The
    NearStore software bundle bridges the gap between primary
    storage and offline storage by providing much faster data access
    than offline storage at a cost typically much lower than primary
    storage. NearStore is ideal for

disk-to-disk

backup, business continuance, archival, compliant retention and
    content storage.

VTL
    Data Protection Systems

Our Virtual Tape Library (“VTL”) solution is a

disk-to-disk

backup appliance that appears as a tape library to a backup
    software application, but provides the superior speed and
    reliability of disk technologies. Our VTL is a high-performance,
    easily managed system that can be used in any heterogeneous
    primary storage environment. Developed specifically to address
    the requirements of backup administrators, our VTL solutions
    increase the performance and reliability of backups, simplify
    backup management and reduce storage costs in traditional data
    center tape backup infrastructures.

Security has become a critical element of data management, and
    we have taken a leading role in driving security innovation. Our
    DataFort storage security appliance provides a unified
    platform for data security and key management across NAS, IP
    SAN, FC SAN and tape backup environments. The platform combines
    wire-speed encryption, access controls, authentication and
    automated key management to provide strong security for data at
    rest, while still allowing the capability to search compliant
    data for legal discovery purposes if the need arises.

NetApp
    Global Services

Our customers demand high availability and reliability of their
    storage infrastructure to ensure the successful, ongoing
    operation of their businesses. NetApp Global Services
    (“NGS”) are designed with this in mind. We provide
    professional services, global support solutions and customer
    education and training to help customers most effectively manage
    their data. The professional services and support solutions we
    offer help our customers to resolve business problems, reduce
    costs, keep businesses up and running continuously, comply with
    regulations and policies and improve overall operational
    results. We utilize a global, integrated model to provide
    consistent service delivery and global support during every
    phase of the customer engagement, including assessment and
    analysis, planning, design, installation, implementation,
    integration, optimization, ongoing support and remote management
    and monitoring. Services and support often involve phased
    rollouts, technology transitions and migrations and other
    long-term engagements.

Principal
    Markets and Distribution Channels

We market and sell our products in numerous countries throughout
    the world, and in March 2008, we launched a global branding and
    awareness campaign to increase the visibility of NetApp in the
    broader IT market. Our diversified customer base represents a
    number of large segments and vertical markets. We focus
    primarily on the enterprise data management and storage
    solutions markets, offering an array of products from our ultra
    high-end products designed for large enterprise customers to our
    low-end products designed for SMBs. We have also expanded into
    the VTL and data encryption markets, bringing us into parts of
    the data center in which we have not previously competed. With
    our next-generation operating system, Data ONTAP GX, we offer
    storage grid architecture to high-performance computing
    environments.

We employ a multi-channel distribution strategy, selling
    products and services to end users through a direct sales force,
    value-added resellers, system integrators, original equipment
    manufacturers (“OEMs”) and distributors. In North
    America, Europe and Australia, we employ a mix of resellers and
    direct sales channels to sell to end users. In Asia, Africa and
    South America, our products are primarily sold through
    resellers, which are supported by channel sales representatives
    and technical support personnel. No single customer or
    distributor accounted for 10% or more of our net sales during
    fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006.

Seasonality

As the size of our business has grown, we have begun to see a
    seasonal decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal
    year. In addition, we also see some international seasonality,
    as sales to European customers are historically weaker during
    the summer months. Sales to the U.S. government tend to be
    seasonally stronger during our second fiscal quarter, concurrent
    with the end of the U.S. federal government’s fiscal
    year in September.

Backlog

We manufacture products based on a combination of specific order
    requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand. Orders
    are generally placed by customers on an as-needed basis.
    Products are typically shipped within one to four weeks
    following receipt of an order. In certain circumstances,
    customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty. For
    these reasons, “orders” may not constitute a firm
    backlog and may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenues.



Manufacturing
    and Supply Chain

We have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties
    located in Fremont, California; Livingston, Scotland; Shanghai,
    China; Singapore; Tao Yuan Shien, Taiwan; and Schiphol Airport,
    The Netherlands. These operations include materials procurement,
    commodity management, component engineering, test engineering,
    manufacturing engineering, product assembly, product assurance,
    quality control, final test and global logistics. We rely on a
    limited number of suppliers for materials, as well as several
    key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies
    and finished systems. We multi-source wherever possible to
    mitigate supply risk. Our strategy has been to develop close
    relationships with our suppliers, exchanging critical
    information and implementing joint quality programs. We also use
    contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies
    to improve our manufacturing redundancy. This manufacturing
    strategy minimizes capital investments and overhead expenditures
    and creates flexibility for rapid expansion. We were awarded ISO
    9001 certification on May 29, 1997 and continue to be ISO
    9001 certified. We were awarded ISO 14001 certification on
    December 8, 2004 and continue to be ISO 14001 certified.

Research
    and Development

We conduct research and development activities in various
    locations throughout the world. In fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    research and development expenses represented 13.7%, 13.7% and
    12.2% of our total revenue, respectively. These costs relate
    primarily to personnel and related costs incurred to conduct
    product development activities. Although we develop many of our
    products internally, we may acquire technology through business
    combinations or through licensing from third parties when
    appropriate. We believe that technical leadership is essential
    to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial
    resources to research and development.

Competition

In the storage market, our primary and near-line storage system
    products and our associated software portfolio compete primarily
    with storage system products and data management software from
    EMC, Hitachi Data Systems (“HDS”), HP, IBM and
    Sun Microsystems. In addition, Dell, Inc. is a competitor in the
    storage marketplace through its business arrangement with EMC,
    which allows Dell to resell EMC storage hardware and software
    products, as well as through Dell’s recent acquisition of
    EqualLogic through which Dell offers low-priced storage
    solutions. In the secondary storage market, which includes the

disk-to-disk

backup, compliance and business continuity segments, our
    solutions compete primarily against products from EMC and Sun
    Microsystems. Our VTL products also compete with traditional
    tape backup solutions in the broader data backup/recovery space.
    Additionally, a number of small, newer companies have recently
    entered the storage systems and data management software
    markets, the near-line and VTL storage markets and the
    high-performance clustered storage markets, some of which may
    become significant competitors in the future.

Customer
    Base

Our diversified customer base spans a number of large segments
    and vertical markets. Examples include: energy, financial
    services, government, high technology, Internet, life sciences
    and healthcare services, major manufacturing, media,
    entertainment, animation and video postproduction and
    telecommunications.

Proprietary
    Rights

We currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark
    laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual
    provisions, and patents to protect our proprietary rights. We
    seek to protect our software, documentation, and other written
    materials under trade secret, copyright, and patent laws, which
    afford only limited



protection. We have registered our NetApp name and logo, Network
    Appliance name and logo, Data ONTAP, DataFabric,

    SnapDrive, SnapLock, SnapManager, SnapMirror, SnapRestore,
    SnapVault, WAFL, and others as trademarks in the U.S. Other
    U.S. trademarks and some of the other U.S. registered
    trademarks are registered internationally as well. We will
    continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks
    as appropriate. We generally enter into confidentiality
    agreements with our employees, resellers, and customers. We
    currently have multiple U.S. and international patent
    applications pending and multiple U.S. patents issued.

In addition, through various licensing arrangements, we receive
    certain rights to intellectual property of others. We expect to
    maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing
    arrangements in the future, as needed and to the extent
    available on reasonable terms and conditions, to support
    continued development and sales of our products and services.
    Some of these licensing arrangements require or may require
    royalty payments and other licensing fees. The amount of these
    payments and fees may depend on various factors, including but
    not limited to: the structure of royalty payments, offsetting
    considerations, if any, and the degree of use of the licensed
    technology.

See Item 1A “Risk Factors — We are exposed
    to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

The following risk factors and other information included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties
    described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks
    and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently
    deem less significant may also impair our business operations.
    Please see page 2 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional discussion of these forward-looking statements.
    If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business,
    operating results, and financial condition could be materially
    adversely affected.

Factors
    beyond our control could cause our quarterly results to
    fluctuate, which could adversely impact our common stock
    price.

We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of
    operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be
    relied upon as indicators of future performance. Many of the
    factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to
    fluctuate significantly in the future are beyond our control and
    include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

Changes in general economic conditions and specific economic
    conditions in the computer, storage, and networking industries;

•

General decrease in global corporate spending on information
    technology leading to a decline in demand for our products;

•

A shift in federal government spending patterns;

•

The possible effects of terrorist activity and international
    conflicts, which could lead to business interruptions and
    difficulty in forecasting;

•

The level of competition in our target product markets;

•

Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers due to industry
    consolidation, which could subject us to periodic

supply-and-demand,

price rigidity, and quality issues with our components;

•

The size, timing and cancellation of significant orders;

•

Product configuration and mix;

•

The extent to which our customers renew their service and
    maintenance contracts with us;

•

Market acceptance of new products and product enhancements;

•

Announcements and introductions of, and transitions to, new
    products by us or our competitors;

•

Deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or
    product enhancements introduced by us or our competitors;



•

Changes in our pricing in response to competitive pricing
    actions;

•

Our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and
    enhancements in a timely manner;

•

Supply constraints;

•

Technological changes in our target product markets;

•

The levels of expenditure on research and development and sales
    and marketing programs;

•

Our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions;

•

Excess or inadequate facilities;

•

Disruptions resulting from new systems and processes as we
    continue to enhance and adapt our system infrastructure to
    accommodate future growth;

•

Future accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting
    policies and estimates; and

•

Seasonality; for example, as the size of our business has grown,
    we have begun to see a seasonal decline in revenues in the first
    quarter of our fiscal year. Sales to the U.S. government
    also tend to be stronger during our second fiscal quarter,
    concurrent with the end of the U.S. federal
    government’s fiscal year end in September.

In addition, sales for any future quarter may vary and
    accordingly be different from what we forecast. We manufacture
    products based on a combination of specific order requirements
    and forecasts of our customer demands. Products are typically
    shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order.
    In certain circumstances, customers may cancel or reschedule
    orders without penalty. Product sales are also difficult to
    forecast because the storage and data management market is
    rapidly evolving, and our sales cycle varies substantially from
    customer to customer.

We derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from
    orders booked in the same quarter. Bookings typically follow
    intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end
    of the quarter. If we do not achieve bookings in the latter part
    of a quarter consistent with our quarterly financial targets,
    our financial results will be adversely impacted. If revenues do
    not meet our expectations, our operating profit may be
    negatively impacted because portions of our expenses are fixed
    and difficult to reduce in a short period of time. If our
    revenues are lower than expected, our fixed expenses could
    adversely affect our net income and cash flow until revenues
    increase or until such fixed expenses are reduced to a level
    commensurate with revenues.

Due to all of the foregoing factors, it is possible that in one
    or more quarters our results may fall below our forecasts and
    the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In
    such event, the trading price of our common stock would likely
    decrease.

We
    cannot assure you that our OEM relationship with IBM will
    generate significant revenue.

In April 2005, we announced a strategic partner relationship
    with IBM. As part of the relationship, we entered into an OEM
    agreement that enables IBM to sell IBM branded solutions based
    on NetApp unified solutions, including NearStore and the
    V-Series systems, as well as associated software offerings.
    While this agreement is an element of our strategy to expand our
    reach into more customers and countries, we do not have an
    exclusive relationship with IBM, and there is no minimum
    commitment for any given period of time; therefore, we cannot
    assure you that this relationship will contribute any revenue in
    future years. In addition, we have no control over the products
    that IBM selects to sell, or its release schedule and timing of
    those products; nor do we control its pricing. In the event that
    sales through IBM increase, we may experience distribution
    channel conflicts between our direct sales force and IBM or
    among our channel partners. If we fail to minimize channel
    conflicts, our operating results and financial condition could
    be harmed. We cannot assure you that this OEM relationship will
    generate significant revenue or that this strategic partnership
    will continue to be in effect for any specific period of time.



If we
    are unable to maintain our existing relationships and develop
    new relationships with major strategic partners, our revenue may
    be impacted negatively.

An element of our strategy to increase revenue is to
    strategically partner with major third party software and
    hardware vendors that integrate our products into their products
    and also co-market our products with these vendors. We have
    significant partner relationships with database, business
    application, backup management and server virtualization
    companies, including Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Symantec and
    VMware. A number of these strategic partners are industry
    leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage
    market. There is intense competition for attractive strategic
    partners, and even if we can establish relationships with these
    partners, we cannot assure you that these partnerships will
    generate significant revenue or that the partnerships will
    continue to be in effect for any specific period of time.

We intend to continue to establish and maintain business
    relationships with technology companies to accelerate the
    development and marketing of our storage solutions. To the
    extent that we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships
    and maintaining our existing relationships, our future revenue
    and operating results could be impacted negatively. In addition,
    the loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse
    effect on our revenue and earnings.

We
    cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain existing
    resellers and attract new resellers and that channel conflicts
    will not materially adversely affect our channel relationships.
    In addition, we do not have exclusive relationships with our
    resellers and accordingly there is a risk that those resellers
    may give higher priority to products of other suppliers, which
    could materially adversely affect our operating
    results.

We market and sell our storage solutions directly through our
    worldwide sales force and indirectly through channels such as
    value-added resellers, systems integrators, distributors, OEMs,
    and strategic business partners, and we derive a significant
    portion of our revenue from these indirect channel partners. In
    fiscal 2008, our indirect channels accounted for 63.0% of our
    consolidated revenues.

In order for us to maintain our current revenue sources and
    maintain or increase our revenue, we must effectively manage our
    relationships with these indirect channel partners. To do so, we
    must attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified channel
    partners to successfully market our products. However, because
    we also sell our products directly to customers through our
    sales force, on occasion we compete with our indirect channels
    for sales of our products to our end customers, competition that
    could result in conflicts with these indirect channel partners
    and make it harder for us to attract and retain these indirect
    channel partners. At the same time, our indirect channel
    partners may offer products that are competitive to ours. In
    addition, because our reseller partners generally offer products
    from several different companies, including products of our
    competitors, these resellers may give higher priority to the
    marketing, sales, and support of our competitors’ products
    than ours. If we fail to effectively manage our relationships
    with these indirect channel partners to minimize channel
    conflict and continue to evaluate and meet our indirect sales
    partners’ needs with respect to our products, we will not
    be able to maintain or increase our revenue, which would have a
    materially adverse affect on our business, financial condition
    and results of operations. Additionally, if we do not manage
    distribution of our products and services and support
    effectively, or if our resellers’ financial condition or
    operations weaken, our revenues and gross margins could be
    adversely affected.

The
    U.S. government has contributed to our revenue growth and has
    become an important customer for us. Future revenue from the
    U.S. government is subject to shifts in government spending
    patterns. A decrease in government demand for our products, or
    an adverse outcome in an ongoing investigation by the GSA and
    the Department of Justice, could materially affect our growth
    and result in civil penalties and a loss of
    revenues.

The U.S. government has become an important customer for
    the storage market and for us; however, government demand is
    unpredictable, and there can be no assurance that we will
    maintain or grow our revenue from the U.S. government.
    Government agencies are subject to budgetary processes and
    expenditure constraints that could lead to delays or decreased
    capital expenditures in IT spending. If the government or
    individual agencies within the government reduce or shift their
    capital spending pattern, our financial results may be harmed.



Selling our products to the U.S. government also subjects
    us to certain regulatory requirements. We received a subpoena
    from the Office of Inspector General for the General Services
    Administration (“GSA”) seeking various records
    relating to GSA contracting activity by us during the period
    beginning in 1995 and ending in 2005. The subpoena is part of an
    investigation being conducted by GSA and the Department of
    Justice regarding potential violations of the False Claims Act
    in connection with our GSA contracting activity. The subpoena
    requested a range of documents including documents relating to
    our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction
    clause provisions of its GSA contracts. We are cooperating with
    the investigation and have produced documents and met with the
    Department of Justice on several occasions. Violations of the
    False Claims Act could result in the imposition of a damage
    remedy which includes treble damages plus civil penalties, and
    could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future
    government contracting, any or a combination of which could have
    a material adverse effect on our results of operations or
    financial condition.

The
    market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly
    in the past and will likely continue to do so in the
    future.

The market price for our common stock has experienced
    substantial volatility in the past, and several factors could
    cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These
    factors include but are not limited to:

•

Fluctuations in our operating results;

•

Variations between our operating results and either the guidance
    we have furnished to the public or the published expectations of
    securities analysts;

•

Fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by
    investors to be comparable to us;

•

Changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections;

•

Inquiries by the SEC, NASDAQ, law enforcement or other
    regulatory bodies;

•

Economic developments in the storage and data management market
    as a whole;

•

International conflicts and acts of terrorism;

•

Announcements of new products, applications or product
    enhancements by us or our competitors;

•

Changes in our relationships with our suppliers, customers and
    channel and strategic partners; and

•

General market conditions.

In addition, the stock market has experienced volatility that
    has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities
    of many technology companies. Additionally, certain
    macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates, the
    market climate for the technology sector and levels of corporate
    spending on IT could also have an impact on the trading price of
    our stock. As a result, the market price of our common stock may
    fluctuate significantly in the future, and any broad market
    decline, as well as our own operating results, may materially
    and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Macroeconomic conditions and an IT spending slowdown as well as
    variations in our expected operating performance may continue to
    cause volatility in our stock price. We are unable to predict
    changes in general economic conditions and whether or to what
    extent global IT spending rates will be affected. Furthermore,
    if there are future reductions in either domestic or
    international IT spending rates, or if IT spending rates do not
    increase, our revenues, operating results, and stock price may
    continue to be adversely affected.

Our
    forecasts of our revenues and earnings outlook may be inaccurate
    and could materially and adversely impact our business or our
    planned results of operations.

Our revenues are difficult to forecast. We use a
    “pipeline” system, a common industry practice, to
    forecast revenues and trends in our business. Sales personnel
    monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a
    customer will make a purchase decision, the dollar amount of the
    sale and the products or services to be sold. These estimates
    are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our
    pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a
    particular quarter or over a longer period of time, in part
    because the “conversion rate” of the pipeline into



contracts varies from customer to customer, can be difficult to
    estimate, and requires management judgment. Small deviations
    from our forecasted conversion rate may result in inaccurate
    plans and budgets and could materially and adversely impact our
    business or our planned results of operations. In particular, a
    slowdown in IT spending, weak general economic conditions or
    evolving technology can reduce the conversion rate in a
    particular quarter as our customers’ purchasing decisions
    are delayed, reduced in amount, or cancelled.

In addition, we apply the provisions of Statement of Position

97-2

and
    related interpretations to our product sales, both hardware and
    software, because our software is essential to the performance
    of our hardware. If we are unable to establish fair value for
    undelivered elements of a customer order, revenue relating to
    the entire order may be deferred until the revenue recognition
    criteria for all elements of the customer order are met. This
    could lower our net revenue in one period and increase it in
    future periods, resulting in greater variability in net revenue
    and income both on a period-to-period basis and on an actual
    versus forecast basis.

If we
    are unable to successfully implement our global brand awareness
    campaign, we may not be able to increase our customer base,
    market share, or revenue, and our operating results will be
    adversely affected.

We believe that building our global brand awareness is a key
    factor to the long term success of our business and will be
    crucial in order for us to grow our customer base, increase our
    market share, and accelerate our revenue growth. In order to
    increase this awareness, we launched a new branding campaign in
    March 2008, which includes a new company name, logo, tagline and
    new corporate messaging. We are also increasing our sales
    headcount in order to leverage our brand awareness campaign and
    build demand for our products with both new and existing
    customers. We are currently incurring, and will continue to
    incur, significant expenses as a result of these investments. If
    we are not successful in achieving our desired growth in
    revenue, customers, demand and market share, whether on the time
    line we have forecasted or at all, our operating results will be
    adversely affected.

If we
    are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to
    technological change, if our new products do not achieve market
    acceptance, if we fail to manage the transition between our new
    and old products, or if we cannot provide the expected level of
    service and support for our new products, our operating results
    could be materially and adversely affected.

Our future growth depends upon the successful development and
    introduction of new hardware and software products. Due to the
    complexity of storage subsystems and storage security appliances
    and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to
    produce new products, such products are subject to significant
    technical risks. In addition, our new products must respond to
    technological changes and evolving industry standards. If we are
    unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and
    introduce new products in a timely manner in response to
    changing market conditions or customer requirements, or if such
    products do not achieve market acceptance, our operating results
    could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, new or
    additional product introductions may also adversely affect our
    sales of existing products, which could also materially and
    adversely affect our operating results.

As new or enhanced products are introduced, we must successfully
    manage the transition from older products in order to minimize
    disruption in customers’ ordering patterns, avoid excessive
    levels of older product inventories, and ensure that enough
    supplies of new products can be delivered to meet
    customers’ demands.

As we enter new or emerging markets, we will likely increase
    demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed
    to additional competition. We may not be able to provide
    products, service and support to effectively compete for these
    market opportunities. Furthermore, provision of greater levels
    of services may result in a delay in the timing of revenue
    recognition due to the provisions of Statement of Position

No. 97-2

and related interpretations.

Our
    gross margins may vary based on the configuration of our product
    and service solutions, and such variation may make it more
    difficult to forecast our earnings.

We derive a significant portion of our sales from the resale of
    disk drives as components of our storage systems, and the resale
    market for disk drives is highly competitive and subject to
    intense pricing pressures. Our sales of disk



drives generate lower gross margin than those of our storage
    systems. As a result, as we sell more highly configured systems
    with greater disk drive content, overall gross margin may be
    negatively affected.

Our product gross margins have been and may continue to be
    affected by a variety of other factors, including:

•

Demand for storage and data management products;

•

Pricing actions, rebates, initiatives, discount levels and price
    competition;

•

Direct versus indirect and OEM sales;

•

Product and add-on software mix;

•

The mix of services as a percentage of revenue;

•

The mix and average selling prices of products;

•

The mix of disk content;

•

New product introductions and enhancements;

•

Excess inventory purchase commitments as a result of changes in
    demand forecasts and possible product and software defects as we
    transition our products; and

•

The cost of components, manufacturing labor, quality, warranty
    and freight.

Changes in service gross margins may result from various factors
    such as:

•

Continued investments in our customer support infrastructure;

•

Changes in the mix between technical support services and
    professional services; and

•

The timing of technical support service contract initiations and
    renewals.

An
    increase in competition could materially and adversely affect
    our operating results.

The storage markets are intensely competitive and are
    characterized by rapidly changing technology. In the storage
    market, our primary and nearline storage system products and our
    associated storage software portfolio compete primarily with
    storage system products and data management software from EMC,
    HDS, HP, IBM, and Sun/StorageTek. We also see Dell, Inc. as a
    competitor in the storage marketplace, primarily through its
    business partnership with EMC, which allows Dell to resell EMC
    storage hardware and software products. We have also
    historically encountered less-frequent competition from other
    companies, including LSI Logic. In the secondary storage market,
    which includes the disk-to-disk backup, compliance, and business
    continuity segments, our solutions compete primarily against
    products from EMC and Sun/StorageTek. Our NearStore VTL
    appliances also compete with traditional tape backup solutions
    in the broader data backup/recovery space. Additionally, a
    number of small, new companies are currently attempting to enter
    the storage systems and data management software markets and the
    near-line and NearStore VTL storage markets, some of which may
    become significant competitors in the future.

There has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our
    markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as
    companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions
    in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are
    unable to continue operations. We believe that industry
    consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better
    able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. In
    addition, current and potential competitors have established or
    may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with
    third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors
    or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire
    significant market share. We cannot assure you that we will be
    able to compete successfully against current or future
    competitors. Competitive pressures we face could materially and
    adversely affect our operating results.



We
    rely on a limited number of suppliers, and any disruption or
    termination of our supply arrangements could delay shipment of
    our products and could materially and adversely affect our
    operating results.

We rely on a limited number of suppliers for components such as
    disk drives, computer boards and microprocessors utilized in the
    assembly of our products. In recent years, rapid industry
    consolidation has led to fewer component suppliers, which could
    subject us to periodic supply constraints and price rigidity.

Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several
    risks, including:

•

A potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required
    components;

•

Supplier capacity constraints;

•

Price increases;

•

Timely delivery; and

•

Component quality.

Component quality risk is particularly significant with respect
    to our suppliers of disk drives. In order to meet product
    performance requirements, we must obtain disk drives of
    extremely high quality and capacity. In addition, there are
    periodic

supply-and-demand

issues for disk drives, microprocessors and semiconductor memory
    components, which could result in component shortages, selective
    supply allocations and increased prices of such components. We
    cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain our full
    requirements of such components in the future or that prices of
    such components will not increase. In addition, problems with
    respect to yield and quality of such components and timeliness
    of deliveries could occur. Disruption or termination of the
    supply of these components could delay shipments of our products
    and could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
    Such delays could also damage relationships with current and
    prospective customers and suppliers.

In addition, we license certain technology and software from
    third parties that are incorporated into our products. If we are
    unable to obtain or license the technology and software on a
    timely basis or on acceptable terms, we will not be able to
    deliver products to our customers in a timely manner.

The
    loss of any contract manufacturers or the failure to accurately
    forecast demand for our products or successfully manage our
    relationships with our contract manufacturers could negatively
    impact our ability to manufacture and sell our
    products.

We currently rely on several contract manufacturers to
    manufacture our products in multiple locations around the world.
    Our reliance on our third party contract manufacturers reduces
    our control over the manufacturing process, exposing us to
    risks, including reduced control over quality assurance,
    production costs and product supply. If we should fail to
    effectively manage our relationships with our contract
    manufacturers, or if our contract manufacturers experience
    delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control
    problems in their manufacturing operations, our ability to ship
    products to our customers could be impaired, and our competitive
    position and reputation could be harmed. Qualifying a new
    contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is
    expensive and time-consuming. If we are required to change
    contract manufacturers or bring certain manufacturing in-house,
    we may lose revenue and damage our customer relationships. If we
    inaccurately forecast demand for our products, we may have
    excess or inadequate inventory or incur cancellation charges or
    penalties, which could adversely impact our operating results.
    To date, we do not have any significant purchase commitments
    under our agreements with contract manufacturers.

We intend to regularly introduce new products and product
    enhancements, which will require us to rapidly achieve volume
    production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and
    suppliers. We may need to increase our material purchases,
    contract manufacturing capacity and quality functions to meet
    anticipated demand. The inability of our contract manufacturers
    to provide us with adequate supplies of high-quality products or
    their inability to obtain raw materials suitable for our needs
    could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders.



Our
    future financial performance depends on growth in the storage
    and data management markets. If these markets do not continue to
    grow at the rates we expect and upon which we calculate and
    forecast our growth, our operating results will be materially
    and adversely impacted.

All of our products address the storage and data management
    markets. Accordingly, our future financial performance will
    depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and data
    management markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging
    standards in these markets. We cannot assure you that the
    markets for storage and data management will continue to grow or
    that emerging standards in these markets will not adversely
    affect the growth of UNIX, Windows and the World Wide Web server
    markets upon which we depend.

For example, we provide our open access data retention solutions
    to customers within the financial services, healthcare,
    pharmaceutical and government market segments, industries that
    are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with
    respect to data access, reliability and permanence (such as
    Rule 17(a)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended) in the United States and in the other countries in
    which we operate. If our products do not meet and continue to
    comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this
    regard, customers in these market and geographical segments will
    not purchase our products, and we will not be able to expand our
    product offerings in these market and geographical segments at
    the rates for which we have forecast.

We are
    exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio
    investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments
    could harm our financial results.

At April 25, 2008, and April 27, 2007, we had
    $1,487.3 million and $1,430.7 million, respectively,
    in cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted
    cash and investments. We invest our cash in a variety of
    financial instruments, consisting principally of investments in
    corporate bonds, money market funds, corporate securities,
    municipalities and the United States government and its
    agencies, and auction rate securities. These investments are
    subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate
    risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events such as the
    sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States which has
    affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to
    global credit and liquidity issues. If the global credit market
    continues to deteriorate, our investment portfolio may be
    impacted and we could determine that some of our investments
    have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value,
    requiring an impairment charge which could adversely impact our
    financial results.

We account for our investment instruments in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
    Equity Securities

. All of the cash equivalents, marketable
    securities and restricted investments are treated as
    “available-for-sale” under SFAS No. 115.
    Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest
    earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed
    rate debt securities may have their market value adversely
    impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate
    securities may produce less income than expected if interest
    rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment
    income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest
    rates. Currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments
    in our investment portfolio. Because we have the ability and
    intent to hold our available-for-sale investments until
    maturity, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in
    interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to
    maturity. However, we may suffer losses in principal if forced
    to sell securities that have experienced a decline in market
    value because of changes in interest rates. Currently, we do not
    use financial derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure.

Funds
    associated with certain of our auction rate securities may not
    be accessible for in excess of 12 months and our auction
    rate securities may experience an other than temporary decline
    in value, which would adversely affect our
    earnings.

Auction rate securities or, ARS, held by us are securities with
    long term nominal maturities which, in accordance with
    investment policy guidelines, had credit ratings of AAA and Aaa
    at time of purchase. Interest rates for ARS are reset through a
    “Dutch auction” each month, which historically has
    provided a liquid market for these securities.

Substantially all of our ARS are backed by pools of student
    loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education, and
    we believe the credit quality of these securities is high based
    on this guarantee. However liquidity



issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of
    auctions for certain of our ARS investments, with a par value of
    $76.2 million at April 25, 2008. For each failed
    auction, the interest rate moves to a maximum rate defined for
    each security, and the ARS continue to pay interest in
    accordance with their terms, although the principal associated
    with the ARS will not be accessible until there is a successful
    auction or such time as other markets for ARS investments
    develop.

We believe that the underlying credit quality of the assets
    backing our ARS investments have not been impacted by the
    reduced liquidity of these investments. Based on an analysis of
    the fair value and marketability of these investments, we
    recorded a temporary impairment within other accumulated
    comprehensive income, an element of stockholders’ equity on
    our balance sheet, of approximately $3.5 million at
    April 25, 2008. In addition, we have classified all of our
    auction rate securities that were not liquidated before
    April 25, 2008 as long-term assets in our consolidated
    balance sheet as of April 25, 2008 as our ability to
    liquidate such securities in the next 12 months is
    uncertain. If liquidity issues in the global credit market
    continue, or worsen, or if we experience reduced credit quality,
    extended illiquidity or realize reduced valuations of our ARS
    investments, we may determine that we have experienced an
    other-than-temporary decline in fair value in these long-term
    assets, which could adversely impact our financial results.

Our
    leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our
    financial condition and results of operations.

As a result of our sale of $1.265 billion of 1.75%
    convertible senior notes in June 2008 (the “Notes”),
    we have a greater amount of long-term debt than we have
    maintained in the past. We also have two credit facilities and
    various synthetic lease arrangements. As of April 25, 2008,
    as adjusted to give effect to the issuance of the Notes as of
    such date, we would have had approximately $1.438 billion
    of long-term debt outstanding. In addition, subject to the
    restrictions in our existing and any future financings
    agreements, we may incur additional debt.

Our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have
    important consequences because:

•

It could adversely affect our ability to satisfy our obligations;

•

An increased portion of our cash flows from operations may have
    to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not
    be available for operations, working capital, capital
    expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or
    other purposes;

•

It may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the
    future;

•

It may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to,
    changes in our business and industry; and

•

It may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our
    industry or the economy in general.

Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will
    depend on our future performance, which will be affected by
    financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We
    will not be able to control many of these factors, such as
    economic conditions and governmental regulations. Our operations
    may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our
    debt. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in
    default on such debt, and this default could cause us to be in
    default on our other outstanding classes of debt.

Future
    issuances of common stock and hedging activities by holders of
    the Notes may depress the trading price of our common stock and
    the Notes.

Any issuance of equity securities after the Notes offering,
    including the issuance of shares upon conversion of the Notes,
    could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders,
    including holders who receive shares upon conversion of their
    Notes, and could substantially decrease the trading price of our
    common stock and the Notes. We may issue equity securities in
    the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our
    operations and business strategy (including in connection with
    acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions),
    to increase our capital, to adjust our ratio of debt to equity,
    to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding
    warrants or options or for other reasons.



In addition, the price of our common stock could also be
    affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who
    view the Notes as a more attractive means of equity
    participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading
    activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock by
    holders of the Notes. The hedging or arbitrage could, in turn,
    affect the trading price of the Notes, or any common stock that
    holders receive upon conversion of the Notes.

Conversion
    of our Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing
    stockholders, including holders who had previously converted
    their Notes.

The conversion of some or all of our outstanding Notes will
    dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the
    extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the Notes.
    Upon conversion, we will satisfy our conversion obligation by
    delivering cash for the principal amount of a Note and shares of
    common stock, if any, to the extent the conversion value exceeds
    the principal amount. There would be no adjustment to the
    numerator in the net income per common share computation for the
    cash settled portion of the Notes as that portion of the debt
    instrument will always be settled in cash. The number of shares
    delivered upon conversion, if any, will be included in the
    denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common
    share. Any sales in the public market of any common stock
    issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing
    market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of
    the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants
    because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy
    short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Notes into
    shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common
    stock.

The
    note hedge and warrant transactions that we entered into in
    connection with the sale of the Notes may affect the trading
    price of our common stock.

In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into
    privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with
    certain option counterparties (the “Counterparties”),
    which are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our
    common stock upon any conversion of the Notes. At the same time,
    we also entered into warrant transactions with the
    Counterparties pursuant to which we may issue shares of our
    common stock above a certain strike price. In connection with
    hedging these transactions, the Counterparties may have entered
    into various over-the-counter derivative transactions with
    respect to our common stock or purchased shares of our common
    stock in secondary market transactions at or following the
    pricing of the Notes. Such activities may have had the effect of
    increasing the price of our common stock. The Counterparties are
    likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior
    to conversion or maturity of the Notes by purchasing and selling
    shares of our common stock or entering into other derivative
    transactions. Additionally, these transactions may expose us to
    counterparty credit risk for nonperformance. We manage our
    exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum
    credit standards and the diversification of counterparties. The
    effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on
    the market price of our common stock or the Notes will depend,
    in part, on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this
    time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the
    value of our common stock.

In addition, if our stock price exceeds the strike price for the
    warrants, there could be additional dilution to our
    shareholders, which could adversely affect the value of our
    common stock.

Our
    synthetic leases are off-balance sheet arrangements that could
    negatively affect our financial condition and results. We are
    investing substantial resources in new facilities and physical
    infrastructure, which will increase our fixed costs. Our
    profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow
    proportionately to our increase in fixed costs.

We have various synthetic lease arrangements with BNP Paribas
    Leasing Corporation (the lessor) for our headquarters office
    buildings in Sunnyvale, California and a data center in Research
    Triangle Park, North Carolina. These synthetic leases qualify
    for operating lease accounting treatment under
    SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases (as amended), and
    are not considered variable interest entities under
    FIN No. 46R “Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities (revised).” Therefore, we do not include the
    properties or the associated debt on our condensed consolidated
    balance sheet. However, if circumstances were to change
    regarding our or BNP’s ownership of the properties, or in
    BNP’s overall portfolio, we could be required to
    consolidate the entity, the leased facilities and the associated
    debt.



If we elect not to purchase the properties at the end of the
    lease term, we have guaranteed a minimum residual value to BNP.
    Therefore, if the fair value of the properties declines below
    that guaranteed minimum residual value, our residual value
    guarantee would require us to pay the difference to BNP, which
    could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results
    of operations and financial condition.

We have contractual commitments related to capital expenditures
    on construction or expansion of our facilities and data center.
    We may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection
    with new facilities. These expansions will increase our fixed
    costs. If we are unable to grow our business and revenues
    proportionately to our increase in fixed costs, our
    profitability will be reduced.

We are
    subject to restrictive debt covenants pursuant to our
    indebtedness. These covenants may restrict our ability to
    finance our business and, if we do not comply with the covenants
    or otherwise default under them, we may not have the funds
    necessary to pay all amounts that could become
    due.

The agreements governing our credit facilities and synthetic
    lease arrangements contain, and any other future debt agreement
    we enter into may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our
    ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our
    ability to:

•

Incur indebtedness;

•

Incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level;

•

Grant liens;

•

Sell all or substantially all our assets:

•

Enter into certain mergers;

•

Change our business;

•

Enter into swap agreements;

•

Enter into transactions with our affiliates; and

•

Enter into certain restrictive agreements.

Our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our
    future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some
    of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic
    conditions.

As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to
    changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain
    additional financing, if needed, may be significantly
    restricted, and we may be prevented from engaging in
    transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us. In
    addition, our failure to comply with these covenants could
    result in a default under the Notes and our other debt, which
    could permit the holders to accelerate such debt. If any of our
    debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available
    to repay such debt.

Unfavorable
    economic and market conditions and global disruptions could
    adversely affect our operating results.

Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable
    global economic and market conditions as well as the uncertain
    geopolitical environment. Customer demand for our products is
    intrinsically linked to the strength of the economy. A reduction
    in demand for storage and data management caused by weakening
    economic conditions and customer decreases in corporate
    spending, deferral or delay of IT projects, longer time frames
    for IT purchasing decisions and generally reduced capital
    expenditures for IT storage solutions will result in decreased
    revenues and lower revenue growth rates for us. The network
    storage market growth declined significantly beginning in the
    third quarter of fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2003, causing both
    our revenues and operating results to decline. If the storage
    and data management markets grow more slowly than anticipated,
    or if emerging standards other than those adopted by us become
    increasingly accepted by these markets, our operating results
    could be materially and adversely affected.



Turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the
    world, including terrorist activities and military actions, may
    continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. We have
    no assurance that the consequences from these events will not
    disrupt our operations in either the U.S. or other regions
    of the world. Continued increases in energy prices, declining
    economic conditions and global credit and liquidity issues could
    also affect our future operating results. If the economic and
    market conditions in the United States and globally do not
    improve, or if they deteriorate, we may experience material
    adverse impacts on our business, operating results, and
    financial condition.

Risks
    inherent in our international operations could have a material
    adverse effect on our operating results.

We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the
    United States. A substantial portion of our revenues is derived
    from sales outside of the U.S. For example, in fiscal 2008,
    47.1% of our total revenues were from international customers
    (including U.S. exports). In addition, we have several
    research and development centers overseas, and a substantial
    portion of our products are manufactured outside of the
    U.S. Accordingly, our business and our future operating
    results could be materially and adversely affected by a variety
    of factors affecting our international operations, some of which
    are beyond our control, including regulatory, political, or
    economic conditions in a specific country or region, trade
    protection measures and other regulatory requirements,
    government spending patterns, and acts of terrorism and
    international conflicts. In addition, we may not be able to
    maintain or increase international market demand for our
    products.

We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency
    exchange rates as a result of our international operations.
    These exposures may change over time as business practices
    evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our
    financial results and cash flows. Our international sales are
    denominated in U.S. dollars and in foreign currencies. An
    increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to
    foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and
    therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets.
    Conversely, lowering our price in local currency may result in
    lower

U.S.-based

revenue. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar
    relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost of local
    operating expenses. Additionally, we have exposures to emerging
    market currencies, which can have extreme currency volatility.
    We utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our foreign
    currency exposure associated with certain assets and liabilities
    as well as anticipated foreign currency cash flows. All balance
    sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every
    quarter. The time-value component of our cash flow hedges is
    recorded in earnings while all other gains and losses are marked
    to market through other comprehensive income until forecasted
    transactions occur, at which time such realized gains and losses
    are recognized in earnings. These hedges attempt to reduce, but
    do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency
    exchange movements. Factors that could have an impact on the
    effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of
    forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets as well
    as widening interest rate differentials and the volatility of
    the foreign exchange market. There can be no assurance that such
    hedging strategies will be successful and that currency exchange
    rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our
    operating results.

Additional risks inherent in our international business
    activities generally include, among others, longer accounts
    receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing
    international operations. Such factors could materially and
    adversely affect our future international sales and consequently
    our operating results. Our international operations are subject
    to other risks, including general import/export restrictions and
    the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy,
    misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our
    intellectual property rights than U.S. law.

A
    significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents balances
    are held overseas. If we are not able to generate sufficient
    cash domestically in order to fund our U.S. operations and
    strategic opportunities and service our debt, we may incur a
    significant tax liability in order to repatriate the overseas
    cash balances, or we may need to raise additional capital in the
    future.

A portion of our earnings which is generated from our
    international operations is held and invested by certain of our
    foreign subsidiaries. These amounts are not freely available for
    dividend repatriation to the United States without triggering
    significant adverse tax consequences, which could adversely
    affect our financial results. As a result, unless the cash
    generated by our domestic operations is sufficient to fund our
    domestic operations, our broader corporate initiatives such as
    stock repurchases, acquisitions, and other strategic
    opportunities, and to



service our outstanding indebtedness, we may need to raise
    additional funds through public or private debt or equity
    financings, or we may need to expand our existing credit
    facilities to the extent we choose not to repatriate our
    overseas cash. Such additional financing may not be available on
    terms favorable to us, or at all, and any new equity financings
    or offerings would dilute our current stockholders’
    ownership. Furthermore, lenders, in particular in light of the
    current challenges in the credit markets, may not agree to
    extend us new, additional or continuing credit. If adequate
    funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable
    terms, we may be forced to repatriate our foreign cash and incur
    a significant tax expense or we may not be able to take
    advantage of strategic opportunities, develop new products,
    respond to competitive pressures or repay our outstanding
    indebtedness. In any such case, our business, operating results
    or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Our
    effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate, which could
    increase our income tax expense and reduce our net
    income.

Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several
    factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:

•

Earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are
    taxed at lower rates as compared to the U.S. statutory tax
    rate;

•

Material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates as
    a result of a shift in the mix of pretax profits and losses by
    tax jurisdiction, our ability to use tax credits, or effective
    tax rates by tax jurisdiction different than our estimates;

•

Changing tax laws, accounting standards, such as occurred with
    the introduction of SFAS No. 123R and
    FIN No. 48, regulations, and interpretations in
    multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as the
    requirements of certain tax rulings;

•

An increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes,
    including certain stock-based compensation expense, write-offs
    of acquired in-process research and development, and impairment
    of goodwill;

•

The tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and
    restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between
    reporting periods;

•

Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
    liabilities;

•

Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws;

•

Tax assessments or any related tax interest or penalties could
    significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in
    which the settlements take place; and

•

A change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign
    earnings.

We receive significant tax benefits from sales to our

non-U.S. customers.

These benefits are contingent upon existing tax regulations in
    the United States and in the countries in which our
    international operations are located. Future changes in domestic
    or international tax regulations could adversely affect our
    ability to continue to realize these tax benefits. Our
    international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling
    concluded in the Netherlands, which expires in 2010. If we are
    unable to renegotiate a similar tax ruling upon expiration of
    the current ruling, our effective tax rate could increase and
    our operating results could be adversely affected. Our effective
    tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and
    evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations, which
    in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial
    results as a whole.

The price of our common stock could decline to the extent that
    our financial results are materially affected by an adverse
    change in our effective tax rate. We are currently undergoing
    federal income tax audits in the United States and several
    foreign tax jurisdictions. The rights to some of our
    intellectual property (“IP”) are owned by certain of
    our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made between
    U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of
    this IP in a qualified cost sharing arrangement. Recently,
    several other U.S. companies have had their foreign IP
    arrangements challenged as part of IRS examinations, which has
    resulted in material proposed assessments

and/or

pending litigation. Our management does not believe, based upon
    information currently known to us, that the final resolution of
    any of our audits will have a material adverse effect upon our
    consolidated financial



position and our results of operations and cash flows. If the
    ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these tax
    jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we
    have recorded or reserved for, our operating results, cash flows
    and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We may
    face increased risks and uncertainties related to our current or
    future acquisitions and investments in nonmarketable securities
    of private companies, and these investments may not achieve our
    objectives.

As part of our strategy, we are continuously evaluating
    opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would
    complement our current products, expand the breadth of our
    markets, or enhance our technical capabilities. We may engage in
    future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders’
    investments and cause us to use cash, incur debt, or assume
    contingent liabilities.

Acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks, and we may not
    be able to successfully integrate acquired operations and
    products or to realize anticipated synergies, economies of
    scale, or other value. Integration risks and issues may include,
    but are not limited to, key personnel retention and
    assimilation, management distraction, technical development and
    unexpected costs and liabilities, including goodwill impairment
    charges. In addition, we may be unable to recover strategic
    investments in development stage entities. Any such problems
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

On occasion, we invest in nonmarketable securities of private
    companies. As of April 25, 2008, the carrying value of our
    investments in nonmarketable securities totaled
    $11.2 million. Investments in nonmarketable securities are
    inherently risky, and some of these companies are likely to
    fail. Their success (or lack thereof) is dependent on product
    development, market acceptance, operational efficiency and other
    key business success factors. In addition, depending on these
    companies’ future prospects, they may not be able to raise
    additional funds when needed, or they may receive lower
    valuations, with less favorable investment terms than in
    previous financings, and our investments in them would likely
    become impaired.

If we
    fail to manage our expanding business effectively, our operating
    results could be materially and adversely
    affected.

Our future operating results depend to a large extent on
    management’s ability to successfully manage expansion and
    growth, including but not limited to expanding international
    operations, forecasting revenues, addressing new markets,
    controlling expenses, implementing and enhancing infrastructure,
    investing in people, facilities and capital equipment and
    managing our assets. An unexpected decline in the growth rate of
    revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expense
    growth or a failure to manage other aspects of growth could
    materially and adversely affect our operating results.

In addition, continued expansion could strain our current
    management, financial, manufacturing and other existing systems
    and may require us to improve those existing systems or
    implement new ones. If we experience any problems with the
    improvement or expansion of these systems, procedures or
    controls, or if these systems, procedures or controls are not
    designed, implemented or improved in a cost-effective and timely
    manner, our operations may be materially and adversely affected.
    In addition, any failure to implement, improve and expand such
    systems, procedures and controls in a timely and efficient
    manner could harm our growth strategy and materially and
    adversely affect our financial condition and ability to achieve
    our business objectives.

As we
    continue to grow our business, we are likely to incur costs
    earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, which could harm
    our operating results. A significant percentage of our expenses
    are fixed, which could materially and adversely affect our net
    income.

We are increasing our investment in engineering, sales, service
    support and other functions to grow our business. We are likely
    to recognize the costs associated with these increased
    investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and
    the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop
    more slowly, than we expect, which could harm our business.



Our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to
    future sales, and a significant percentage of our expenses are
    fixed. As a result, if sales levels are below expectations or
    previously higher levels, net income will be affected in a
    material and adverse manner.

We
    depend on the ability of our personnel, raw materials, equipment
    and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world. Our
    business could be materially and adversely affected as a result
    of a natural disaster, terrorist acts or other catastrophic
    events.

Any political, military, world health or other issue that
    hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of
    materials could lead to significant business disruptions.
    Furthermore, any strike, economic failure or other material
    disruption caused by fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, power
    shortages, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar
    events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct
    business. If such disruptions result in cancellations of
    customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic
    activity or corporate spending on information technology, or
    directly impact our marketing, manufacturing, financial and
    logistics functions, our results of operations and financial
    condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition,
    our headquarters are located in Northern California, an area
    susceptible to earthquakes. If any significant disaster were to
    occur, our ability to operate our business could be impaired.

We
    depend on attracting and retaining qualified technical and sales
    personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain such
    personnel, our operating results could be materially and
    adversely impacted.

Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to
    identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified technical and
    sales personnel. Because our future success is dependent on our
    ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products, we
    are particularly dependent on our ability to identify, attract,
    motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite
    education, background and industry experience. Competition for
    qualified engineers, particularly in Silicon Valley, can be
    intense. The loss of the services of a significant number of our
    engineers or salespeople could be disruptive to our development
    efforts or business relationships and could materially and
    adversely affect our operating results.

Undetected
    software errors, hardware errors, or failures found in new
    products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of
    our products, which could increase our costs and reduce our
    revenues. Product quality problems could lead to reduced
    revenue, gross margins and net income.

Our products may contain undetected software errors, hardware
    errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are
    released. Despite testing by us and by current and potential
    customers, errors may not be found in new products until after
    commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of or
    delay in market acceptance, which could materially and adversely
    affect our operating results.

If we fail to remedy a product defect, we may experience a
    failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal
    from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory
    costs or product reengineering expenses, any of which could have
    a material impact on our revenue, margins and net income.

In addition, we may be subject to losses that may result or are
    alleged to result from defects in our products, which could
    subject us to claims for damages, including consequential
    damages. Based on our historical experience, we believe that the
    risk of exposure to product liability claims is currently low.
    However, should we experience increased exposure to product
    liability claims, our business could be adversely impacted.

We are
    exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims
    and protection of intellectual property rights, which could
    adversely affect our operating results.

We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business,
    including our ongoing litigation with Sun Microsystems.
    Litigation can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal
    business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal
    proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution
    of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on
    our business, operating results, or financial condition.



If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may be
    subject to increased competition that could materially and
    adversely affect our operating results. Our success depends
    significantly upon our proprietary technology. We rely on a
    combination of copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets,
    confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and patents
    to protect our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our
    software, documentation and other written materials under trade
    secret, copyright and patent laws, which afford only limited
    protection. Some of our U.S. trademarks are registered
    internationally as well. We will continue to evaluate the
    registration of additional trademarks as appropriate. We
    generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our
    employees and with our resellers, strategic partners and
    customers. We currently have multiple U.S. and
    international patent applications pending and multiple
    U.S. patents issued. The pending applications may not be
    approved, and our existing and future patents may be challenged.
    If such challenges are brought, the patents may be invalidated.
    We cannot assure you that we will develop proprietary products
    or technologies that are patentable, that any issued patent will
    provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be
    challenged by third parties, or that the patents of others will
    not materially and adversely affect our ability to do business.
    In addition, a failure to obtain and defend our trademark
    registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and
    competitive position.

Litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary
    technology. Any such litigation may be time consuming and
    costly. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,
    unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products
    or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
    In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect
    proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the
    United States. We cannot assure you that our means of protecting
    our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors
    will not independently develop similar technology, duplicate our
    products, or design around patents issued to us or other
    intellectual property rights of ours.

We are subject to intellectual property infringement claims. We
    may, from time to time, receive claims that we are infringing
    third parties’ intellectual property rights. Third parties
    may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to
    current or future products, patents, trademarks or other
    proprietary rights. We expect that companies in the network
    storage market will increasingly be subject to infringement
    claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry
    segment grows and the functionality of products in different
    industry segments overlaps. Any such claims could be time
    consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment
    delays, require us to redesign our products or to enter into
    royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could materially
    and adversely affect our operating results. Such royalty or
    licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms
    acceptable to us or at all.

Our
    business is subject to increasingly complex corporate
    governance, public disclosure, accounting and tax requirements
    that have increased both our costs and the risk of
    noncompliance.

Because our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to
    certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial
    market exchange entities charged with the protection of
    investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are
    publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC, and NASDAQ, have
    implemented requirements and regulations and continue developing
    additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate
    scandals and laws enacted by Congress, most notably the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our efforts to comply with these
    regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue
    resulting in, increased general and administrative expenses and
    diversion of management time and attention from
    revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.

We completed our evaluation of our internal controls over
    financial reporting for the fiscal year ended April 25,
    2008 as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
    of 2002. Although our assessment, testing and evaluation
    resulted in our conclusion that as of April 25, 2008, our
    internal controls over financial reporting were effective, we
    cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods. If
    our internal controls are ineffective in future periods, our
    business and reputation could be harmed. We may incur additional
    expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection
    with further evaluations, either of which could materially
    increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our net
    income.

Because new and modified laws, regulations, and standards are
    subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their
    lack of specificity, their application in practice may evolve
    over time as new guidance is provided by



regulatory and governing bodies. This evolution may result in
    continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and
    additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our
    disclosure and governance practices.

Our
    ability to forecast earnings is limited by the impact of new and
    existing accounting requirements such as
    SFAS No. 123R.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board requires companies to
    recognize the fair value of stock options and other share-based
    payment compensation to employees as compensation expense in the
    statement of income. Option pricing models require the input of
    highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock
    price volatility, expected life and forfeiture rate. We have
    chosen to base our estimate of future volatility using the
    implied volatility of traded options to purchase our common
    stock as permitted by SAB No. 107. Management applies
    judgment when determining estimated forfeiture rates. We base
    our estimates on historical experience and on various other
    assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the
    circumstances, actual results may differ significantly from
    these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and,
    as a result, could have a material impact on our financial
    position and results of operations. Given the unpredictable
    nature of the “Black Scholes” variables and other
    management assumptions such as number of options to be granted,
    underlying strike price and associated income tax impacts, it is
    very difficult to forecast stock-based compensation expense for
    any given quarter or year. Any changes in these highly
    subjective assumptions may significantly impact our ability to
    make accurate forecasts of future earnings and volatility of our
    stock price. If another party asserts that the fair value of our
    employee stock options is misstated, securities class action
    litigation could be brought against us, or the market price of
    our common stock could decline, or both could occur. As a
    result, we could incur significant losses, and our operating
    results may be adversely affected.

Properties

Our headquarters site for corporate general administration,
    sales and marketing, research and development, global services,
    and operations is located in Sunnyvale, California. We own and
    occupy approximately 740,000 square feet of space in
    buildings at our Sunnyvale headquarters. In addition, we own a
    520,000 square foot facility in the Research Triangle Park,
    North Carolina, of which approximately 365,000 square feet
    is occupied by us primarily for research and development and
    global services.

In addition, we have commitments related to various lease
    arrangements with BNP Paribas LLC (“BNP”) for
    approximately 1,063,971 square feet of office space and a
    parking structure for our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California
    and a data center in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina (as
    further described below under “Contractual Cash Obligations
    and Other Commercial Commitments” in Item 7 and
    Note 4 under Item 8).

We lease other sales offices and research and development
    facilities throughout the U.S. and internationally. We
    expect that our existing facilities and those being developed in
    Sunnyvale, California; RTP, North Carolina; and worldwide are
    adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years
    and that additional space will be available as needed.

Legal
    Proceedings

On September 5, 2007, we filed a patent infringement
    lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory
    damages and a permanent injunction against Sun Microsystems
    (“Sun”). On October 25, 2007, Sun filed a counter
    claim against us in the Eastern District of Texas seeking
    compensatory damages and a permanent injunction. On
    October 29, 2007, Sun filed another lawsuit against us in
    the Northern District of California asserting additional patents
    against us. The Texas court granted a joint motion to transfer
    the Texas lawsuit to the Northern



District of California on November 26, 2007. On
    March 26, 2008, Sun filed a third lawsuit in federal court
    that extends the patent infringement charges to storage
    management technology we acquired in January 2008. We are unable
    at this time to determine the likely outcome of these various
    patent litigations. In addition, as we are unable to reasonably
    estimate the amount or range of the potential settlement, no
    accrual has been recorded as of April 25, 2008.

We received a subpoena from the Office of Inspector General for
    the General Services Administration (“GSA”) seeking
    various records relating to GSA contracting activity by us
    during the period beginning in 1995 and ending in 2005. The
    subpoena is part of an investigation being conducted by GSA and
    the Department of Justice regarding potential violations of the
    False Claims Act in connection with our GSA contracting
    activity. The subpoena requested a range of documents including
    documents relating to our discount practices and compliance with
    the price reduction clause provisions of its GSA contracts. We
    are cooperating with the investigation and have produced
    documents and met with the Department of Justice on several
    occasions. Violations of the False Claims Act could result in
    the imposition of a damage remedy which includes treble damages
    plus civil penalties, and could also result in us being
    suspended or debarred from future government contracting, any or
    a combination of which could have a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations or financial condition. However, as
    the investigation is still ongoing and we are unable at this
    time to determine the likely outcome of this matter, no
    provision has been recorded as of April 25, 2008.

Dividend
    Policy

We have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We
    currently anticipate retaining all available funds, if any, to
    finance internal growth and product development as well as other
    possible management initiatives, including stock repurchases and
    acquisitions. Payment of dividends in the future will depend
    upon our earnings and financial condition and such other factors
    as the directors may consider or deem appropriate at the time.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion of our financial condition and results
    of operations should be read together with the financial
    statements and the related notes set forth under
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data”. The following discussion also contains trend
    information and other forward looking statements that involve a
    number of risks and uncertainties. The Risk Factors set forth in
    “Item 1. Business” are hereby incorporated into
    the discussion by reference.

Overview

Enterprises are generating large quantities of data. We are
    experiencing a worldwide proliferation of data, driven by the
    rapid growth of broadband Internet access, the proliferation of
    data devices, exponential growth of digital information, and the
    need to protect critical data through replication. Significant
    data growth, tough economic conditions, physical data center
    limitations, including power, heat, space, and new, agile
    software development methodologies continue to stress enterprise
    storage infrastructure. Greater global demands on data access,
    more complex legal requirements, increasing consequences for
    data outages, and the need for greater data longevity all
    contribute to the growing burden on IT professionals. As the
    volume of data grows, so does the complexity of data storage and
    management. Data ownership and the burdens of managing data
    continue to challenge our enterprise customers.

In response, enterprises are looking for solutions to help
    simplify data storage and IT administration, improve the
    capabilities of storage systems and reduce total costs of
    ownership. Companies are migrating toward modular, unified
    storage systems and away from large, fixed, expensive,
    frame-class arrays and inefficient direct-attached storage. To
    maximize infrastructure efficiency, multiple dedicated servers
    can now be replaced by virtual servers sharing network-based
    resources such as common storage. There is a growing trend
    toward consolidating storage and serving a variety of
    applications from a unified storage pool.



During fiscal 2008, we continued to help customers transform
    their data center architectures through higher efficiencies and
    asset utilization, greater power and space savings, and
    innovative data center design and data management techniques. We
    also continued to make progress across many areas of the
    organization, including broadening and enhancing our enterprise
    solutions, supporting our channel and partners, and deepening
    our professional services coverage. We strengthened our
    strategic partnerships with server virtualization partners and
    leveraged our storage grid architecture to enable customers to
    scale their server and storage infrastructures, reduce costs,
    maximize asset utilization and keep data highly available. In
    March 2008, we launched a global branding and awareness campaign
    to increase the visibility of NetApp in the broader IT market.
    We believe that building our global brand awareness is a key
    factor to the long term success of our business in order to grow
    our customer base, increase our market share, and accelerate our
    revenue growth. The Onaro acquisition, completed on
    January 28, 2008, expanded our heterogeneous storage
    infrastructure and strengthened our storage and data management
    software portfolio by providing customers with new storage
    service management and change management capabilities. In
    addition, with our product introductions, we further extended
    our ability to help customers do “more with less”.

Our fiscal 2008 revenue growth was driven by continued demand
    across the world for our solutions particularly in international
    markets, and increased revenue from our U.S. commercial
    enterprise and U.S. Federal business, partially offset by
    continued softness in our top enterprise accounts. Revenue
    growth was attributable to increased product revenue with an
    expanded portfolio of new products and solutions for enterprise
    customers, increased software entitlements and maintenance
    revenue, and increased service revenue and was partially offset
    by lower-cost-per-megabyte disks and lower average selling
    prices of our older generation products. We believe our products
    continue to offer the best price-performance value in the
    industry.

While we reported solid results for fiscal 2008, we were not
    immune to macroeconomic conditions. We believe that our storage
    solutions provide customers with value propositions that will
    enable us to continue to gain market share in a more constrained
    spending environment. Our strategic investments are targeted at
    some of the strongest areas of the storage market, such as
    modular storage, archive and compliance, data protection, data
    management, data permanence, data security and privacy, iSCSI
    and grid computing. We believe that we are well positioned in
    the fastest growth segments of the storage market to capitalize
    on an IT spending recovery. However, if any storage market
    trends and emerging standards on which we are basing our
    assumptions do not materialize as anticipated, and if there is
    reduced or no demand for our products, our expected rate of
    revenue growth could be materially impacted. Continued revenue
    growth depends on the introduction and market acceptance of new
    products and solutions and continued market demand for our
    products. We will continue to invest in the people, processes,
    and systems necessary to best optimize our revenue growth and
    long-term profitability. However, we cannot assure you that such
    investments will result in achieving our financial objectives.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates and Policies

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
    of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial
    Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. The preparation of such statements requires us to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the
    financial statements. Our estimates are based on historical
    experience and other assumptions that we consider to be
    appropriate in the circumstances. However, actual future results
    may vary from our estimates.

We believe that the following accounting policies are
    “critical” as defined by the Securities and Exchange
    Commission, in that they are both highly important to the
    portrayal of our financial condition and results and require
    difficult management judgments and assumptions about matters
    that are inherently uncertain. We also have other important
    policies, including those related to derivative instruments and
    concentration of credit risk. However, these policies do not
    meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they
    do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that
    are difficult or subjective. These policies are discussed in
    Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    accompanying this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



We believe the accounting policies described below are the ones
    that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments
    and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results
    of operations:

•

Revenue recognition and allowances

•

Valuation of goodwill and intangibles

•

Accounting for income taxes

•

Inventory write-downs

•

Restructuring accruals

•

Impairment losses on investments

•

Accounting for stock-based compensation

•

Loss contingencies

Revenue
    Recognition and Allowances

We apply the provisions of Statement of Position
    (“SOP”)

No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

(SOP No. 97-2),

and related interpretations to our product sales, both hardware
    and software, because our software is essential to the
    performance of our hardware. We recognize revenue when:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists:

It is our customary practice to have a
    purchase order

and/or

contract prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement from our
    end users, customers, value-added resellers, or distributors.

•

Delivery has occurred:

Our product is
    physically delivered to our customers, generally with standard
    transfer terms such as FOB origin. We typically do not allow for
    restocking rights with any of our

value-added

resellers or distributors. Products shipped with acceptance
    criteria or return rights are not recognized as revenue until
    all criteria are achieved. If undelivered products or services
    exist that are essential to the functionality of the delivered
    product in an arrangement, delivery is not considered to have
    occurred.

•

The fee is fixed or determinable:

Arrangements
    with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms,
    conditions and practices are not considered to be fixed or
    determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized as
    the fees become due and payable. We typically do not allow for
    price-protection rights with any of our value-added resellers or
    distributors.

•

Collection is probable:

Probability of
    collection is assessed on a

customer-by-customer

basis. Customers are subjected to a credit review process that
    evaluates the customers’ financial position and ultimately
    their ability to pay. If it is determined at the outset of an
    arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our
    review process, revenue is recognized upon cash receipt.

Our multiple element arrangements include our systems and one or
    more of the following undelivered software-related elements:
    software entitlements and maintenance, premium hardware
    maintenance, and storage review services. Our software
    entitlements and maintenance entitle our customers to receive
    unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a

when-and-if-available

basis, bug fixes, and patch releases. Premium hardware
    maintenance services include contracts for technical support and
    minimum response times. Revenues from software entitlements and
    maintenance, premium hardware maintenance services and storage
    review services are recognized ratably over the contractual
    term, generally from one to three years. Standard hardware
    warranty costs are considered an obligation under
    SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

and
    expensed as a cost of service when revenue is recognized; such
    costs were $27.0 million in fiscal 2008, $22.1 million
    in fiscal 2007, and $18.5 million in fiscal 2006. We also
    offer extended service contracts (which extend our standard
    parts warranty and may include premium hardware maintenance) at
    the end of the warranty term; revenues from these contracts are
    recognized ratably over the contract term. We typically sell
    technical consulting services separately from any of our other
    revenue elements, either on a time and materials basis or for
    fixed price standard projects; we recognize revenue for these
    services as they are performed. Revenue from hardware
    installation services is recognized at the time of



delivery and any remaining costs are accrued, as the remaining
    undelivered services are considered to be inconsequential and
    perfunctory. For arrangements with multiple elements, we
    recognize as revenue the difference between the total
    arrangement price and the greater of fair value or stated price
    for any undelivered elements (“the residual method”).

For our undelivered software-related elements, we apply the
    provisions of

SOP No. 97-2

and determine fair value of these undelivered elements based on
    vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”), which for
    us consists of the prices charged when these services are sold
    separately either alone, in the case of software entitlements
    and maintenance, or as a bundled element which always includes
    software entitlements and maintenance and premium hardware
    maintenance, and may also include storage review services. To
    determine the fair value of these elements, we analyze both the
    selling prices when elements are sold separately as well as the
    concentrations of those prices. We believe those concentrations
    have been sufficient to enable us to establish VSOE of fair
    value for the undelivered elements. If VSOE cannot be obtained
    to establish fair value of the undelivered elements,
    paragraph 12 of

SOP No. 97-2

would require that revenue from the entire arrangement be
    initially deferred and recognized ratably over the period these
    elements are delivered.

For income statement presentation purposes, once fair value has
    been determined for our undelivered bundled elements, we
    allocate revenue first to software entitlements and maintenance,
    based on VSOE of its fair value with the remainder allocated to
    other service revenues.

We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at
    the time of shipment. Sales returns are estimated based on
    historical sales returns, current trends, and our expectations
    regarding future experience. We monitor and analyze the accuracy
    of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and
    adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of
    our current and future reserve needs. Our reserve levels have
    been sufficient to cover actual returns and have not required
    material changes in subsequent periods. While we currently have
    no expectations for significant changes to these reserves, if
    actual future returns and allowances differ from past
    experience, additional allowances may be required.

We also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for
    estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility
    of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts
    receivable. We analyze accounts receivable and historical bad
    debts, customer concentrations, customer solvency, current
    economic and geographic trends, and changes in customer payment
    terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of our current
    and future allowance. In circumstances where we are aware of a
    specific customer’s inability to meet its financial
    obligations to us, a specific allowance for bad debt is
    estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable
    to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected.
    We monitor and analyze the accuracy of allowance for doubtful
    accounts estimate by reviewing past collectibility and adjust it
    for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current
    and future allowance. Our reserve levels have generally been
    sufficient to cover credit losses. Our allowance for doubtful
    accounts as of April 25, 2008 was $2.4 million,
    compared to $2.6 million as of April 27, 2007. If the
    financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate,
    resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments,
    additional allowances may be required.

Valuation
    of Goodwill and Intangibles

Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over time, while
    in-process research and development is recorded as a charge on
    the date of acquisition and goodwill is capitalized, subject to
    periodic review for impairment. Accordingly, the allocation of
    the acquisition cost to identifiable intangible assets has a
    significant impact on our future operating results. The
    allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and
    assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows expected
    to be generated by the acquired assets. Should conditions be
    different than management’s current assessment, material
    write-downs of the fair value of intangible assets may be
    required. We periodically review the estimated remaining useful
    lives of our other intangible assets. In addition, a reduction
    in the estimate of remaining useful life could result in
    accelerated amortization expense or a write-down in future
    periods. As such, any future write-downs of these assets would
    adversely affect our gross and operating margins. We currently
    do not foresee changes to useful lives or write-downs to these
    assets.

Under our accounting policy we perform an annual review in the
    fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators
    of impairment exist. Triggering events for impairment reviews
    may be indicators such as adverse



industry or economic trends, restructuring actions, lower
    projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in our
    market capitalization. Evaluations of possible impairment and,
    if applicable, adjustments to carrying values require us to
    estimate, among other factors, future cash flows, useful lives,
    and fair market values of our reporting units and assets. When
    we conduct our evaluation of goodwill, the fair value of
    goodwill is assessed using valuation techniques that require
    significant management judgment. Should conditions be different
    from management’s last assessment, significant write-downs
    of goodwill may be required. In fiscal 2008 we performed such
    evaluation and found no impairment. However, any future
    write-downs of goodwill would adversely affect our operating
    margins. As of April 25, 2008, our assets included
    $680.1 million in goodwill. See Note 14,
    “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets,” to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

During fiscal 2008, we recorded goodwill of $79.2 million
    in connection with our Onaro acquisition and a decrease of
    goodwill for $0.2 million in connection with the escrow
    received from our Topio acquisition in fiscal 2007.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

The determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments
    and estimates due to the complexity of the tax law that we are
    subject to in several tax jurisdictions. Earnings derived from
    our international business are generally taxed at rates that are
    lower than U.S. rates, resulting in a lower effective tax
    rate than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0%. The ability
    to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent on
    existing tax laws in both the United States and the
    respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are
    located. Future changes in domestic or international tax laws
    could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we
    are currently receiving. In addition, a decrease in the
    percentage of our total earnings from international business or
    a change in the mix of international business among particular
    tax jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate.

We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 109,
    “

Accounting for Income Taxes.

”
    SFAS No. 109 requires that deferred tax assets and
    liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
    used for income tax purposes. SFAS No. 109 also
    requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation
    allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the
    deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have provided a
    valuation allowance of $28.6 million as of April 25,
    2008, compared to $21.0 million as of April 27, 2007
    on certain of our deferred tax assets. We adopted
    SFAS No. 123R effective the beginning of our fiscal
    year ended April 27, 2007. Under SFAS No. 123R,
    tax attributes related to the exercise of employee stock options
    should not be realized until they result in a reduction of taxes
    payable. Pursuant to Footnote 82 of SFAS No. 123R, on
    a prospective basis we no longer include unrealized stock option
    attributes as components of our gross deferred tax assets and
    corresponding valuation allowance disclosures. The tax effected
    amounts of gross unrealized net operating loss and business tax
    credit carryforwards, and their corresponding valuation
    allowance excluded under Footnote 82 for the years ended
    April 25, 2008 and April 27, 2007 are
    $245.1 million and $363.3 million, respectively.

We are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the
    United States and several foreign tax jurisdictions. The rights
    to some of our intellectual property (“IP”) are owned
    by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made
    between foreign and U.S. tax jurisdictions relating to the
    use of this IP in a qualified cost sharing arrangement.
    Recently, several other U.S. companies have had their
    foreign IP arrangements challenged as part of IRS examinations,
    which have resulted in material proposed assessments

and/or

pending litigation. Effective September 27, 2007, the
    IRS’s Large and Mid-Sized Business Division
    (“LMSB”) released a Coordinated Issues Paper
    (“CIP”) with respect to qualified cost sharing
    arrangements (“CSAs”). Specifically, this CIP provides
    guidance to IRS personnel concerning methods that may be applied
    to evaluate the arm’s length charge (buy-in payment) for
    internally developed (pre-existing) as well as
    acquisition-related intangible property that is made available
    to a qualified CSA. We have evaluated the IRS’s positions
    in this CIP and have concluded that it will not have a material
    adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and the
    results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, our
    management does not believe, based upon information currently
    known to us that the final resolution of any of our audits will
    have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
    position and the results of operations and cash flows. However,
    if upon the conclusion of these audits the ultimate
    determination of



our taxes owed in any of these tax jurisdictions is for an
    amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or
    reserved for, our overall effective tax rate may be adversely
    impacted in the period of adjustment.

Effective March 20, 2008, the IRS’s LMSB also released
    a CIP with respect to the cost sharing of stock based
    compensation. Specifically, this CIP provides guidance to IRS
    personnel concerning stock based compensation related to a CSA
    by providing that the parties to a CSA will share all costs
    related to intangible development of the covered intangibles,
    including but not limited to, salaries, bonuses, and other
    payroll costs and benefits. Taxpayers should include all forms
    of compensation in the cost pool, including those costs related
    to stock-based compensation. We have evaluated the IRS’s
    positions in this CIP and have concluded that it will not have a
    material adverse impact upon our consolidated financial position
    and the results of operations and cash flows.

On April 28, 2007, we adopted FIN No. 48.
    FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in
    income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial
    statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. This
    interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and
    measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
    and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
    in a tax return. As a result of the implementation of
    FIN No. 48, we recognize the tax liability for
    uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on
    the two-step process prescribed in the interpretation. The first
    step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that
    each income tax position would be sustained upon audit. The
    second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the
    amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
    upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority. Estimating
    these amounts requires us to determine the probability of
    various possible outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax
    positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on the
    consideration of several factors, including changes in facts or
    circumstances, changes in applicable tax law, settlement of
    issues under audit, and new exposures. If we later determine
    that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not
    sufficient to cover our revised expectations, we adjust the
    liability and effect a related change in our tax provision
    during the period in which we make such determination.

Inventory
    Write-Downs

Our inventory balance was $70.2 million as of
    April 25, 2008, compared to $54.9 million as of
    April 27, 2007. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out basis) or market. We perform an in-depth excess and
    obsolete analysis of our inventory based upon assumptions about
    future demand and market conditions. We adjust the inventory
    value based on estimated excess and obsolete inventories
    determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Although we
    strive for accuracy in our forecasts of future product demand,
    any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological
    developments could have a significant impact on the value of our
    inventory and commitments and on our reported results. If actual
    market conditions are less favorable than those projected,
    additional write-downs and other charges against earnings may be
    required. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may
    realize higher gross margins in the period when the written-down
    inventory is sold. During the past few years, our inventory
    reserves have generally been sufficient to cover excess and
    obsolete exposure and have not required material changes in
    subsequent periods.

We engage in extensive, ongoing product quality programs and
    processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the
    quality of our component suppliers. We also provide for the
    estimated cost of known product failures based on known quality
    issues when they arise. Should actual cost of product failure
    differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated liability
    would be required.

We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and
    foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage,
    discharge, and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our
    manufacturing process or requiring design changes or recycling
    of products we manufacture. We will continue to monitor our
    environmental compliance and could incur higher costs, including
    additional reserves for excess component inventory.

Restructuring
    Accruals

In fiscal 2002, we implemented a restructuring plan related to
    the closure of an engineering facility and consolidation of
    resources to our Sunnyvale headquarters. In fiscal 2006, we
    implemented a restructuring plan related to the move of our
    global service center operations. In determining restructuring
    charges, we analyze our



future business requirements in order to properly align and
    manage our business commensurate with our future revenue levels.

Our restructuring costs, and any resulting accruals, involve
    significant estimates made by management using the best
    information available at the time the estimates are made, some
    of which may be provided by third parties. In recording
    severance reserves, we accrue a liability when the following
    conditions have been met: employees’ rights to receive
    compensation are attributable to employees’ services
    already rendered, the obligation relates to rights that vest or
    accumulate, payment of the compensation is probable, and the
    amount can be reasonably estimated. In recording the facilities
    lease restructuring reserve, we make various assumptions,
    including the time period over which the facilities are expected
    to be vacant, expected sublease terms, expected sublease rates,
    anticipated future operating expenses, and expected future use
    of the facilities.

Our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some
    of which are beyond our control, including future real estate
    market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into
    subleases or lease termination agreements with terms as
    favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates. We
    regularly evaluate a number of factors to determine the
    appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring and
    lease loss accruals, including the various assumptions noted
    above. If actual results differ significantly from our
    estimates, we may be required to adjust our restructuring and
    lease loss accruals in the future. We estimated our facility
    restructuring reserve to be $1.9 million as of
    April 25, 2008. In fiscal 2008, we recorded charges of
    $0.4 million to the restructuring reserve resulting from a
    change in estimated operating expenses and rent escalations. In
    fiscal 2006, our facility restructuring reserve included a
    $1.3 million reduction related to the execution of a new
    sublease agreement for our Tewksbury facility, net of related
    costs.

Impairment
    Losses on Investments

All of our available-for-sale investments and nonmarketable
    securities are subject to a periodic impairment review.
    Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair
    value is judged to be other-than-temporary. This determination
    requires significant judgment. For publicly traded investments,
    impairment is determined based upon the specific facts and
    circumstances present at the time, including factors such as
    current economic and market conditions, the credit rating of the
    security’s issuer, the length of time an investment’s
    fair value has been below our carrying value, our ability and
    intent to hold investments to maturity or for a period of time
    sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
    If an investment’s decline in fair value, caused by factors
    other than changes in interest rates, is deemed to be
    other-than-temporary, we would reduce its carrying value to its
    estimated fair value, as determined based on quoted market
    prices, liquidation values or other metrics. For investments in
    publicly held companies, we recognize an impairment charge when
    the declines in the fair values of our investments in these
    companies are below their cost basis and are judged to be
    other-than-temporary. The ultimate value realized on these
    investments in publicly held companies is subject to market
    price volatility until they are sold.

We actively review, along with our investment advisors, current
    investment ratings, company specific events, and general
    economic conditions in managing our investments and determining
    whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is
    other-than-temporary. We have not experienced any material
    losses on our available-for-sale investments. To the extent we
    determine that a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary,
    the associated investment is valued at current fair value and an
    impairment charge is reflected in earnings.

As of April 25, 2008 and April 27, 2007, our
    short-term investments have been classified as
    “available-for-sale” and are carried at fair value.
    Currently, all marketable securities held by us are classified
    as available-for-sale and our entire auction rate securities
    (ARS) portfolio is classified as long-term investments. The ARS
    held by us are securities with long term nominal maturities
    which, in accordance with investment policy guidelines, had
    credit ratings of AAA and Aaa at time of purchase. Substantially
    all of our ARS are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed
    by the U.S. Department of Education. We believe that the
    underlying credit quality of the assets backing our ARS
    investments have not been impacted by the reduced liquidity of
    these investments. Based on an analysis of the fair value and
    marketability of these investments, we recorded a temporary
    impairment within other accumulated comprehensive income, an
    element of stockholders’ equity on our balance sheet, of
    approximately $3.5 million at April 25, 2008.



The valuation models used to estimate the auction rate
    securities fair value included numerous assumptions such as
    assessments of the underlying structure of each security,
    expected cash flows, discount rates, credit ratings, workout
    periods, and overall capital market liquidity. These
    assumptions, assessments and the interpretations of relevant
    market data are subject to uncertainties, are difficult to
    predict and require significant judgment. The use of different
    assumptions, applying different judgment to inherently
    subjective matters and changes in future market conditions could
    result in significantly different estimates of fair value. There
    is no assurance as to when the market for auction rate
    securities will stabilize. The fair value of our auction rate
    securities could change significantly based on market conditions
    and continued uncertainties in the credit markets. If these
    uncertainties continue or if these securities experience credit
    rating downgrades, we may incur additional temporary impairment
    on our auction rate securities portfolio. We will continue to
    monitor the fair value of our auction rate securities and
    relevant market conditions and will record additional temporary
    or other-than-temporary impairments if future circumstances
    warrant such charges.

For nonmarketable securities, the impairment analysis requires
    the identification of events or circumstances that would likely
    have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the
    investment, including revenue and earnings trends, overall
    business prospects, limited capital resources, limited prospects
    of receiving additional financing, limited prospects for
    liquidity of the related securities, and general market
    conditions in the investees’ industries. The carrying value
    of our investments in privately-held companies were
    $11.2 million and $8.9 million as of April 25,
    2008 and April 27, 2007, respectively. During fiscal 2008,
    we recorded an impairment of $1.6 million for investments
    in privately-held companies, which was recorded in net gain
    (loss) on investments in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our employee stock
    options. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the
    date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
    Option pricing models require the input of highly subjective
    assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility,
    expected life, and forfeiture rate. Any changes in these highly
    subjective assumptions may significantly impact the stock-based
    compensation expense for the future.

Loss
    Contingencies

We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies
    arising in the course of business. We consider the likelihood of
    the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a
    liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the
    amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated
    loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability
    has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount
    of loss can be reasonably estimated. In fiscal 2008, 2007 and
    2006, we did not identify or accrue for any loss contingencies.
    We regularly evaluate current information available to us to
    determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.

New
    Accounting Standards

In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued a new final Staff Position
    (“FSP”) No. APB

14-1

“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlements).”

Under the final FSP, cash settled
    convertible securities would be separated into their debt and
    equity components. The value assigned to the debt component
    would be the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of a
    similar debt instrument without the conversion feature, and the
    difference between the proceeds for the convertible debt and the
    amount reflected as a debt liability would be recorded as
    additional paid-in capital. As a result, the debt would be
    recorded at a discount reflecting its below-market coupon
    interest rate. The debt would subsequently be accreted to its
    par value over its expected life, with the rate of interest that
    reflects the market rate at issuance being reflected on the
    income statement. This change in methodology will affect the
    calculations of net income and earnings per share for many
    issuers of cash settled convertible securities. The final FSP
    requires explicit disclosure requirements and will be effective
    for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal
    years. This final FSP is to be applied



retrospectively to all periods presented. This standard will
    have an effect on the company’s convertible debenture sold
    in June 2008 as described in Note 17, Subsequent Events.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 161,

“Disclosures
    about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities —
    An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”

(SFAS No. 161). SFAS No. 161 requires
    additional disclosures about the objectives of using derivative
    instruments, the method by which the derivative instruments and
    related hedged items are accounted for under FASB Statement
    No. 133 and its related interpretations, and the effect of
    derivative instruments and related hedged items on financial
    position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161
    also requires disclosure of the fair value of derivative
    instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format. This
    statement is effective for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. We
    are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the adoption
    of SFAS No. 161 will have on our consolidated
    financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),

“Business Combinations”

(SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R)
    establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in
    a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial
    statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
    assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the
    acquisition date fair value. SFAS No. 141(R)
    determines what information to disclose to enable users of the
    financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial
    effects of the business combination. We are required to adopt
    SFAS No. 141(R) at the beginning of the first quarter
    of fiscal 2010, which begins on April 25, 2009. We are
    currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 141(R) will have on our consolidated
    financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51.”

(SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 will change
    the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will
    be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as
    a component of equity. This new consolidation method will
    significantly change the accounting for transactions with
    minority interest holders. We are required to adopt
    SFAS No. 160 at the beginning of the first quarter of
    fiscal 2010, which begins on April 25, 2009. We are
    currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 160 will have on our consolidated financial
    statements.

Effective April 28, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation
    (“FIN”) No. 48. FIN No. 48 prescribes a
    comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure,
    present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax
    positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return
    (including a decision whether to file or not to file a return in
    a particular jurisdiction). FIN No. 48 is applicable
    to all uncertain tax positions for taxes accounted for under
    SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income
    Taxes,”

and substantially changes the applicable
    accounting model. There was no cumulative effect from the
    adoption of FIN No. 48. As a result of the
    implementation of FIN No. 48, we recognize the tax
    liability for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax
    return based on the two-step process prescribed in the
    interpretation. The first step is to determine whether it is
    more likely than not that each income tax position would be
    sustained upon audit. The second step is to estimate and measure
    the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than 50%
    likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the
    tax authority. Estimating these amounts requires us to determine
    the probability of various possible outcomes. We evaluate these
    uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. See
    “Note 8, Income Taxes,” for further discussion.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Financial Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 115 “Accounting for Certain Investments
    in Debt and Equity Securities.”

SFAS No. 159
    allows measurement at fair value of eligible financial assets
    and liabilities that are not otherwise measured at fair value.
    If the fair value option for an eligible item is elected,
    unrealized gains and losses for that item shall be reported in
    current earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
    SFAS No. 159 also establishes presentation and
    disclosure requirements designed to draw comparison between the
    different measurement attributes the company elects for similar
    types of assets and liabilities. We are required to adopt
    SFAS No. 159 at the beginning of the first quarter of
    fiscal 2009, which began on April 26, 2008. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 159 is not expected to have a material impact
    on our financial position or results of operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157

“Fair Value Measurements.”

SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted
    accounting principles, and



expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 affects other accounting pronouncements
    that require or permit fair value measurements where the FASB
    has previously concluded that fair value is the relevant
    measurement attribute. SFAS No. 157 does not require
    any new fair value measurements, but may change current practice
    in some instances. SFAS No. 157 is effective for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We will
    adopt SFAS No. 157 in the first quarter of fiscal year
    2009. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

No. 157-2

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”

(“FSP 157-2”).

FSP 157-2

permits a one-year deferral in applying the measurement
    provisions of SFAS 157 to non-financial assets and
    non-financial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed
    at fair value in an entity’s financial statements on a
    recurring basis (at least annually). The adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 and

FSP 157-2

is not expected to have a material impact on our financial
    position or results of operations.

Fiscal
    2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007

Total Revenues

— Total revenues increased by
    17.8% to $3,303.2 million in fiscal 2008, from
    $2,804.3 million in fiscal 2007. Our fiscal 2008 revenue
    growth was attributable to increased product revenues, software
    entitlements and maintenance revenues, and service revenues, and
    was partially offset by reduced revenues from older generation
    products. Sales through our indirect channels, including
    resellers, distributors, and OEM partners, represented 63.0% and
    59.6% of total revenues for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Product Revenues

— Product revenues increased
    by $156.6 million or 7.5% to $2,242.5 million in
    fiscal 2008, from $2,085.9 million in fiscal 2007. The
    increase was comprised of a net $151.2 million increase in
    unit volume and $5.4 million in price and product
    configuration.

Revenues from our expanded portfolio of new products for
    enterprise customers (products we began shipping in the last
    twelve months) increased $267.9 million, while revenues
    from our existing products rose $657.9 million. Increased
    revenues from new products included our FAS 2000
    entry-level systems and recent product introductions in our
    FAS 6000 series high-end enterprise storage systems.
    Increased revenues from existing products were primarily from
    our FAS 3000 mid-range products.

These increases were partially offset by a $769.2 million
    decrease in shipments of our older generation products (older or
    end-of-life products with declining year over year revenue as
    well as products we no longer ship), including older generation
    FAS 3000 systems as well as our FAS 900 series systems
    and
    NearStore

®

R200 systems.

Our systems are highly configurable to respond to customer
    requirements in the open systems storage markets that we serve.
    This wide variation in customized configuration can
    significantly impact revenue, cost of revenue, and gross margin
    performance. Price changes, volumes, and product model mix can
    also impact revenue, cost of revenue and gross margin
    performance. Disks are a significant component of our storage
    systems. Industry disk pricing continues to fall every year, and
    we pass along those price decreases to our customers while
    working to maintain relatively constant margins on our disk
    drives. While price per petabyte continues to decline, system
    performance and increased capacity have an offsetting impact on
    product revenue.

Software Entitlements and Maintenance
    Revenues

— Software entitlements and maintenance
    revenues increased by 42.7% to $486.9 million in fiscal
    2008, from $341.3 million in fiscal 2007. The year over
    year increase was due to a larger installed base of customers
    who have purchased or renewed software entitlements and
    maintenance. Software entitlements and maintenance revenues
    represented 14.7% and 12.2% of total revenues for fiscal 2008
    and 2007, respectively.

Service Revenues

— Service revenues, which
    include hardware support, professional services, and educational
    services, increased by 52.1% to $573.8 million in fiscal
    2008, from $377.1 million in fiscal 2007.

Professional service revenue increased by 58.8% in fiscal 2008
    compared to fiscal 2007. The increase was due to higher customer
    demand for our professional services in connection with the
    integration of our solutions into their IT environments. Service
    maintenance revenue increased by 51.2% in fiscal 2008 compared
    to fiscal 2007 due to an installed base which has grown over
    time as a result of new customer support contracts and renewals
    from existing customers.

While it is an element of our strategy to expand and offer more
    comprehensive global enterprise support and service solutions,
    we cannot assure you that service revenue will grow at the
    current rate in fiscal 2009 or beyond.

A large portion of our service revenues are deferred and, in
    most cases, recognized ratably over the service obligation
    period, which is typically one to three years. Service revenues
    represented 17.4% and 13.4% of total revenues for fiscal years
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Total International Revenues

— Total
    international revenues (including U.S. exports) increased
    by 23.9% in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. Total
    international revenues were $1,554.3 million, or 47.1% of
    total revenues for fiscal 2008, compared to
    $1,254.0 million, or 44.7% of total revenues for fiscal
    2007. The year over year increase was driven by the product,
    software entitlement and maintenance, and service revenue
    factors outlined above. We cannot assure you that we will be
    able to maintain or increase international revenues in fiscal
    2009 or beyond.



Product Gross Margin

— Product gross margin
    decreased to 59.4% in fiscal 2008 from 60.9% in fiscal 2007.

Product gross margin was negatively impacted by rebates and
    initiatives taken throughout the year and directed primarily to
    various indirect channels. We expect future product gross margin
    may continue to be impacted by a variety of factors including
    selective price reductions and discounts, increased indirect
    channel sales, increases in software revenues and new higher
    margin products.

Stock-based compensation expense included in cost of product
    revenues was $3.4 million in fiscal 2008 compared to
    $3.7 million in fiscal 2007. Amortization of existing
    technology included in cost of product revenues was
    $22.6 million and $17.6 million for fiscal 2008 and
    2007, respectively. Estimated future amortization of existing
    technology to cost of product revenues will be
    $26.3 million for fiscal year 2009, $21.8 million for
    fiscal year 2010, $12.2 million for fiscal year 2011,
    $5.9 million for fiscal year 2012, $4.4 million for
    fiscal year 2013, and none thereafter.

Software Entitlements and Maintenance Gross
    Margin

— Software entitlements and maintenance
    gross margin increased to 98.2% for fiscal 2008 from 97.0% for
    fiscal 2007. The improved software entitlements and maintenance
    gross margin year over year was due to larger installed base
    renewals and upgrades.

Service Gross Margin

— Service gross margin
    increased to 35.6% in fiscal 2008 compared to 27.4% in fiscal
    2007. Cost of service revenue increased by 35.1% to
    $369.8 million in fiscal 2008, from $273.6 million in
    fiscal 2007. Stock-based compensation expense of
    $10.4 million and $10.1 million was included in the
    cost of service revenue for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The improvement in service gross margins year over year was
    primarily due to an increase in service revenue volume and
    improved productivity, partially offset by increased service
    infrastructure spending to support our customers. This spending
    included additional professional support engineers, increased
    support center activities and global service partnership
    programs. Service gross margins will typically be impacted by
    factors such as timing of technical support service initiations
    and renewals and additional investments in our customer support
    infrastructure. For fiscal 2009, we expect service margins to
    experience some variability as we continue to build out our
    service capability and capacity to support our growing customer
    base and new products.

Sales and Marketing

— Sales and marketing
    expense consists primarily of salaries, commissions, advertising
    and promotional expenses, stock-based compensation expense, and
    certain customer service and support costs. Sales and marketing
    expense increased 20.1% to $1,075.6 million in fiscal 2008,
    from $895.8 million in fiscal 2007. This expense as a
    percentage of revenue increased to 32.6% in fiscal 2008, from
    32.0% in fiscal 2007. The increase in sales and marketing
    expense was due to increased commission expense resulting from
    higher revenues, higher headcount, higher branding campaign
    costs, and the continued worldwide investment in our sales and
    global service organizations.

Stock compensation expense included in sales and marketing
    expense for fiscal 2008 was $65.4 million compared to
    $71.7 million in fiscal 2007. Amortization of
    trademarks/trade names and customer contracts/relationships
    included in sales and marketing expense was $4.2 million
    and $2.9 million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007,
    respectively. Based on identified intangibles related to our
    acquisitions recorded at April 25, 2008, estimated future
    amortization such as trademarks and customer relationships
    included in sales and marketing expense will be
    $4.9 million for fiscal 2009, $4.8 million for fiscal
    2010, $3.8 million for fiscal 2011, $2.6 million for
    fiscal 2012, $1.4 million for fiscal 2013 and
    $1.3 million thereafter.

We expect to continue to add sales capacity in an effort to
    expand our penetration of domestic and international markets,
    and establish and expand our distribution channels. We expect to
    increase sales and marketing expense to support our future
    revenue growth. We believe that our sales and marketing expense
    will increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2009 due to
    increased headcount, sales and marketing related programs to
    support future revenue growth, higher branding campaign costs
    and real estate lease payments, partially offset by reduced
    discretionary spending.

Research and Development

— Research and
    development expense consists primarily of salaries and benefits,
    stock-based compensation, prototype expenses, engineering
    charges, consulting fees, and amortization of capitalized
    patents.



Research and development expense increased 17.3% to
    $452.2 million in fiscal 2008 from $385.4 million in
    fiscal 2007. This expense as a percentage of revenue was 13.7%
    in both fiscal 2008 and 2007. The increase in research and
    development expense was primarily a result of increased
    headcount-related salaries and incentive compensation, and
    future product development. For both fiscal 2008 and 2007, no
    software development costs were capitalized.

Stock compensation expense included in research and development
    expense for fiscal 2008 was $46.6 million compared to
    $51.3 million in fiscal 2007. Also included in research and
    development expense is capitalized patents amortization of
    $2.0 million in both fiscal 2008 and 2007. Based on
    capitalized patents recorded at April 25, 2008, estimated
    future capitalized patent amortization expenses will be
    $0.5 million for fiscal year 2009, $0.1 million in
    fiscal 2010, and none thereafter.

We believe that our future performance will depend in large part
    on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line,
    develop new products that achieve market acceptance, maintain
    technological competitiveness, and meet an expanding range of
    customer requirements. We expect to continuously support current
    and future product development, broaden our existing product
    offerings and introduce new products that expand our solutions
    portfolio.

We believe that our research and development expense will
    increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2009, primarily due to
    costs associated with the development of new products and
    technologies, headcount growth, and real estate lease payments.

General and Administrative

— General and
    administrative expense increased 16.3% to $171.5 million
    for fiscal 2008 from $147.5 million for fiscal 2007. This
    expense as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly to 5.2%
    for fiscal 2008 from 5.3% for fiscal 2007. The increase in
    absolute dollars was primarily due to increased headcount and
    associated payroll expenses, higher expenses related to prior
    acquisitions, and increased professional and legal fees for
    general corporate matters.

We believe that our general and administrative expense will
    increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2009 due to spending
    required to support and enhance our existing infrastructure as
    well as real estate lease payments, partially offset by reduced
    discretionary spending. Stock compensation expense included in
    general and administrative expense for fiscal 2008 and 2007 was
    $22.1 million and $26.2 million, respectively.
    Amortization of covenants not to compete included in general and
    administrative expense was $0.2 million and
    $1.0 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Restructuring Charges

— In fiscal 2002, we
    implemented a restructuring plan related to the closure of an
    engineering facility and consolidation of resources to our
    Sunnyvale headquarters. In fiscal 2006, we implemented a
    restructuring plan related to the move of our global service
    center operations from Sunnyvale to our new flagship support
    center at our Research Triangle Park facility in North Carolina.

Our restructuring estimates are reviewed and revised
    periodically and may result in a substantial charge or reduction
    to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail
    than were anticipated in previous management estimates. Such
    estimates included various assumptions such as the time period
    over which the facilities will be vacant, expected sublease
    terms, and expected sublease rates. In fiscal 2008, we recorded
    charges of $0.4 million to the restructuring reserve
    resulting from a change in the estimated operating expenses and
    rent escalations related to our 2002 restructuring plan.

Of the reserve balance at April 25, 2008, $0.6 million
    was included in other accrued liabilities, and the remaining
    $1.3 million was classified as long-term obligations. The
    balance of the reserve relates to facilities and is expected to
    be paid by fiscal 2011.



The following analysis sets forth the significant components of
    the restructuring reserve at April 25, 2008

Gain on Sale of Assets

— We recorded a gain of
    $25.3 million in fiscal 2007 as a result of the sale of
    certain assets to Blue Coat Systems, Inc (“Blue Coat”).

Operating Income

— Operating income as a
    percentage of revenue decreased to 9.4% for fiscal 2008 from
    10.7% for fiscal 2007. Operating income for fiscal 2007 included
    a gain on sale of assets of $25.3 million. Our operating
    expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to
    future revenue growth, and a significant percentage of our
    operating expenses are fixed and difficult to reduce within a
    short period of time. As a result, if revenue levels are below
    expectations, our fixed expenses could adversely affect our
    operating income and cash flow until revenues increase or until
    such fixed expenses are reduced to a level commensurate with
    revenues. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain
    or increase revenues for fiscal 2009 or beyond.

Interest Income

— Interest income was
    $64.6 million and $68.8 million for fiscal 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The slight decrease in interest income was
    primarily driven by lower average interest rates on our
    investment portfolio and lower cash and investment balances. We
    expect that period-to-period changes in interest income will
    continue to be impacted by the volatility of market interest
    rates, cash and investment balances, cash generated by
    operations, timing of our stock repurchases, capital
    expenditures, and payments of our contractual obligations.

Interest Expense

— Interest expense was
    $8.0 million and $11.6 million in fiscal 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal
    2008 was due to full repayment of the loan agreement entered
    with JPMorgan (“Loan Agreement”), partially offset by
    increased interest expense on the $250.0 million
    outstanding under the revolving secured credit agreement with
    JPMorgan Securities (see Note 6). We expect
    period-to-period changes in interest expense to continue to be
    subject to market interest rate volatility and amounts due under
    various loan agreements.

Net Gain (Loss) on Investments

— Net gain on
    sale of investments was $12.6 million for fiscal 2008. Net
    gain for fiscal 2008 consisted primarily of a gain of
    $13.6 million related to the sale of shares of Blue Coat
    common stock offset by a net write-down of $1.0 million for
    our investments in privately-held companies. For fiscal 2007,
    net loss on sale of investments was $1.5 million, including
    a net write-down of $2.1 million related to the impairment
    of our investment in privately-held companies.

Other Income (Expense), Net

— Other expense was
    $0.1 million for fiscal 2008 and consisted of net exchange
    losses from foreign currency of $0.7 million, partially
    offset by other income of $0.6 million. Other income was
    $2.8 million for fiscal 2007, and consisted of net exchange
    gains from foreign currency of $2.4 million and other
    income of $0.4 million. We believe that period-to-period
    changes in foreign exchange gains or losses will continue to be
    impacted by hedging costs associated with our forward and option
    activities and forecast variance.



Provision for Income Taxes

— For fiscal 2008
    and 2007, we applied to pretax income an annual effective tax
    rate before discrete reporting items of 13.3% and 19.0%,
    respectively. The decrease to the annual effective tax rate year
    over year is primarily attributable to a relative increase in
    the benefits attributable to our foreign operations, as well as
    to a relative decrease in the tax impact of nondeductible stock
    compensation under SFAS No. 123R, brought about in
    part by our decision to cease granting incentive stock options.
    Since we have replaced the granting of incentive stock options
    with the granting of nonqualified stock options, this gives rise
    to the recognition of more deferred tax assets as
    SFAS No. 123R expense occurs. After taking into
    account the tax effect of discrete items reported, the effective
    tax rates applied to the pretax income for fiscal 2008 and 2007
    were 19.1% and 17.2%, respectively.

Fiscal
    2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006

Total Revenues

— Total revenues increased by
    35.7% to $2,804.3 million in fiscal 2007, from
    $2,066.5 million in fiscal 2006. Our fiscal 2007 revenue
    growth was attributable to increased product revenues, software
    entitlements and maintenance revenues, and service revenues, and
    was partially offset by reduced revenues from older generation
    products. Sales through our indirect channels which include
    resellers, distributors, and OEM partners represented 59.6% and
    55.5% of total revenues for fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Product Revenues

— Product revenues increased
    by 32.2% to $2,085.9 million in fiscal 2007, from
    $1,577.4 million in fiscal 2006. Product revenue increased
    $686.9 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006,
    due to a $669.7 million increase in unit volume and an
    increase of $17.2 million due to price and configuration on
    our existing products as well as increased revenues from
    existing products. Increased revenues from our new products
    include certain FAS 3000 mid-range products, V-Series
    systems, NearStore Virtual Tape Library systems and Datafort
    storage security appliances. Increased revenue from existing
    products included certain FAS 6000 series high-end
    enterprise storage systems and certain FAS 3000 products.

These increases were partially offset by a $376.3 million
    decrease in shipments of our older generation products (i.e.
    older or end-of-life products with declining year over year
    revenue as well as products we no longer ship), including
    FAS 900 series systems,
    NearStore

®

R200 systems and NetCache products we no longer ship.

Software Entitlements and Maintenance
    Revenues

— Software entitlements and maintenance
    revenues increased by 42.7% to $341.3 million in fiscal
    2007, from $239.1 million in fiscal 2006 due primarily to a
    larger installed base of customers who have purchased or renewed
    software entitlements and maintenance contracts. Software
    entitlements and maintenance revenues represented 12.2% and
    11.6% of total revenues for fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Service Revenues

— Service revenues, which
    include hardware support, professional services, and educational
    services, increased by 50.9% to $377.1 million in fiscal
    2007, from $249.9 million in fiscal 2006.

Professional service revenue increased by 56.4% in fiscal 2007
    compared to fiscal 2006. The increase was due to an increasing
    number of enterprise customers, which typically have extremely
    complex IT environments and require professional services to
    integrate our solution into their environments. Service
    maintenance contracts increased by 48.3% in fiscal 2007 compared
    to fiscal 2006, due to an installed base which has grown over
    time as a result of new customer support contracts, and support
    contracts and renewals from existing customers.

A large portion of our service revenues are deferred and, in
    most cases, recognized ratably over the service obligation
    periods, which are typically one to three years. Service
    revenues represented 13.4% and 12.1% of total revenues for
    fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Total International Revenues

— Total
    international revenues (including U.S. exports) increased
    by 32.9% in fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Total
    international revenues were $1,254.0 million, or 44.7% of
    total revenues for fiscal 2007, compared to $943.8 million,
    or 45.7% of total revenues for fiscal 2006.

Product Gross Margin

— Product gross margin was
    60.9% for both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006.

Product gross margin for both fiscal 2007 and 2006 were affected
    by the following factors:

•

Higher average selling price and gross margins in fiscal 2007
    related to new products

•

SFAS 123R stock compensation expenses recorded in fiscal
    2007 versus none in fiscal 2006



•

Sales price reductions due to competitive pricing pressure and
    selective pricing discounts

•

Increased sales through certain indirect channels, which
    generates lower gross margin than our direct sales in certain
    geographic regions

•

Higher disk content with an expanded storage capacity for the
    higher-end storage systems, as resale of disk drives generates
    lower gross margins

Stock-based compensation expense included in cost of product
    revenues was $3.7 million for fiscal 2007. Amortization of
    existing technology included in cost of product revenues was
    $17.6 million and $11.8 million for fiscal 2007 and
    2006, respectively.

Software Entitlements and Maintenance Gross
    Margin

— Software entitlements and maintenance
    gross margin was 97.0% and 96.5% for fiscal 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, due primarily to improved productivity and a
    larger installed base, renewals, upgrades, and an increasing mix
    of enterprise customers.

Service Gross Margin

— Service gross margin
    increased to 27.4% in fiscal 2007 compared to 25.9% in fiscal
    2006. Cost of service revenue increased by 47.9% to
    $273.6 million in fiscal 2007, from $185.0 million in
    fiscal 2006. Stock-based compensation expense of
    $10.1 million was included in the cost of service revenue
    for fiscal 2007.

The change in service gross margin year over year was primarily
    impacted by an increase in service revenue, improved
    productivity, and continued spending in our service
    infrastructure to support our increasing enterprise customer
    base. This spending included additional professional support
    engineers, increased support center activities, and global
    service partnership programs. Service gross margins will
    typically be impacted by factors such as timing of technical
    support service initiations and renewals and additional
    investments in our customer support infrastructure.

Sales and Marketing

— Sales and marketing
    expense consists primarily of salaries, commissions, advertising
    and promotional expenses, stock-based compensation expense, and
    certain customer service and support costs. Sales and marketing
    expense increased 49.5% to $895.8 million in fiscal 2007,
    from $599.1 million in fiscal 2006. These expenses were
    32.0% and 28.9% of total revenues in fiscal 2007 and fiscal
    2006, respectively. The increase in absolute dollars was
    attributed to increased commission expenses resulting from
    increased revenues, higher payroll expenses due to higher
    profitability, higher partner program expenses, the continued
    worldwide investment in our sales and global service
    organizations associated with selling complete enterprise
    solutions, and stock-based compensation expenses recognized
    under adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

The stock-based compensation expense included in sales and
    marketing expense for fiscal 2007 was $71.7 million
    compared to $4.0 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in
    stock-based compensation expense was due to adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R. Amortization of acquisitions-related
    trademarks/tradenames and customer contracts and relationships
    included in sales and marketing expenses was $2.9 million
    and $2.1 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006,
    respectively.

Research and Development

— Research and
    development expense consists primarily of salaries and benefits,
    stock-based compensation, prototype expenses, nonrecurring
    engineering charges, fees paid to outside consultants, and
    amortization of capitalized patents.

Research and development expense increased 53.3% to
    $385.4 million in fiscal 2007 from $251.3 million in
    fiscal 2006. This expense represented 13.7% and 12.2% of revenue
    for fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in research
    and development expense was primarily a result of increased
    headcount, ongoing operating impact of acquisitions, ongoing
    support of current and future product development and
    enhancement efforts, higher performance-based payroll expenses
    due to higher profitability, and stock-based compensation
    expense recognized under adoption of SFAS No. 123R.
    For both fiscal 2007 and 2006, no software development costs
    were capitalized.

The stock-based compensation expense included in research and
    development expense for fiscal 2007 was $51.3 million
    compared to $8.3 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in
    stock-based compensation expense was due to adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R. Included in research and development
    expense are capitalized patents amortization of
    $2.0 million for both fiscal 2007 and 2006.



General and Administrative

— General and
    administrative expense increased 58.9% to $147.5 million in
    fiscal 2007, from $92.8 million in fiscal 2006. This
    expense represented 5.3% and 4.6% of revenues for fiscal 2007
    and 2006, respectively. The increase in absolute dollars was
    primarily due to higher payroll expenses due to higher
    profitability and increased headcount, higher stock-based
    compensation expense recognized under SFAS No. 123R,
    and higher legal expenses and professional fees for general
    corporate matters.

The stock-based compensation expense included in general and
    administrative expense for fiscal 2007 was $26.2 million
    compared to $1.0 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in
    stock-based compensation expense was due to adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R. Amortization of covenants not to
    compete included in general and administrative expenses was
    $1.0 million and $2.2 million for fiscal 2007 and
    2006, respectively.

Restructuring Charges

— In fiscal 2002, we
    implemented a restructuring plan related to the closure of an
    engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the
    Sunnyvale headquarters. In fiscal 2006, we implemented a
    restructuring plan related to the move of our global services
    center operations from Sunnyvale to our new flagship support
    center at our Research Triangle Park facility in North Carolina.

In fiscal 2007, we did not record any reduction in restructuring
    reserve resulting from a change in estimate for our
    restructuring plans. In fiscal 2006, we recorded a reduction in
    restructuring reserve of $1.3 million resulting from the
    execution of a new sublease agreement for our Tewksbury
    facility. In fiscal 2006, we also recorded a restructuring
    charge of $1.1 million, primarily attributed to
    severance-related amounts and relocation expenses related to our
    2006 restructuring plan. Of the reserve balance at
    April 27, 2007, $0.5 million was included in other
    accrued liabilities, and the remaining $1.6 million was
    classified as long-term obligations.

Gain on Sale of Assets

— We recorded a gain of
    $25.3 million in fiscal 2007 as a result of the sale of
    certain assets of our NetCache product line to Blue Coat. We
    recorded revenues of $57.4 million, $71.1 million and
    $75.5 million from NetCache products for fiscal 2007, 2006,
    and 2005 respectively. The contribution to operating income from
    these products was not significant.

Interest Income

— Interest income was
    $68.8 million and $41.5 million for fiscal 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The increase in interest income was
    primarily driven by higher average interest rates on our
    investment portfolio.

Interest Expense

— Interest expense was
    $11.6 million and $1.3 million in fiscal 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2007 was primarily
    due to interest incurred in connection with our debt.

Net Gain (Loss) on Investments

— Net gain
    (loss) on investments included a net write-down of
    $2.1 million related to the impairment of our investment in
    privately-held companies in fiscal 2007.

Other Income (Expense), Net

— Other income was
    $2.8 million for fiscal 2007. Other income for fiscal 2007
    included net exchange gains from foreign currency of
    $2.4 million and other income of $0.4 million. Other
    income included net exchange gains from foreign currency of
    $1.7 million for fiscal 2006.

Provision for Income Taxes

— For fiscal 2007,
    our annual effective tax rate was 17.2% versus 23.9% for fiscal
    2006, which included a 6.4% increase to account for the income
    tax provision of $22.5 million associated with the cash
    repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings. The decrease to the
    effective tax rate for fiscal year 2007 is primarily
    attributable to the absence of this one-time item and the impact
    of income taxed at lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions. The
    effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 differed from the
    U.S. statutory rate primarily due to reductions in the rate
    derived from a beneficial foreign tax ruling for our principal
    European subsidiary, the availability of tax credits and the
    generation of foreign earnings in lower tax jurisdictions,
    offset partially by an increase in the rate due to the tax
    effect of stock compensation under SFAS No. 123R.

The provision for income taxes for fiscal 2006 included an
    income tax provision of $22.5 million or
    $0.06 per share associated with the repatriation of
    cumulative foreign earnings. This tax raised our 2006 effective
    tax rate by 6.4% under the one-time incentive created pursuant
    to Section 965 of the Jobs Act. We will invest these
    earnings pursuant to an approved Domestic Reinvestment Plan that
    conforms to the Jobs Act guidelines.

The 2006 Tax Relief and Health Care Act was signed into law on
    December 20, 2006. One of the provisions of this law was
    the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development
    credit from January 1, 2006 and its



extension through December 31, 2007. The effective tax
    rates for the fiscal 2007 reflected the benefits attributable to
    the extension of the research and development tax credit
    provisions.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our
    balance sheet and cash flows, contractual obligations and other
    commercial commitments, stock repurchase program, capital
    commitments, and other sources and uses of cash flow on our
    liquidity and capital resources.

Balance
    Sheet and Other Cash Flows

As of April 25, 2008, as compared to April 27, 2007,
    our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments decreased
    by $144.4 million to $1,164.4 million. We derive our
    liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flow
    from operations and from working capital. Working capital
    (Current Assets minus Current Liabilities) decreased by
    $399.9 million to $653.3 million as of April 25,
    2008, compared to $1,053.3 million as of April 27,
    2007 due to higher stock repurchase activities in fiscal 2008.
    In addition, we have classified all of our auction rate
    securities that were not liquidated before April 25, 2008
    from short-term investments to long-term assets in our
    consolidated balance sheet as of April 25, 2008 as our
    ability to liquidate such securities in the next 12 months
    is uncertain.

During fiscal 2008, we generated cash flows from operating
    activities of $1,008.9 million, as compared with
    $864.5 million and $554.3 million for fiscal 2007 and
    fiscal 2006, respectively. We reported net income of
    $309.7 million for fiscal 2008, as compared to
    $297.7 million and $266.5 million in fiscal 2007 and
    fiscal 2006, respectively. A summary of the significant changes
    and noncash adjustments affecting net income and changes in
    assets and liabilities impacting operating cash flows are as
    follows:

•

Stock-based compensation expense was $148.0 million in
    fiscal 2008, compared to $163.0 million and
    $13.3 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    decrease in stock-based compensation in fiscal 2008 compared to
    fiscal 2007 was largely due to our declining stock price year
    over year.

•

Depreciation expense was $115.3 million,
    $87.4 million, and $63.7 million in fiscal 2008, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. The increase was due to continued
    capital expansion to meet our business growth.

•

Amortization of intangibles and patents was $28.9 million,
    $23.4 million, and $18.1 million in fiscal 2008, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. The increase was attributed to
    intangibles related to the newly acquired companies including
    Onaro and Topio.

•

Net gain on sale of investments was $12.6 million for
    fiscal 2008, compared to net loss of $1.5 million for
    fiscal 2007. The gain in fiscal 2008 was related to sale of Blue
    Coat common shares which amounted to $13.6 million, offset
    by a net write-down of $1.0 million for our investments in
    privately-held companies.

•

An increase in deferred revenues of $401.0 million in
    fiscal 2008 was primarily due to increased service sales and
    software entitlements and maintenance revenues. An increase in
    deferred revenue of $421.3 million in fiscal 2007 compared
    to $233.2 million in fiscal 2006, was due to larger
    installed base renewals, upgrades and an increased number of new
    enterprise customers.

•

Increase in other liabilities of $117.5 million in fiscal
    2008 compared to decrease of $0.3 million and
    $1.6 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, was
    primarily due to reclassification of our FIN 48 tax
    liability (see Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements).

•

Increase in accounts payable of $20.0 million,
    $36.6 million and $17.4 million in fiscal 2008, 2007,
    and 2006, respectively, was primarily attributable to elevated
    purchasing activity required to support our business growth and
    facilities expansion projects.

•

Accrued compensation and related benefits increased by
    $18.8 million, $43.6 million and $28.4 million in
    fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, reflecting increased
    headcount and the timing of payroll accruals versus payments.



•

Increase in accounts receivable of $27.7 million in fiscal
    2008 was due to increased shipment levels weighted towards the
    end of the fourth quarter, offset by timing of collections.
    Increase in accounts receivable of $175.2 million and
    $116.8 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively
    were due to higher revenue volume and shipment levels weighted
    toward the end of the fourth quarters in both fiscal years.

•

Net inventory increased $15.4 million in fiscal 2008 due to
    higher inventory to support revenue growth during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2008. Net inventory decreased
    $9.9 million for fiscal 2007, primarily due to higher
    inventory at fiscal 2006 year end associated with the new
    FAS 6000 launch. The increase of $46.2 million in
    fiscal 2006 was due primarily to ramping up of purchased
    components in anticipation of revenue growth.

•

An increase in deferred income taxes of $53.0 million in
    fiscal 2008 was primarily due to an increase in deferred tax
    balances associated with increases in deferred revenue and tax
    benefits associated with stock compensation. The increase of
    $146.0 million in fiscal 2007, as compared to a decrease of
    $1.5 million in fiscal 2006, was primarily due to an
    increase in deferred tax balances associated with increases in
    tax benefits associated with stock compensation and deferred
    revenue.

•

A decrease in income taxes payable of $47.3 million in
    fiscal 2008 compared to an increase of $1.6 million in
    fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to reclassification of
    FIN 48 liability (see Note 8 in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements). An increase in income taxes
    payable in fiscal 2007 compared to an increase of
    $72.7 million in fiscal 2006 was primarily attributable to
    income taxes payments related to the one-time repatriation
    incentive under the Jobs Act. During fiscal 2007, we remitted
    $19.6 million of income taxes relating to the foreign
    dividend repatriation in connection with the filing of our
    fiscal 2006 federal income tax return.

We expect that cash provided by operating activities may
    fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors,
    including fluctuations in our operating results, shipment levels
    and linearity, accounts receivable collections, inventory
    management, and the timing of tax and other payments.

Cash
    Flows from Investing Activities

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 were $188.3 million as
    compared to $165.8 million and $132.9 million in
    fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. We received net proceeds of
    $376.4 million and $187.9 million in fiscal 2008 and
    2007, respectively, and used net proceeds of $128.5 million
    in fiscal 2006, for net purchases and redemptions of short-term
    investments and restricted investments to repay debts with JP
    Morgan (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements). Investing activities in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006
    also included new investments in privately held companies of
    $4.2 million, $1.6 million, and $9.3 million,
    respectively. In fiscal 2008, we acquired Onaro, Inc. and
    incurred total cash payments including related transaction costs
    totaling $99.6 million. In fiscal 2007, we acquired Topio,
    Inc. and incurred total cash payments including related
    transaction costs totaling $131.2 million. In fiscal 2006,
    we acquired Alacritus, Inc. (“Alacritus”) and Decru
    Inc. (“Decru”) and incurred total cash payments
    including related transaction costs totaling $53.7 million.
    In fiscal 2008, we received $0.2 million in connection with
    the escrow from our Topio acquisition. In fiscal 2008, 2007 and
    2006, we received $0.9 million, $2.8 million, and
    $0.1 million, respectively, from the sale of investments in
    privately held companies. In fiscal 2008, we received
    $18.3 million from the sale of shares of Blue Coat common
    stock. In fiscal 2007, we received $23.9 million in cash in
    connection with the sale of certain assets to Blue Coat.

The credit markets have been volatile and have experienced a
    shortage in overall liquidity. As of April 25, 2008,
    auction rate securities with an estimated fair value of
    $72.7 million were recorded in long-term investments. We
    concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment losses
    occurred during fiscal 2008 because we believe that the declines
    in fair value that occurred during fiscal 2008 were due to
    general market conditions. These investments continue to be of
    high credit quality, and we have the intent and ability to hold
    these investments until the anticipated recovery in market value
    occurs. We believe we have sufficient liquidity through cash
    provided by operations and our financing agreements. If the
    global credit market continues to deteriorate, our investment
    portfolio may be impacted and we could determine some of our
    investments are impaired which could adversely impact our
    financial results.



Cash
    Flows from Financing Activities

In fiscal 2008 and 2007, we used $662.4 million and
    $747.3 million, respectively, compared to fiscal 2006, when
    cash from financing activities generated $42.8 million. We
    made repayments of $231.5 million and $214.9 million
    for our debt and revolving credit facility in fiscal 2008 and
    2007, respectively. We repurchased 32.8 million,
    22.6 million and 17.4 million shares of common stock
    for a total of $903.7 million, $805.7 million, and
    $488.9 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    Sales of common stock related to employee stock option exercises
    and employee stock purchases provided $114.7 million,
    $215.5 million and $232.7 million in fiscal 2008, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. Tax benefits, related to tax deductions
    in excess of the stock-based compensation expense recognized, of
    $45.4 million and $63.2 million were presented as
    financing cash flows for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, in
    accordance with SFAS No. 123R. During fiscal 2008,
    2007 and 2006, we withheld shares with an aggregate value of
    $6.0 million, $5.3 million and $1.1 million,
    respectively, in connection with the exercise of certain
    employees’ restricted stock for purposes of satisfying
    those employees’ federal, state, and local withholding tax
    obligations. The increase in the amounts withheld year over year
    was due to the release of restricted stock units assumed in
    connection with acquisitions and increased grants of restricted
    stock units. During fiscal 2008, we borrowed $318.8 million
    through a revolving credit facility for our general corporate
    purposes, including stock repurchases and working capital needs.
    During fiscal 2006, we borrowed $300.0 million to fund the
    repatriation in cash from foreign earnings and investments under
    the Jobs Act.

Net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to
    employee participation in employee stock programs have
    historically been a significant component of our liquidity. The
    extent to which our employees participate in these programs
    generally increases or decreases based upon changes in the
    market price of our common stock. As a result, our cash flow
    resulting from the issuance of common stock related to employee
    participation in employee stock programs will vary. Income tax
    benefits associated with dispositions of employee stock
    transactions has historically been another significant source of
    our liquidity. If stock option exercise patterns change, we may
    receive less cash from stock option exercises and may not
    receive the same level of tax benefits in the future, which
    could cause our cash payments for income taxes to increase. In
    addition, if our stock price declines, we may receive less tax
    benefits, which could also cause our income tax payments to
    increase.

Other
    Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources

For fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, the income tax benefit
    associated with dispositions of employee stock transactions was
    $48.2 million, $175.0 million, and $36.6 million,
    respectively. If stock option exercise patterns change, we may
    receive less cash from stock option exercises and may not
    receive the same level of tax benefits in the future, which
    could cause our cash payments for income taxes to increase.

Stock
    Repurchase Program

At April 25, 2008, $496.2 million remained available
    for future repurchases under plans approved as of that date. The
    stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any
    time.

Credit
    Facilities and Debt

In October 2007, we received proceeds from a secured credit
    agreement totaling $250.0 million with JP Morgan
    Securities Inc. (“JP Morgan Securities”) as sole
    bookrunner and sole lead arranger (“Secured Credit
    Agreement”). The Secured Credit Agreement is used to
    finance general corporate purposes, including stock repurchases
    and working capital needs. See Note 6 of the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. In fiscal 2008, we repaid
    $146.4 million and drew $69.0 million against this
    Secured Credit Agreement. As of April 25, 2008, the
    outstanding balance on the Secured Credit Agreement was
    $172.6 million. The obligations under the Secured Credit
    Agreement are collateralized by certain investments with a value
    totaling $242.6 million as of April 25, 2008. Interest
    on the loans under the Secured Credit Agreement accrues at a
    floating rate based on a base rate in effect from time to time,
    plus a margin. The interest rate at April 25, 2008 was
    2.88%. In accordance with the payment terms of the Secured
    Credit Agreement, interest payments will be approximately
    $5.0 million in fiscal 2009 based on amount outstanding at
    April 25, 2008. As of April 25, 2008, we were in
    compliance with the liquidity and leverage requirements of the
    Secured Credit Agreement.



In March 2006, we received proceeds from a term loan agreement
    totaling $300.0 million to finance a dividend under the
    Jobs Act (“Loan Agreement”). (See Note 6 of the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.) As of April 25, 2008,
    the loan agreement was fully repaid.

In November 2007, we entered into a $250.0 million senior
    unsecured credit agreement (the “Unsecured Credit
    Agreement”) with certain lenders and BNP Paribas, as
    syndication agent, and JP Morgan Chase Bank National
    Association, as administrative agent (See Note 6 of the
    Consolidated Financial Statements,) and as of April 25,
    2008, no amount was outstanding under this facility. However,
    the amounts allocated under the Unsecured Credit Agreement to
    support certain of our outstanding letters of credit amounted to
    $0.5 million as of April 25, 2008.

In June 2008, we issued $1.265 billion of
    1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the
    “Notes”). See Note 17, “Subsequent
    Event” of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We have prepared the following unaudited pro forma summary

For purposes of the above table, contractual obligations for the
    purchase of goods and services are defined as agreements that
    are enforceable, are legally binding on us, and subject us to
    penalties if we cancel the agreement. Some of the figures we
    include in this table are based on management’s estimates
    and assumptions about these obligations, including their
    duration, the possibility of renewal or termination, anticipated
    actions by management and third parties, and other factors.
    Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily
    subjective, our actual future obligations may vary from those
    reflected in the table.

As of April 25, 2008, we have commitments relating to two
    financing, construction, and leasing arrangements with BNP
    Paribas LLC (“BNP”) for office space and a parking
    structure to be located on land in Sunnyvale, California that we
    currently own. These arrangements require us to lease our land
    to BNP for a period of 99 years to construct approximately
    380,000 square feet of office space costing up to
    $113.5 million. After completion of construction, we will
    pay minimum lease payments, which vary based on the LIBOR plus a
    spread or a fixed rate (3.49% and 3.06% for the first and second
    lease, respectively, at April 25, 2008) on the cost of
    the facilities. We began to make lease payments on the first
    building in January 2008 and expect to begin making lease
    payments on the second building in December 2008, respectively,
    for terms of five years. We have the option to renew the leases
    for two consecutive five-year periods upon approval by BNP. Upon
    expiration (or upon any earlier termination) of the lease terms,
    we must elect one of the following options: (i) purchase
    the buildings from BNP for $48.5 million and
    $65.0 million, respectively; (ii) if certain
    conditions are met, arrange for the sale of the buildings by BNP
    to a third party for an amount equal to at least
    $41.2 million and $55.3 million, respectively, and be
    liable for any deficiency between the net proceeds received from
    the third party and such amounts; or (iii) pay BNP
    supplemental payments of $41.2 million and
    $55.3 million, respectively, in which event we may recoup
    some or all of such payment by arranging for a sale of either or
    both buildings by BNP during the ensuing two-year period.

As of April 25, 2008, we have a commitment relating to a
    third financing, construction, and leasing arrangement with BNP
    for facility space to be located on land currently owned by us
    in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. This arrangement
    requires us to lease our land to BNP for a period of
    99 years to construct approximately 120,000 square
    feet for a data center costing up to $61.0 million. After
    completion of construction, we will pay minimum lease payments,
    which vary based on the LIBOR plus a spread (3.06% at
    April 25, 2008) on the cost of the facility. We expect
    to begin making lease payments on the completed buildings in
    January 2009 for a term of five and a half years. We have the
    option to renew the lease for two consecutive five-year periods
    upon approval by BNP. Upon expiration (or upon any earlier
    termination) of the lease term, we must elect one of the
    following options: (i) purchase the building from BNP for
    $61.0 million; (ii) if certain conditions are met,
    arrange for the sale of the building by BNP to a third party for
    an amount equal to at least $51.9 million, and be liable
    for any deficiency between the net proceeds received from the
    third party and $51.9 million; or (iii) pay BNP a
    supplemental payment of $51.9 million, in which event we
    may recoup some or all of such payment by arranging for the sale
    of the building by BNP during the ensuing two-year period.

As of April 25, 2008, we have a commitment relating to a
    fourth financing and operating leasing arrangement with BNP for
    approximately 374,274 square feet of buildings located in
    Sunnyvale, California costing up to $101.1 million. This
    arrangement requires us to pay minimum lease payments, which may
    vary based on the LIBOR plus a spread or a fixed rate (3.47% and
    3.49% for the first two buildings, and 3.06% for the third
    building at April 25, 2008). We began to make lease
    payments on two buildings in December 2007 and the third
    building in January 2008 for terms of five years. We have the
    option to renew the leases for two consecutive five-year periods
    upon approval by BNP. Upon expiration (or upon any earlier
    termination) of the lease terms, we must elect one of the
    following options: (i) purchase the buildings from BNP for
    $101.1 million; (ii) if certain conditions are met,
    arrange for the sale of the buildings by BNP to a third party
    for an amount equal to at least $85.9 million, and be
    liable for any deficiency between the net proceeds received from
    the third party and $85.9 million; or (iii) pay BNP a
    supplemental payment of $85.9 million, in which event we
    may recoup some or all of such payment by arranging for the sale
    of the buildings by BNP during the ensuing two-year period.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we entered into a
    fifth financing, construction, and leasing arrangement with BNP
    for facility space to be located on land currently owned by us
    in Sunnyvale, California. This arrangement requires us to lease
    our land to BNP for a period of 99 years to construct
    approximately 189,697 square feet for a data center costing
    up to $49.0 million. After completion of construction, we
    will pay minimum lease payments, which vary based on the LIBOR
    plus a spread (3.06% at April 25, 2008) on the cost of
    the facility. We expect to begin making lease payments on the
    completed building in January 2010 for a term of five years. We
    have the option to renew the lease for two consecutive five-year
    periods upon approval by BNP. Upon expiration (or upon any
    earlier termination) of the lease term, we must elect one of the
    following options: (i) purchase the building from BNP for
    $49.0 million; (ii) if certain conditions are met,
    arrange for the sale of the



building by BNP to a third party for an amount equal to at least
    $41.6 million, and be liable for any deficiency between the
    net proceeds received from the third party and
    $41.6 million; or (iii) pay BNP a supplemental payment
    of $41.6 million, in which event we may recoup some or all
    of such payment by arranging for the sale of the building by BNP
    during the ensuing two-year period.

All leases require us to maintain specified financial covenants
    with which we were in compliance as of April 25, 2008. Such
    specified financial covenants include a maximum ratio of Total
    Debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and
    Amortization (“EBITDA”) and a minimum amount of
    Unencumbered Cash and Short Term Investments.

Legal
    Contingencies

On September 5, 2007, we filed a patent infringement
    lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory
    damages and a permanent injunction against Sun Microsystems. On
    October 25, 2007, Sun Microsystems filed a counter claim
    against us in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory
    damages and a permanent injunction. On October 29, 2007,
    Sun filed a second lawsuit against us in the Northern District
    of California asserting additional patents against us. The Texas
    court granted a joint motion to transfer the Texas lawsuit to
    the Northern District of California on November 26, 2007.
    On March 26, 2008, Sun filed a third lawsuit in federal
    court that extends the patent infringement charges to storage
    management technology we acquired in January 2008. We are unable
    at this time to determine the likely outcome of these various
    patent litigations. In addition, as we are unable to reasonably
    estimate the amount or range of the potential settlement, no
    accrual has been recorded as of April 25, 2008.

We received a subpoena from the Office of Inspector General for
    the General Services Administration (“GSA”) seeking
    various records relating to GSA contracting activity by us
    during the period beginning in 1995 and ending in 2005. The
    subpoena is part of an investigation being conducted by GSA and
    the Department of Justice regarding potential violations of the
    False Claims Act in connection with our GSA contracting
    activity. The subpoena requested a range of documents including
    documents relating to our discount practices and compliance with
    the price reduction clause provisions of its GSA contracts. We
    are cooperating with the investigation and have produced
    documents and met with the Department of Justice on several
    occasions. Violations of the False Claims Act could result in
    the imposition of a damage remedy which includes treble damages
    plus civil penalties, and could also result in us being
    suspended or debarred from future government contracting, any or
    a combination of which could have a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations or financial condition. However, as
    the investigation is still ongoing and we are unable at this
    time to determine the likely outcome of this matter, no
    provision has been recorded as of April 25, 2008.

In addition, we are subject to various legal proceedings and
    claims which have arisen or may arise in the normal course of
    business. While the outcome of these legal matters is currently
    not determinable, we do not believe that any current litigation
    or claims will have a material adverse effect on our business,
    cash flow, operating results, or financial condition.

Capital
    Expenditure Requirements

We expect capital expenditures to increase in the future
    consistent with the growth in our business, as we continue to
    invest in people, land, buildings, capital equipment, and
    enhancements to our worldwide infrastructure. We expect that our
    existing facilities and those being developed in Sunnyvale,
    California; Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; and
    worldwide are adequate for our requirements over at least the
    next two years and that additional space will be available as
    needed. We expect to finance these construction projects,
    including our commitments under facilities and equipment
    operating leases, and any required capital expenditures over the
    next few years through cash from operations and existing cash,
    cash equivalents and investments.

Credit
    Environment

The credit markets have been volatile and have experienced a
    shortage in overall liquidity. We believe we have sufficient
    liquidity through cash provided by operations and our financing
    agreements. If the global credit market continues to
    deteriorate, our investment portfolio may be impacted and we
    could determine some of our investments



have experienced other-than-temporary declines in fair value
    which could adversely impact our financial results. In addition,
    some of our sales are derived from customers in the financial
    services industry, which is experiencing a downturn. We believe
    that our diversified customer base should mitigate our exposure
    to any one industry; however, we remain exposed to overall
    reductions in spending by our customer base.

See further discussion under Item 1A — Risk
    Factors, “We are exposed to fluctuations in the market
    values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates.”

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

As of April 25, 2008, our financial guarantees of
    $3.2 million that were not recorded on our balance sheet
    consisted of standby letters of credit related to workers’
    compensation, a customs guarantee, a corporate credit card
    program, and foreign rent guarantees.

As of April 25, 2008, our notional fair value of foreign
    exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled
    $419.3 million. We do not believe that these derivatives
    present significant credit risks, because the counterparties to
    the derivatives consist of major financial institutions, and we
    manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any
    one counterparty. We do not enter into derivative financial
    instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Other than the
    risk associated with the financial condition of the
    counterparties, our maximum exposure related to foreign currency
    forward and option contracts is limited to the premiums paid.

We have entered into indemnification agreements with third
    parties in the ordinary course of business. Generally, these
    indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses
    suffered by the third party due to various events, such as
    lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement. These
    indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet
    arrangements in accordance with FASB Interpretation 45, of
    FIN No. 45,

“Guarantor’s Accounting and
    Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
    Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.”

We have commitments related to five lease arrangements with BNP
    for approximately 1,063,971 square feet of office space and
    a parking structure for our headquarters in Sunnyvale,
    California and a data center in Research Triangle Park, North
    Carolina (as further described above under “Contractual
    Obligations”).

We have evaluated our accounting for these leases under the
    provisions of FIN No. 46R and have determined the
    following:

•

BNP is a leasing company for BNP Paribas in the United States.
    BNP is not a “special purpose entity” organized for
    the sole purpose of facilitating the leases to us. The
    obligation to absorb expected losses and receive expected
    residual returns rests with the parent, BNP Paribas. Therefore,
    we are not the primary beneficiary of BNP as we do not absorb
    the majority of BNP’s expected losses or expected residual
    returns; and

•

BNP has represented in the Closing Agreement (filed as
    Exhibit 10.40) that the fair value of the property leased
    to us by BNP is less than half of the total of the fair values
    of all assets of BNP, excluding any assets of BNP held within a
    silo. Further, the property leased to NetApp is not held within
    a silo. The definition of “held within a silo” means
    that BNP has obtained funds equal to or in excess of 95% of the
    fair value of the leased asset to acquire or maintain its
    investment in such asset through nonrecourse financing or other
    contractual arrangements, the effect of which is to leave such
    asset (or proceeds thereof) as the only significant asset of BNP
    at risk for the repayment of such funds.

Accordingly, under the current FIN No. 46R standard,
    we are not required to consolidate either the leasing entity or
    the specific assets that we lease under the BNP lease. Our
    future minimum lease payments and residual guarantees under
    these real estates leases will amount to a total of
    $326.2 million reported under our Note 4,
    “Commitments and Contingencies.”

Liquidity
    and Capital Resource Requirements

Key factors affecting our cash flows include our ability to
    effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts
    receivable and inventories and future demand for our products
    and related pricing. We expect to incur



higher capital expenditures in the future to expand our
    operations. We will from time to time acquire products and
    businesses complementary to our business. In the future, we may
    continue to repurchase our common stock, which would reduce
    cash, cash equivalents,

and/or

short-term investments available to fund future operations and
    meet other liquidity requirements. Based on past performance and
    current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash
    equivalents, short-term investments, cash generated from
    operations, and credit facilities will satisfy our working
    capital needs, capital expenditures, stock repurchases,
    contractual obligations, and other liquidity requirements
    associated with our operations for at least the next twelve
    months. However, should we need to investigate other financing
    alternatives, we cannot be certain that additional financing
    will be available on satisfactory terms.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in
    interest rates, market prices, and foreign currency exchange
    rates. We use certain derivative financial instruments to manage
    these risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for
    speculative or trading purposes. All financial instruments are
    used in accordance with management-approved policies.

Market
    Risk and Market Interest Risk

Investment and Interest Income

— As of
    April 25, 2008, we had available-for-sale investments of
    $543.2 million, which included restricted investments in
    connection with our credit facility. Our investment portfolio
    primarily consists of investments with original maturities at
    the date of purchase of greater than three months, which are
    classified as available-for-sale. These investments, consisting
    primarily of corporate bonds, corporate securities, government,
    municipal debt securities, and auction-rate securities, are
    subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will
    decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A
    hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates
    from levels at April 25, 2008 would cause the fair value of
    these available-for-sale investments to decline by approximately
    $2.1 million. Because we have the ability to hold these
    investments until maturity, we would not expect any significant
    decline in value of our investments caused by market interest
    rate changes. Declines in interest rates over time will,
    however, reduce our interest income. We do not use derivative
    financial instruments in our investment portfolio.

We are also exposed to market risk relating to our long-term
    investments in auction rate securities due to uncertainties in
    the credit and capital markets. As of April 25, 2008, our
    long term investments of $83.9 million include fair value
    of auction rate securities (ARS) in the amount of
    $72.7 million. During fiscal 2008, we determined that there
    was a decline in the fair value of our ARS investments of
    approximately $3.5 million and recorded a temporary
    impairment charge. The fair value of our auction rate securities
    may change significantly due to events and conditions in the
    credit and capital markets. While these ARS had credit ratings
    of AAA and Aaa at time of purchase, these securities/issuers
    could be subject to review for possible downgrade. Any downgrade
    in these credit ratings may result in additional decline in
    estimated fair value of our auction rate securities. Changes in
    the various assumptions used to value these securities and any
    increase in the markets’ perceived risk associated with
    such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair
    value. If the current market conditions deteriorate further, or
    the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur, we may
    be required to record additional unrealized losses in other
    comprehensive income (loss) or impairment charges to earnings in
    future quarters. We intend and have the ability to hold these
    auction rate securities until the market recovers. We do not
    believe that the lack of liquidity relating to our ARS
    investments will impact our ability to fund working capital
    needs, capital expenditures or other operating requirements.

Our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through
    diversification and investment in highly rated securities. We
    further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our
    investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities
    of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies
    and type of issuer. We actively review, along with our
    investment advisors, current investment ratings, company
    specific events, and general economic conditions in managing our
    investments and in determining whether there is a significant
    decline in fair value that is other-than-temporary. We have not
    experienced any material losses on our available-for-sale
    investments. To the extent we determine that a decline in fair
    value is other-than-temporary, the associated investment is
    valued at current fair value and an impairment charge is
    reflected in earnings.



Lease Commitments

— As of April 25, 2008,
    we have three arrangements with BNP to lease our land for a
    period of 99 years to construct approximately
    569,697 square feet of office space and a parking structure
    costing up to $162.5 million. We also have a fourth
    arrangement with BNP to lease our land for a period of
    99 years to construct approximately 120,000 square
    feet of data center costing up to $61.0 million for a term
    of five and a half years. After completion of construction, we
    will pay minimum lease payments which vary based on the LIBOR
    plus a spread. In the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we entered
    into an additional financing and operating leasing arrangements
    with BNP to lease approximately 374,274 square feet of
    three buildings located in Sunnyvale, California for
    $101.1 million for a term of five years. We have the option
    to renew these leases for two consecutive five-year periods upon
    approval by BNP. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in
    market interest rates from levels at April 25, 2008 would
    increase our total lease payments under the initial five-year
    term by approximately $3.5 million. We do not currently
    hedge against market interest rate increases. As additional cash
    flow generated from operations is invested at current market
    rates, it will offer a natural hedge against interest rate risk
    from our lease commitments in the event of a significant change
    in market interest rate.

Debt Obligation

— We have an outstanding
    Secured Credit Agreement totaling $172.6 million as of
    April 25, 2008. Under the terms of this arrangement, we
    expect to make interest payments at LIBOR plus a spread. A
    hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates
    from levels at April 25, 2008 would increase our total
    interest payments by approximately $2.5 million. We do not
    currently use derivatives to manage interest rate risk for this
    arrangement. As additional cash flow generated from operations
    is invested at current market rates, it will offer a natural
    hedge against interest rate risk from our debt in the event of a
    significant change in market interest rate.

Nonmarketable securities

— We have from time to
    time made cash investments in companies with distinctive
    technologies that are potentially strategically important to us.
    Our investments in nonmarketable securities would be negatively
    affected by an adverse change in equity market prices, although
    the impact cannot be directly quantified. Such a change, or any
    negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the
    companies whose nonmarketable securities we own, would harm the
    ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the
    likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of
    our investments through liquidity events such as initial public
    offerings, acquisitions, and private sales. These types of
    investments involve a high degree of risk, and there can be no
    assurance that any company we invest in will grow or be
    successful. We do not currently engage in any hedging activities
    to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to such
    nonmarketable investments. Accordingly, we could lose all or
    part of these investments if there is an adverse change in the
    market price of a company we invest in. Our investments in
    nonmarketable securities had a carrying amount of
    $11.2 million as of April 25, 2008 and
    $8.9 million as of April 27, 2007. If we determine
    that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value exists for a
    nonmarketable equity security, we write down the investments to
    their fair value and record the related write-down as an
    investment loss in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward
    Contracts

We hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to
    minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates on earnings. We utilize forward and option contracts to
    hedge against the short-term impact of foreign currency
    fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in
    foreign currencies. All balance sheet hedges are marked to
    market through earnings every period. We also use foreign
    exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted
    transactions related to certain sales and operating expenses.
    These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under
    SFAS No. 133. For cash flow hedges outstanding at
    April 25, 2008, the gains or losses were included in other
    comprehensive income.

We do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative
    or trading purposes. In entering into forward and option foreign
    exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise
    from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms
    of their contracts. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit
    risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy
    multinational commercial banks. All contracts have a maturity of
    less than one year.

Item 8.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

NetApp, Inc.

Sunnyvale, California

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    NetApp, Inc. (formerly “Network Appliance, Inc.”) and
    subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of
    April 25, 2008 and April 27, 2007, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, cash flows and
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss) for
    each of the three years in the period ended April 25, 2008.
    Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement
    schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These
    financial statements and the financial statement schedule are
    the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
    statements and the financial statement schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    NetApp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of April 25, 2008 and
    April 27, 2007, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    April 25, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
    opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
    a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, (1) in the year ended April 25, 2008, the
    Company changed its method of measuring and recognizing tax
    benefits associated with uncertain tax positions in accordance
    with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation
    No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

and (2) in the year ended April 27,
    2007, the Company changed its method of accounting for
    stock-based compensation in accordance with guidance provided in
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
    (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    April 25, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated June 24, 2008 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except per-share
    data)

1.

The
    Company

Based in Sunnyvale, California, NetApp, Inc. (“we” or
    “the Company”) was incorporated in California in
    April 1992 and reincorporated in Delaware in November 2001;
    in March 2008, the company changed its name from Network
    Appliance, Inc. The Company is a supplier of enterprise storage
    and data management software and hardware products and services.
    Our solutions help global enterprises meet major information
    technology challenges such as managing storage growth, assuring
    secure and timely information access, protecting data and
    controlling costs by providing innovative solutions that
    simplify the complexity associated with managing corporate data.

2.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Fiscal Year

— We operate on a 52-week or
    53-week year ending on the last Friday in April. Fiscal 2008,
    2007, and 2006 were all 52-week fiscal years.

Basis of Presentation

— The consolidated
    financial statements include the Company and its wholly-owned
    subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions are
    eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassification

— In the first quarter of
    fiscal 2008, we began to classify sales-related tax receivable
    balances from our customers within prepaid expenses and other
    current assets. These balances were included in accounts
    receivable, net, in previous periods ($43,075 at April 27,
    2007), and such amounts have been reclassified in the
    accompanying financial statements to conform to the current
    period classification. This reclassification had no effect on
    the reported amounts of net income or cash flow from operations
    for any period presented. In addition, we have chosen to use the
    term “software entitlements and maintenance” in our
    statements of income to describe the arrangements under which we
    provide our customers the right to receive unspecified software
    product upgrades and enhancements on a

when-and-if-available

basis, bug fixes, and patch releases; these were previously
    described as “software upgrade and maintenance.”

Risk and Uncertainties

— There are no
    concentrations of business transacted with a particular customer
    nor concentrations of sales from a particular market or
    geographic area that would severely impact our business in the
    near term. However, we currently rely on a limited number of
    suppliers for certain key components and a few key contract
    manufacturers to manufacture most of our products; any
    disruption or termination of these arrangements could materially
    adversely affect our operating results.

Comprehensive Income

— Comprehensive income is
    defined as the change in equity during a period from nonowner
    sources. Comprehensive income consists of net income and other
    comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss)
    includes foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized
    gain and losses on derivatives and unrealized gains and losses
    on our available-for-sale securities, which includes a temporary
    impairment charge of $3,500 in fiscal 2008 associated with our
    auction rate securities. Refer to Note 3 for further
    discussion regarding this unrealized loss.

Other comprehensive income for the fiscal years 2008, 2007, and
    2006 has been disclosed within the consolidated statement of
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss).



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— We consider all
    highly liquid debt investments with original maturities of three
    months or less to be cash equivalents at time of purchase.

Available-for-Sale Investments

—
    Available-for-sale investments with original maturities of
    greater than three months are classified as short-term
    investments as these investments generally consist of highly
    marketable securities that are intended to be available to meet
    current cash requirements. As of April 25, 2008, all
    marketable securities held by us are classified as
    available-for-sale and our entire auction rate securities
    portfolio is classified as long-term investments.
    Available-for-sale investments are carried at fair market value,
    and unrealized gains or losses are recorded, net of taxes in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a
    separate component of stockholders’ equity. Any gains or
    losses on sales of investments are computed based upon specific
    identification. For all periods presented, realized gains and
    losses on available-for-sale investments were not material.
    Management determines the appropriate classification of debt and
    equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the
    classification at each reporting date. The fair value of our
    available-for-sale investments, including those included in
    restricted investments, was $543,226 and $935,762 as of
    April 25, 2008, and April 27, 2007, respectively.

Restricted Investments

— We have
    available-for-sale investments that are pledged as collateral
    pursuant to the secured credit agreement (the “Secured
    Credit Agreement”) entered into with JPMorgan
    Securities Inc. (“JPMorgan Securities”) as sole
    bookrunner and sole lead arranger. As of April 25, 2008,
    investments of $242,613 were classified as long-term restricted
    investments within the Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance
    with the investment maturity and loan repayment schedule. As of
    April 27, 2007, investments of $116,060 were classified as
    short-term restricted investments in connection with the loan
    agreement entered with JPMorgan, as administrative agent (the
    “Loan Agreement”), within the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets in accordance with the investment maturity and loan
    repayment schedule. There was no short-term restricted
    investment as of April 25, 2008 and no long-term restricted
    investment as of April 27, 2007.

Investments in Nonpublic Companies

— We have
    certain investments in nonpublicly- traded companies in which we
    have less than 20% of the voting rights and in which we do not
    exercise significant influence and accordingly, we account for
    these investments under the cost method. As of April 25,
    2008, and April 27, 2007, $11,169 and $8,932 of these
    investments are included in long-term investments and restricted
    cash on the balance sheet. We perform periodic reviews of our
    investments for impairment.

Other-than-temporary Impairment

— All of our
    available-for-sale investments and nonmarketable equity
    securities are subject to a periodic impairment review.
    Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair
    value is judged to be other-than-temporary. This determination
    requires significant judgment. For publicly traded investments,
    impairment is determined based upon the specific facts and
    circumstances present at the time, including factors such as
    current economic and market conditions, the credit rating of the
    security’s issuer, the length of time an investment’s
    fair value has been below our carrying value, and our ability to
    hold investments to maturity or until recovery. If an
    investment’s decline in fair value, caused by factors other
    than changes in interest rates, is deemed to be
    other-than-temporary, we would reduce its carrying value to its
    estimated fair value, as determined based on quoted market
    prices or liquidation values. Declines in value judged to be
    other-than-temporary, if any, are recorded in operations as
    incurred. For long term investments such as auction rate
    securities,



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

impairment is determined based on fair value and marketability
    of these investments. The valuation models we used to estimate
    fair value included numerous assumptions such as assessments of
    the underlying structure of each security, expected cash flows,
    discount rates, credit ratings, workout periods, and overall
    capital market liquidity. For nonmarketable equity securities,
    the impairment analysis requires the identification of events or
    circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse
    effect on the fair value of the investment, including revenue
    and earnings trends, overall business prospects, limited capital
    resources, limited prospects of receiving additional financing,
    limited prospects for liquidity of the related securities and
    general market conditions in the investees’ industry.

Inventories

— Inventories are stated at the
    lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out basis) or market. Cost components include materials,
    labor, and manufacturing overhead costs. We write down inventory
    and record purchase commitment liabilities for excess and
    obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of
    inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions
    about future demand and market conditions.

Property and Equipment

— Property and equipment
    are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets, which range from three to five years. The land at our
    Sunnyvale headquarters site and at Research Triangle Park
    (“RTP”), North Carolina, is not depreciated but is
    reviewed for impairment similar to our review of goodwill and
    intangible assets discussed below. Leasehold improvements are
    amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the
    assets or the remaining term of the lease. Building improvements
    are amortized over the estimated lives of the assets, which
    range from 10 to 40 years. Construction in progress will be
    amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective
    assets when they are ready for their intended use.

We review the carrying values of long-lived assets whenever
    events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an
    asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows
    from its use and eventual disposition. The amount of impairment
    loss, if any, is measured as the difference between the net book
    value and the estimated fair value of the asset.

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

—
    Goodwill and identifiable intangibles are accounted for in
    accordance with SFAS No. 141,

“Business
    Combinations,”

and SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

We
    record goodwill and identifiable intangibles related to
    acquisitions and evaluate these items for impairment on an
    annual basis, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable. If an
    evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash
    flows associated with these assets is compared to their carrying
    amount to determine if a write-down to fair market value or
    discounted cash flow value is required. We performed an annual
    impairment test of goodwill as of February 22, 2008, and
    February 23, 2007, respectively, and found no impairment.

Purchased intangible assets include patents, existing
    technologies, trademarks, tradenames, customer
    contracts/relationships and covenants not to compete, which are
    carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization of
    purchased intangible assets is computed using the straight-line
    method over estimated useful lives of the assets, which range
    from 18 months to eight years. See Note 14,
    “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets.”

Revenue Recognition

— We apply the provisions
    of Statement of Position (“SOP”)

No. 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,”

and related
    interpretations to our product sales, both hardware and
    software, because our software is essential to the performance
    of our hardware. We recognize revenue when:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists:

It is our customary practice to have a
    purchase order

and/or

contract prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement from our
    end users, customers, value-added resellers, or distributors.

•

Delivery has occurred:

Our product is
    physically delivered to our customers, generally with standard
    transfer terms such as FOB origin. We typically do not allow for
    restocking rights with any of our value-



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

added resellers or distributors. Products shipped with
    acceptance criteria or return rights are not recognized as
    revenue until all criteria are achieved. If undelivered products
    or services exist that are essential to the functionality of the
    delivered product in an arrangement, delivery is not considered
    to have occurred.

•

The fee is fixed or determinable:

Arrangements
    with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms,
    conditions, and practices are not considered to be fixed or
    determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized as
    the fees become due and payable. We typically do not allow for
    price-protection rights with any of our value-added resellers or
    distributors.

•

Collection is probable:

Probability of
    collection is assessed on a

customer-by-customer

basis. Customers are subjected to a credit review process that
    evaluates the customers’ financial position and ultimately
    their ability to pay. If it is determined at the outset of an
    arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our
    review process, revenue is recognized upon cash receipt.

Our multiple element arrangements include our systems and one or
    more of the following undelivered software-related elements:
    software entitlements and maintenance, premium hardware
    maintenance, and storage review services. Our software
    entitlements and maintenance entitle our customers to receive
    unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a

when-and-if-available

basis, bug fixes, and patch releases. Premium hardware
    maintenance services include contracts for technical support and
    minimum response times. Revenues from software entitlements and
    maintenance, premium hardware maintenance services and storage
    review services are recognized ratably over the contractual
    term, generally from one to three years. Standard hardware
    warranty costs are considered an obligation under
    SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

and
    expensed as a cost of service when revenue is recognized; such
    costs were $26,997 in fiscal 2008, $22,082 in fiscal 2007, and
    $18,532 in fiscal 2006. We also offer extended service contracts
    (which extend our standard parts warranty and may include
    premium hardware maintenance) at the end of the warranty term;
    revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over the
    contract term. We typically sell technical consulting services
    separately from any of our other revenue elements, either on a
    time and materials basis or for fixed price standard projects;
    we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed.
    Revenue from hardware installation services is recognized at the
    time of delivery and any remaining costs are accrued, as the
    remaining undelivered services are considered to be
    inconsequential and perfunctory. For arrangements with multiple
    elements, we recognize as revenue the difference between the
    total arrangement price and the greater of fair value or stated
    price for any undelivered elements (“the residual
    method”).

For our undelivered software-related elements, we apply the
    provisions of

SOP No. 97-2

and determine fair value of these undelivered elements based on
    vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”), which for
    us consists of the prices charged when these services are sold
    separately either alone, in the case of software entitlements
    and maintenance, or as a bundled element which always includes
    software entitlements and maintenance and premium hardware
    maintenance, and may also include storage review services. To
    determine the fair value of these elements, we analyze both the
    selling prices when elements are sold separately as well as the
    concentrations of those prices. We believe those concentrations
    have been sufficient to enable us to establish VSOE of fair
    value for the undelivered elements. If VSOE cannot be obtained
    to establish fair value of the undelivered elements,
    paragraph 12 of

SOP No. 97-2

would require that revenue from the entire arrangement be
    initially deferred and recognized ratably over the period these
    elements are delivered.

For income statement presentation purposes, once fair value has
    been determined for our undelivered bundled elements, we
    allocate revenue first to software entitlements and maintenance,
    based on VSOE of its fair value with the remainder allocated
    other service revenues.

We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at
    the time of shipment. Sales returns are estimated based on
    historical sales returns, current trends, and our expectations
    regarding future experience. We monitor and analyze the accuracy
    of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and
    adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of
    our current and future reserve needs. If actual future returns
    and allowances differ from past experience, additional
    allowances may be required.



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for
    estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility
    of specific customer accounts and the aging of our accounts
    receivable. We analyze accounts receivable and historical bad
    debts, customer concentrations, customer solvency, current
    economic and geographic trends, and changes in customer payment
    terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of the
    allowance for doubtful accounts. Our allowance for doubtful
    accounts as of April 25, 2008, was $2,439, compared to
    $2,572 as of April 27, 2007. If the financial condition of
    our customers deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their
    ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

Deferred Revenues

— Deferred revenues consist
    primarily of amounts related to software entitlements and
    maintenance, service contracts and other service described in
    revenue recognition above.

Software Development Costs

— The costs for the
    development of new software products and substantial
    enhancements to existing software products are expensed as
    incurred until technological feasibility has been established,
    at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in
    accordance with SFAS No. 86,

“Accounting for
    the Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
    Marketed.”

Because we believe our current process for
    developing software is essentially completed concurrently with
    the establishment of technological feasibility, which occurs
    upon the completion of a working model, no costs have been
    capitalized for any of the periods presented. In accordance with

SOP No. 98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed
    or Obtained for Internal Use,”

the cost of internally
    developed software is capitalized and included in property and
    equipment at the point at which the conceptual formulation,
    design, and testing of possible software project alternatives
    have been completed and management authorizes and commits to
    funding the project. Pilot projects and projects where expected
    future economic benefits are less than probable are not
    capitalized. Internally developed software costs include the
    cost of software tools and licenses used in the development of
    our systems, as well as consulting costs. Completed projects are
    transferred to property and equipment at cost and are amortized
    on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives,
    generally three years. We did not capitalize any software
    development costs in fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006.

Income Taxes

— Deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities are provided for temporary differences that will
    result in future tax deductions or income in future periods, as
    well as the future benefit of tax credit carryforwards. A
    valuation allowance reduces tax assets to their estimated
    realizable value. In years prior to fiscal 2006,
    U.S. income taxes were not provided on that portion of
    unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were expected
    to be reinvested indefinitely. The American Jobs Creation Act
    created a one-time incentive for U.S. corporations to
    repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85%
    dividend-received deduction for certain dividends from certain

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we repatriated
    $405,500 of accumulated foreign earnings and recorded a $22,500
    federal and state income tax liability upon the remittance of
    those foreign earnings. As of our fiscal years ended
    April 25, 2008 and April 27, 2007, the amount of
    accumulated unremitted earnings from our foreign subsidiaries
    considered to be reinvested indefinitely under Accounting
    Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 23,

“Accounting for Income Taxes — Special
    Areas”

was approximately $677,200 and $330,000,
    respectively.

Determining the liability for uncertain tax positions requires
    us to make significant estimates and judgments as to whether,
    and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due based on
    potential tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax
    jurisdictions throughout the world. Our estimates are based on
    the outcomes of previous audits, as well as the precedents set
    in cases in which others have taken similar tax positions to
    those taken by us. If we later determine that our exposure is
    lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our
    revised expectations, we adjust the liability and effect a
    related change in our tax provision during the period in which
    we make such a determination.

Effective April 28, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation
    (“FIN”) No. 48,

“Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109.”

FIN No. 48
    prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should
    recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial
    statements uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect
    to take on a tax return (including a decision whether to file or
    not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction).
    FIN No. 48 is applicable to all uncertain tax
    positions for taxes accounted for under



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income
    Taxes,”

and substantially changes the applicable
    accounting model. There was no cumulative effect from the
    adoption of FIN No. 48. As a result of the
    implementation of FIN No. 48, we recognize the tax
    liability for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax
    return based on the two-step process prescribed in the
    interpretation. The first step is to determine whether it is
    more likely than not that each income tax position would be
    sustained upon audit. The second step is to estimate and measure
    the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than 50%
    likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the
    tax authority. Estimating these amounts requires us to determine
    the probability of various possible outcomes. We evaluate these
    uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. See
    “Note 8, Income Taxes,” for further discussion.

Foreign Currency Translation

— For subsidiaries
    whose functional currency is the local currency, gains and
    losses resulting from translation of these foreign currency
    financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded within
    stockholders’ equity as part of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries where the
    functional currency is the U.S. dollar, gains and losses
    resulting from the process of remeasuring foreign currency
    financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in
    other income (expenses), net.

Derivative Instruments

— We follow
    SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”

as amended.
    Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to
    fair value through earnings. If the derivative is designated as
    a hedge, depending on the nature of the exposure being hedged,
    changes in fair value will either be offset against the change
    in fair value of the hedged items through earnings or recognized
    in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is
    recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedge is
    recognized in earnings immediately. For all periods presented,
    realized gains and losses on the ineffective portion of our
    hedges were not material.

As a result of our significant international operations, we are
    subject to risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates. We
    use derivative financial instruments, principally currency
    forward contracts and currency options, to attempt to minimize
    the impact of exchange rate movements on our balance sheet and
    operating results. Factors that could have an impact on the
    effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of
    forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets. These
    programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the
    impact of currency exchange movements. The maturities of these
    instruments are generally less than one year.

Currently, we do not enter into any foreign exchange forward
    contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments or
    nonmarketable investments. Our major foreign currency exchange
    exposures and related hedging programs are described below:

Balance Sheet.

We utilize foreign currency
    forward and options contracts to hedge exchange rate
    fluctuations related to certain foreign assets and liabilities.
    Gains and losses on these derivatives offset gains and losses on
    the assets and liabilities being hedged and the net amount is
    included in earnings. In fiscal 2008, net gains generated by
    hedged assets and liabilities totaled $12,752, which were offset
    by losses on the related derivative instruments of $13,487. In
    fiscal 2007, net gains generated by hedged assets and
    liabilities totaled $5,180, which were offset by losses on the
    related derivative instruments of $2,829. In fiscal 2006, net
    gains generated by hedged assets and liabilities totaled $3,505,
    which were offset by losses on the related derivative
    instruments of $1,681.

The premiums paid on the foreign currency option contracts are
    recognized as a reduction to other income when the contract is
    entered into. Other than the risk associated with the financial
    condition of the counterparties, our maximum exposure related to
    foreign currency options is limited to the premiums paid.

Forecasted Transactions.

We use currency
    forward contracts to hedge exposures related to forecasted sales
    and operating expenses denominated in certain foreign
    currencies. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges
    and in general closely match the underlying forecasted
    transactions in duration. The contracts are carried on the
    balance sheet at fair value, and the effective portion of the
    contracts’ gains and losses is recorded as other
    comprehensive income (loss) until the forecasted transaction
    occurs.



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

If the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur, or it
    becomes probable that they will not occur, the gain or loss on
    the related cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in
    earnings. For fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, we did not
    record any gains or losses related to forecasted transactions
    that did not occur or became improbable.

We measure the effectiveness of hedges of forecasted
    transactions on at least a quarterly basis by comparing the fair
    values of the designated currency forward contracts with the
    fair values of the forecasted transactions. No ineffectiveness
    was recognized in earnings during fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006.

As of April 25, 2008, the notional fair value of foreign
    exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled
    $419,264.

We do not believe that these derivatives present significant
    credit risks, because the counterparties to the derivatives
    consist of major financial institutions, and we manage the
    notional amount of contracts entered into with any one
    counterparty. We do not enter into derivative financial
    instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of the
    consolidated financial statements is in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles and requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
    statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not
    limited to, revenue recognition and allowances; allowance for
    doubtful accounts; valuation of goodwill and intangibles; fair
    value of derivative instruments and related hedged items;
    accounting for income taxes; inventory valuation and contractual
    commitments; restructuring accruals; impairment losses on
    investments; fair value of options granted under our stock-based
    compensation plans; and loss contingencies. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates.

Concentration of Credit Risk and Allowance for Doubtful
    Accounts

— Financial instruments that potentially
    subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of
    cash equivalents, short-term investments, foreign exchange
    contracts and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and
    short-term investments consist primarily of corporate bonds,
    U.S. government agencies, and money market funds, all of
    which are considered high investment grade. Our policy is to
    limit the amount of credit exposure through diversification and
    investment in highly rated securities. We further mitigate
    concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our
    investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by
    diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer. In
    entering into forward foreign exchange contracts, we have
    assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of
    counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The
    counterparties to these contracts are major multinational
    commercial banks, and we do not expect any losses as a result of
    counterparty defaults. We sell our products primarily to large
    organizations in different industries and geographies. Credit
    risk is mitigated by our credit evaluation process and limited
    payment terms. We do not require collateral or other security to
    support accounts receivable. In addition, we maintain an
    allowance for potential credit losses.

Net Income per Share

— Basic net income per
    share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average
    number of common shares outstanding for that period. Diluted net
    income per share is computed giving effect to all dilutive
    potential shares that were outstanding during the period.
    Dilutive potential common shares consist of incremental common
    shares subject to repurchase, common shares issuable upon
    exercise of stock options, and restricted stock awards.

    per share computation, as their exercise prices were greater
    than the average market price of the common shares for the
    periods presented and would therefore be antidilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

— On April 29,
    2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R,

“Share

-

Based Payment”

(“SFAS No. 123R”), which required us to
    measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based
    payments awards, including employee stock options, restricted
    stock units and rights to purchase shares under employee stock
    purchase plans, based on their estimated fair value and to
    recognize the costs in our financial statements over the
    employees’ requisite service period. Total stock-based
    compensation expense recognized in fiscal 2008 and 2007 was
    $147,964 and $163,033, respectively.

The fair value of employee restricted stock units is equal to
    the market value of our common stock on the date the award is
    granted. Calculating the fair value of employee stock options
    and the rights to purchase shares under the employee stock
    purchase plans requires estimates and significant judgment. We
    use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair
    value of these awards, consistent with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123R. The fair value of each option grant is
    estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model, and is not remeasured as a result of subsequent
    stock price fluctuations. Option-pricing models require the
    input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected
    term of options, the expected price volatility of the stock
    underlying such options and forfeiture rate. Our expected term
    assumption is based primarily on historical exercise and
    post-vesting forfeiture experience. Our stock price volatility
    assumption is based on an implied volatility of call options and
    dealer quotes on call options, generally having a term of
    greater than twelve months. Changes in the subjective
    assumptions required in the valuation models may significantly
    affect the estimated value of our stock-based awards, the
    related stock-based compensation expense and, consequently, our
    results of operations. Likewise, the shortening of the
    contractual life of our options could change the estimated
    exercise behavior in a manner other than currently expected.



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In addition, SFAS 123R requires that we estimate the number
    of stock-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee
    turnover. Our forfeiture assumption is based primarily on
    historical experience. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate
    can have a significant effect on reported stock-based
    compensation expense, as the effect of adjusting the rate for
    all expense amortization after April 28, 2006 is recognized
    in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If the actual
    forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate,
    then an adjustment will be made to increase the estimated
    forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense
    recognized in the financial statements. If the actual forfeiture
    rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an
    adjustment will be made to lower the estimated forfeiture rate,
    which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in
    our financial statements. The expense we recognize in future
    periods will be affected by changes in the estimated forfeiture
    rate and may differ significantly from amounts recognized in the
    current period

and/or

our
    forecasts.

Had compensation expense been determined based on the fair value
    at the grant date for awards, consistent with the provisions of

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

— In May
    2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued a new final Staff Position
    (“FSP”) No. APB

14-1

“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlements).”

Under the final FSP, cash settled
    convertible securities would be separated into their debt and
    equity components. The value assigned to the debt component
    would be the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of a
    similar debt instrument without the conversion feature, and the
    difference between the proceeds for the convertible debt and the
    amount reflected as a debt liability would be recorded as
    additional paid-in capital. As a result, the debt would be
    recorded at a discount reflecting its below-market coupon
    interest rate. The debt would subsequently be accreted to its
    par value over its expected life, with the rate of interest that
    reflects the market rate at issuance being reflected on the
    income statement. This change in methodology will affect the
    calculations of net income and earnings per share for many
    issuers of cash settled convertible securities. The final FSP
    requires explicit disclosure requirements and will be effective
    for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal
    years. This final FSP is to be applied retrospectively to all
    periods presented. This standard will have an effect on the
    Company’s convertible debenture sold in June 2008 as
    described in Note 17, Subsequent Events.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

“Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — An Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133”

(SFAS No. 161).
    SFAS No. 161 requires additional disclosures about the
    objectives of using derivative instruments, the method by which
    the derivative instruments and related hedged items are
    accounted for under FASB Statement No. 133 and its related
    interpretations, and the effect of derivative instruments and
    related hedged items on financial position, financial
    performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 also requires
    disclosure of the fair value of derivative instruments and their
    gains and losses in a tabular format. This statement is
    effective for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. We are
    currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 161 will have on our consolidated financial
    statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),

“Business Combinations”

(SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R)
    establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in
    a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial
    statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
    assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the
    acquisition date fair value. SFAS No. 141(R)
    determines what information



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to
    evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business
    combination. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 141(R)
    at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2010, which
    begins on April 25, 2009. We are currently evaluating the
    effect that the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have
    on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51.”

(SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 will change
    the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will
    be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as
    a component of equity. This new consolidation method will
    significantly change the accounting for transactions with
    minority interest holders. We are required to adopt
    SFAS No. 160 at the beginning of the first quarter of
    fiscal 2010, which begins on April 25, 2009. We are
    currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 160 will have on our consolidated financial
    statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Financial Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 115 “Accounting for Certain Investments
    in Debt and Equity Securities.”

SFAS No. 159
    allows measurement at fair value of eligible financial assets
    and liabilities that are not otherwise measured at fair value.
    If the fair value option for an eligible item is elected,
    unrealized gains and losses for that item shall be reported in
    current earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
    SFAS No. 159 also establishes presentation and
    disclosure requirements designed to draw comparison between the
    different measurement attributes the company elects for similar
    types of assets and liabilities. We are required to adopt
    SFAS No. 159 at the beginning of the first quarter of
    fiscal 2009, which began on April 26, 2008. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 159 is not expected to have a material impact
    on our financial position or results of operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157

“Fair Value Measurements.”

SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted
    accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. SFAS No. 157 affects other accounting
    pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements
    where the FASB has previously concluded that fair value is the
    relevant measurement attribute. SFAS No. 157 does not
    require any new fair value measurements, but may change current
    practice in some instances. SFAS No. 157 is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We will
    adopt SFAS No. 157 in the first quarter of fiscal year
    2009. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

No. 157-2

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”

(“FSP 157-2”).

FSP 157-2

permits a one-year deferral in applying the measurement
    provisions of SFAS 157 to non-financial assets and
    non-financial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed
    at fair value in an entity’s financial statements on a
    recurring basis (at least annually). The adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 and

FSP 157-2

is not expected to have a material impact on our financial
    position or results of operations.

NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The unrealized losses on our investments in corporate bonds and
    U.S. government agencies were caused by interest rate
    increases. We believe that we will be able to collect all
    principal and interest amounts due to us at maturity given the
    high credit quality of these investments. Because the decline in
    market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and
    not credit quality, and because we have the ability and intent
    to hold those investments until a recovery of fair value, which
    may be maturity, we do not consider these investments to be
    other-than temporarily impaired at April 25, 2008.

Since the third quarter of calendar 2007, the credit markets
    have been volatile and have experienced a shortage in overall
    liquidity due to the instability in the sub-prime lending
    industry. We believe we have sufficient liquidity under cash
    provided by operations and our financing agreements. If the
    global credit market continues to deteriorate, our investment
    portfolio may be impacted and we may determine that we may have
    experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value of
    some of our investments, which could adversely impact our
    financial results. See further discussion under
    Item 1A — Risk Factors, “Funds associated
    with certain of our auction rate securities may not be
    accessible for in excess of 12 months and our auction rate
    securities may experience an other-than-temporary decline in
    value, which could adversely affect our earnings.”

Our long term investments include auction rate securities (ARS)
    with a fair value of $72,702 at April 25, 2008. These ARS
    are securities with long term nominal maturities which, in
    accordance with investment policy guidelines, had credit ratings
    of AAA and Aaa at the time of purchase. Interest rates for ARS
    are reset through a “Dutch auction” each month, which
    historically has provided a liquid market for these securities.

All of our ARS are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed
    by the U.S. Department of Education, and we believe the
    credit quality of these securities is high based on this
    guarantee. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008,
    liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the
    failure of auctions for certain ARS investments, with a par
    value of $76,202 at April 25, 2008. For each failed
    auction, the interest rate moves to a maximum rate defined for
    each security, and the ARS continue to pay interest in
    accordance with their terms. However, the principal associated
    with the ARS will not be accessible until there is a successful
    auction or such time as other markets for ARS investments
    develop.

We believe that the underlying credit quality of the assets
    backing our ARS investments have not been impacted by the
    reduced liquidity of these investments. Based on an analysis of
    the fair value and marketability of these investments, we
    recorded a temporary impairment within other comprehensive
    income, an element of stockholders’ equity on our balance
    sheet, of approximately $3,500 at April 25, 2008. In
    addition, we have classified all of our auction rate securities,
    with an estimated fair value of $72,702, as long-term assets in
    our consolidated balance sheet as of April 25, 2008 as our
    ability to liquidate such securities in the next 12 months
    is uncertain. We will continue to monitor these securities; if
    we determine that the decline in market value is
    other-than-temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized at
    that time. We do not believe that the lack of liquidity relating
    to our ARS investments will impact our ability to fund working
    capital needs, capital expenditures or other operating
    requirements.

We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business.
    We lease sales offices, research and development facilities, and
    other property and equipment under operating leases throughout
    the United States and internationally, which expire on various
    dates through fiscal year 2017. Substantially all lease
    agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time
    and contain payment escalation clauses. Some lease agreements
    provide us with the option to renew or terminate the lease. Our
    future operating lease obligations would change if we were to
    exercise these options and if we were to enter into additional
    operating lease agreements. Facilities operating lease payments
    exclude the leases impacted by the restructurings described in
    Note 13. Total rent expense for all facilities was $29,586
    for year ended April 25, 2008, and $23,986 and $18,787 for
    years ended April 27, 2007 and April 28, 2006,
    respectively.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of April 25, 2008, we have commitments relating to two
    financing, construction, and leasing arrangements with BNP for
    office space and a parking structure to be located on land in
    Sunnyvale, California that we currently own. These arrangements
    require us to lease our land to BNP for a period of
    99 years to construct approximately 380,000 square
    feet of office space costing up to $113,500. After completion of
    construction, we will pay minimum lease payments, which vary
    based on the LIBOR plus a spread or a fixed rate (3.49% and
    3.06% for the first and second lease, respectively, at
    April 25, 2008) on the cost of the facilities. We
    began to make lease payments on the first building in January
    2008 and expect to begin making lease payments on the second
    building in December 2008, respectively, for terms of five
    years. We have the option to renew the leases for two
    consecutive five-year periods upon approval by BNP. Upon
    expiration (or upon any earlier termination) of the lease terms,
    we must elect one of the following options: (i) purchase
    the buildings from BNP for $48,500 and $65,000, respectively;
    (ii) if certain conditions are met, arrange for the sale of
    the buildings by BNP to a third party for an amount equal to at
    least $41,225 and $55,250, respectively, and be liable for any
    deficiency between the net proceeds received from the third
    party and such amounts; or (iii) pay BNP supplemental
    payments of $41,225 and $55,250, respectively, in which event we
    may recoup some or all of such payments by arranging for a sale
    of either or both buildings by BNP during the ensuing two-year
    period.

As of April 25, 2008, we have a commitment relating to a
    third financing, construction, and leasing arrangement with BNP
    for facility space to be located on land currently owned by us
    in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. This arrangement
    requires us to lease our land to BNP for a period of
    99 years to construct approximately 120,000 square
    feet for a data center costing up to $61,000. After completion
    of construction, we will pay minimum lease payments, which vary
    based on the LIBOR plus a spread (3.06% at April 25,
    2008) on the cost of the facility. We expect to begin
    making lease payments on the completed building in January 2009
    for a term of five and a half years. We have the option to renew
    the lease for two consecutive five-year periods upon approval by
    BNP. Upon expiration (or upon any earlier termination) of the
    lease term, we must elect one of the following options:
    (i) purchase the building from BNP for $61,000;
    (ii) if certain conditions are met, arrange for the sale of
    the building by BNP to a third party for an amount equal to at
    least $51,850, and be liable for any deficiency between the

net proceeds received from the third party and $51,850; or
    (iii) pay BNP a supplemental payment of $51,850, in which
    event we may recoup some or all of such payment by arranging for
    the sale of the building by BNP during the ensuing two-year
    period.

As of April 25, 2008, we have a commitment relating to a
    fourth financing and operating leasing arrangement with BNP for
    approximately 374,274 square feet of buildings located in
    Sunnyvale, California costing up to $101,050. This arrangement
    requires us to pay minimum lease payments, which may vary based
    on the LIBOR plus a spread or a fixed rate (3.47% and 3.49% for
    the first two buildings, and 3.06% for the third building at
    April 25, 2008). We began to make lease payments on two
    buildings in December 2007 and the third building in January
    2008 for terms of five years. We have the option to renew the
    leases for two consecutive five-year periods upon approval by
    BNP. Upon expiration (or upon any earlier termination) of the
    lease terms, we must elect one of the following options:
    (i) purchase the buildings from BNP for $101,050;
    (ii) if certain conditions are met, arrange for the sale of
    the buildings by BNP to a third party for an amount equal to at
    least $85,893, and be liable for any deficiency between the net
    proceeds received from the third party and $85,893; or
    (iii) pay BNP a supplemental payment of $85,893, in which
    event we may recoup some or all of such payment by arranging for
    the sale of the buildings by BNP during the ensuing two-year
    period.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we entered into a
    fifth financing, construction, and leasing arrangement with BNP
    for facility space to be located on land currently owned by us
    in Sunnyvale, California. This arrangement requires us to lease
    our land to BNP for a period of 99 years to construct
    approximately 189,697 square feet for a data center costing
    up to $48,950. After completion of construction, we will pay
    minimum lease payments, which vary based on the LIBOR plus a
    spread (3.06% at April 25, 2008) on the cost of the
    facility. We expect to begin making lease payments on the
    completed building in January 2010 for a term of five years. We
    have the option to renew the lease for two consecutive five-year
    periods upon approval by BNP. Upon expiration (or upon any
    earlier termination) of the lease term, we must elect one of the
    following options: (i) purchase the building from BNP for
    $48,950; (ii) if certain conditions are met, arrange for
    the sale of the building by BNP to a third party for an amount
    equal to at least $41,608, and be liable for any deficiency
    between the net proceeds received from the third party and
    $41,608; or (iii) pay BNP a supplemental payment of
    $41,608, in which event we may recoup some or all of such
    payment by arranging for the sale of the building by BNP during
    the ensuing two-year period.

All leases require us to maintain specified financial covenants
    with which we were in compliance as of April 25, 2008. Such
    specified financial covenants include a maximum ratio of Total
    Debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and
    Amortization (“EBITDA”) and a minimum amount of
    Unencumbered Cash and Short Term Investments.

As of April 25, 2008, the notional fair value of our
    foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts
    totaled $419,264. We do not believe that these derivatives
    present significant credit risks, because the counterparties to
    the derivatives consist of major financial institutions, and we
    manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any
    one counterparty. We do not enter into derivative financial
    instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Other than the
    risk associated with the financial condition of the
    counterparties, our maximum exposure related to foreign currency
    forward and option contracts is limited to the premiums paid on
    purchased options.

We have both recourse and nonrecourse lease financing
    arrangements with third party leasing companies through
    preexisting relationships with customers. Under the terms of
    recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we
    remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments
    to the third party leasing company in the event that any
    customers default. For these recourse arrangements, revenues on
    the sale of our product to the leasing company are deferred and
    recognized into income as payments to the leasing company come
    due. As of April 25, 2008, and April 27, 2007, the
    maximum recourse exposure under such leases totaled
    approximately $24,842 and $10,262, respectively. Under the terms
    of the nonrecourse leases, we do not have any continuing
    obligations or liabilities. To date, we have not experienced
    material losses under this lease financing program.

From time to time, we have committed to purchase various key
    components used in the manufacture of our products. We establish
    accruals for estimated losses on purchased components for which
    we believe it is probable that they will not be utilized in
    future operations. To the extent that such forecasts are not
    achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may change.

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which may
    arise in the normal course of business. While the outcome of
    these legal matters is currently not determinable, we do not
    believe that any current litigation or claims will have a
    material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, operating
    results, or financial condition.

We are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the
    United States and several foreign tax jurisdictions. The rights
    to some of our intellectual property (“IP”) are owned
    by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made
    between foreign and U.S. tax jurisdictions relating to the
    use of this IP in a qualified cost sharing arrangement.
    Recently, several other U.S. companies have had their
    foreign IP arrangements challenged as part of IRS examinations,
    which have resulted in material proposed assessments

and/or

pending litigation. Effective September 27, 2007, the
    Internal Revenue Service’s Large and Mid-Sized Business
    Division released a Coordinated Issues Paper (“CIP”)
    with respect to qualified cost sharing arrangements
    (“CSAs”). Specifically, this CIP provides guidance to
    IRS personnel concerning methods that may be applied to evaluate
    the arm’s length charge for internally developed as well as
    acquisition-related intangible property that is made available
    to a qualified CSA. We have evaluated the IRS’s positions
    in this CIP and believe that it will not have a material adverse
    impact upon our consolidated financial position and the results
    of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, we do not believe,
    based upon information currently known to us, that the final
    resolution of any of our audits will have a material adverse
    effect upon our consolidated financial position and the results
    of operations and cash flows. However, if upon the conclusion of
    these audits the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any
    of these tax jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax
    provision we have recorded or reserved for, our overall
    effective tax rate may be adversely impacted in the period of
    adjustment.

Effective March 20, 2008, the IRS also released a CIP with
    respect to the cost sharing of stock based compensation.
    Specifically, this CIP provides guidance to IRS personnel
    concerning stock based compensation related to a CSA by
    providing that the parties to a CSA will share all costs related
    to intangible development of the covered intangibles, including
    but not limited to, salaries, bonuses, and other payroll costs
    and benefits, and that taxpayers should include all forms of
    compensation in the cost pool, including those costs related to
    stock-based compensation. We have evaluated the IRS’s
    positions in this CIP and have concluded that it will not have a
    material adverse impact upon our consolidated financial position
    and the results of operations and cash flows.

We received a subpoena from the Office of Inspector General for
    the General Services Administration (“GSA”) seeking
    various records relating to GSA contracting activity by us
    during the period beginning in 1995 and ending in 2005. The
    subpoena is part of an investigation being conducted by the GSA
    and the Department of Justice regarding potential violations of
    the False Claims Act in connection with our GSA contracting
    activity. The subpoena requested a range of documents including
    documents relating to our discount practices and compliance with
    the price reduction clause provisions of its GSA contracts. We
    are cooperating with the investigation and have produced
    documents and met with the Department of Justice on several
    occasions. Violations of the False Claims Act could result in
    the imposition of a damage remedy which includes treble damages
    plus civil penalties, and could also result in us being
    suspended or debarred from future government contracting, any or
    a combination of which could have a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations or financial condition. However, as
    the investigation is still ongoing and we are unable at this
    time to determine the likely outcome of this matter, no
    provision has been recorded as of April 25, 2008.

On September 5, 2007, we filed a patent infringement
    lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory
    damages and a permanent injunction against Sun Microsystems. On
    October 25, 2007, Sun Microsystems filed a counter claim
    against us in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory
    damages and a permanent injunction. On October 29, 2007,
    Sun filed a second lawsuit against us in the Northern District
    of California asserting additional patents against us. The Texas
    court granted a joint motion to transfer the Texas

    third lawsuit in federal court that extends the patent
    infringement charges to storage management technology we
    acquired in January 2008. We are unable at this time to
    determine the likely outcome of these various patent
    litigations. In addition, as we are unable to reasonably
    estimate the amount or range of any potential settlement, no
    accrual has been recorded as of April 25, 2008.

Line of
    Credit

In July 1998, we negotiated a $5,000 unsecured revolving credit
    facility with a domestic commercial bank. The credit facility
    expired in December 2007, except to the extent of our
    outstanding letters of credit amounting to $1,755 as of
    April 25, 2008. Under terms of the credit facility, we must
    maintain various financial covenants, with which we are in
    compliance. Any borrowings under this agreement bear interest at
    either LIBOR plus 1% or at the lender’s “prime”
    lending rate, such rate determined at our discretion. In
    addition, the amounts allocated under our unsecured revolving
    credit facility to support certain of our outstanding letters of
    credit amounted to $450 (see Note 6) as of
    April 25, 2008.

We also have foreign exchange facilities used for hedging
    arrangements with several banks that allow us to enter into
    foreign exchange contracts of up to $600,000, of which $284,619
    was available at April 25, 2008.

Credit
    Facility and Debt

On November 2, 2007, we entered into a senior unsecured
    credit agreement (the “Unsecured Credit Agreement”)
    with certain lenders and BNP Paribas (“BNP”), as
    syndication agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank National Association
    (“JPMorgan”), as administrative agent. The Unsecured
    Credit Agreement provides for a revolving unsecured credit
    facility that is comprised of commitments from various lenders
    who agree to make revolving loans and swingline loans and issue
    letters of credit of up to an aggregate amount of $250,000 with
    a term of five years. Revolving loans may be, at our option,
    Alternative Base Rate borrowings or Eurodollar borrowings.
    Interest on Eurodollar borrowings accrues at a floating rate
    based on LIBOR for the interest period specified by us plus a
    spread based on our leverage ratio. Interest on Alternative Base
    Rate borrowings, swingline loans and letter of credit
    disbursements accrues at a rate based on the Prime Rate in
    effect on such day. The proceeds of the loans may be used for
    our general corporate purposes, including stock repurchases and
    working capital needs. As of April 25, 2008, no amount was
    outstanding under this facility.

On October 5, 2007, the Company entered into a Secured
    Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Securities. The Secured Credit
    Agreement provides for a revolving secured credit facility of up
    to $250,000 with a term of five years. On October 10, 2007,
    $250,000 was advanced to the Company and was recorded in the
    Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets
    as of April 25, 2008. During fiscal 2008, we made
    repayments of $146,400 and drew $69,000 on the revolving credit
    facility. As of April 25, 2008, the outstanding balance on
    the Secured Credit Agreement was $172,600. The full amount is
    due on the maturity date of October 5, 2012. As of
    April 25, 2008, we have pledged $242,613 of long-term
    restricted investments in connection with the Secured Credit
    Agreement. Interest for the Secured Credit Agreement accrues at
    a floating rate based on the base rate in effect from time to
    time, plus a margin, which totaled 2.88% at April 25, 2008.

On March 31, 2006, NetApp Global LTD., a subsidiary of the
    Company, entered into a loan agreement (the “Loan
    Agreement”) with JPMorgan, as administrative agent. The
    Loan Agreement provides for a term loan available in two
    tranches, a tranche of $220,000 (“Tranche A”) and
    a tranche of $80,000 (“Tranche B”), for an
    aggregate borrowing of $300,000. The proceeds of the term loan
    were used to finance a dividend from Global to the Company under
    the American Jobs Creation Act. The Tranche A term loan,
    together with accrued and unpaid interest, was due in full on
    the maturity date of March 31, 2008. During fiscal 2008, we
    made repayments of $85,110 on the term loan. The Tranche A
    and Tranche B term loan were fully repaid as of
    April 25, 2008, and January 26, 2007, respectively.

    Equity

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Effective April 29, 2006, we adopted
    SFAS No. 123R,

“Share-Based Payments,”

which provides guidance on accounting for stock-based awards
    for employee services. We elected to adopt the modified
    prospective method, and accordingly we were not required to
    restate our prior period financial statements.

Prior
    to the Adoption of SFAS No. 123R

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, stock-based
    compensation expense had not been recognized in our consolidated
    statement of operations, other than those related to
    acquisitions and restricted stock awards. As a result of
    adopting SFAS No. 123R, pretax stock-based
    compensation expense recorded for fiscal 2008 and 2007 of
    $147,964 and $163,033, respectively, was related to employee
    stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”),
    restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), and employee stock
    purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Pretax
    stock-based compensation expense of $13,293 for fiscal 2006,
    which we recorded under APB No. 25, was related to RSUs,
    RSAs, and options assumed from acquisitions.

As required by SFAS No. 123R, we eliminated the
    unamortized deferred stock compensation of $49,266 on
    April 29, 2006. Our common stock and additional paid-in
    capital were also reduced by the same amount and had been
    included in the Stockholders’ Equity of our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets as of April 28, 2006.

SFAS No. 123R
    Stock-Based Compensation Expense

The stock-based compensation expenses included in the

In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we
    changed our accounting policy of attributing the fair value of
    stock-based compensation to expense from the accelerated
    multiple-option approach provided by APB No. 25, as allowed
    under SFAS No. 123, to the straight-line single-option
    approach. Compensation expense for all stock-based payment
    awards expected to vest that were granted on or prior to
    April 28, 2006 will continue to be recognized using the
    accelerated multiple-option method. Compensation expense for all
    stock-based payment awards expected to vest that were granted
    subsequent to April 28, 2006 is recognized on a
    straight-line basis under the single-option approach.

Valuation
    Assumptions

In compliance with SFAS No. 123R, we estimated the
    fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes model on the
    date of the grant. Assumptions used in the Black-Scholes
    valuation model were as follows:

Equity
    Incentive Programs

Stock Option Plans

— In September 1995, we
    adopted the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan (“the 1995
    Plan”). All outstanding options issued under a previous
    option plan were incorporated into the 1995 Plan upon the
    effectiveness of our initial public offering.

Under the 1995 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant to
    employees, directors, and consultants options to purchase shares
    of our common stock. The 1995 Plan comprises three separate
    equity incentive programs: (i) the Discretionary Option
    Program under which options may be granted to eligible
    individuals at a fixed price per share; (ii) the Salary
    Investment Option Grant Program under which the company’s
    officers and other highly compensated employees may elect to
    have a portion of their base salary reduced in return for stock
    options, and (iii) the Stock Issuance Program under which
    eligible persons may be issued shares of Common Stock directly.
    Options granted under the 1995 Plan generally vest at a rate of
    25% on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date
    and then ratably over the following 36 months. Options
    expire as determined by the Board of Directors, but not more
    than 10 years after the date of grant. The 1999 Plan
    supplements the existing 1995 Plan which will expire on
    August 31, 2008 and all available share may or may not be
    issued prior to expiration. However, an Automatic Option Grant
    Program previously in effect under the 1995 Plan terminated as
    of October 26, 1999, and all automatic option grants made
    to nonemployee board members on or after that date will be made
    under the 1999 Plan.

In April 1997, the Board of Directors adopted the Special
    Nonofficer Stock Option Plan (“the Nonofficer Plan”)
    which provides for the grant of options and the issuance of
    common stock under terms substantially the same as those
    provided under the 1995 Plan, except that the Nonofficer Plan
    allows only for the issuance of nonqualified options to
    nonofficer employees. The Nonofficer Plan expired on
    December 31, 2007, and no further grants may be made from
    the plan.

In August 1999, the Board of Directors adopted the 1999 Stock
    Option Plan (“the 1999 Plan”), which comprises five
    separate equity incentive programs: (i) the Discretionary
    Option Grant Program under which options may be granted to
    eligible individuals during the service period at a fixed price
    per share; (ii) the Stock Appreciation Rights Program under
    which eligible persons may be granted stock appreciation rights
    that allow individuals to receive the appreciation in Fair
    Market Value of the shares; (iii) the Stock Issuance
    Program under which eligible individuals may be issued shares of
    Common Stock directly; (iv) the Performance Share and
    Performance Unit Program under which eligible persons may be
    granted performance shares and performance units which result in
    payment to the participant only if performance goals or other
    vesting criteria are achieved; and (v) the Automatic Option
    Grant Program under which nonemployee board members
    automatically receive option grants at designated intervals over
    their period of board service.

Under the 1999 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant to
    employees, directors, and consultants and other independent
    advisors options to purchase shares of our common stock during
    their period of service with us. The exercise price for an
    incentive stock option and a nonstatutory option cannot be less
    than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the
    grant date. Options granted under the 1999 Plan generally vest
    over a four-year period. Options granted prior to April 29,
    2006, have a term of no more than 10 years after the date
    of grant and those granted after April 29, 2006 have a term
    of no more than seven years, subject to earlier termination upon
    the occurrence of certain events. In fiscal 2004, the 1999 Plan
    was amended to create the Stock Issuance Program, whereby
    eligible individuals may be issued shares of common stock
    directly, either through the issuance or immediate purchase of
    these shares or as a bonus for services rendered. In fiscal
    2005, the 1999 Plan was amended to increase the share reserve by
    an additional 10,200 shares of common stock; to create the
    Stock Appreciation Right Program under which eligible persons
    may be granted stock appreciation rights that allow individuals
    to receive the appreciation in Fair Market Value of the shares;
    to create the Performance Share and Performance Unit Program
    under which eligible persons may be granted performance shares
    and performance units that result in payment to the participant
    only if performance goals or other vesting criteria are
    achieved; and to prohibit the repricing of any outstanding stock
    option or stock appreciation right after it has been granted or
    to cancel any outstanding stock option or stock appreciation
    right and immediately replace it with a new stock option or
    stock

appreciation right with a lower exercise price unless approved
    by stockholders. In fiscal 2006, the 1999 Plan was amended to
    increase the share reserve by an additional 10,600 shares
    of common stock and limit the number of shares that may be
    issued pursuant to full value awards that may be granted under
    the Stock Issuance Program or the Performance Share and
    Performance Unit Program. In fiscal 2007, the 1999 Plan was
    amended to increase the share reserve by an additional
    10,900 shares of common stock and to increase Director
    compensation under the Automatic Option Grant Program from an
    option to purchase 15,000 shares to an option to purchase
    20,000 shares. In fiscal 2008, the 1999 Plan was amended to
    increase the share reserve by an additional 7,200 shares of
    common stock; to extend the term of the Plan for a period of ten
    years; to increase the limitation of the percentage of Stock
    Issuance and Performance Shares or Performance Units that may be
    granted under the Plan from 10% to 30% of the shares reserved;
    to increase the limit on the value of performance units a
    participant may receive during any calendar year to $2,000; and
    to decrease the maximum term of options and stock appreciation
    rights to seven years. There have been no repricing to date
    under any of the plans, and no stock appreciation rights have
    been issued.

In fiscal 2008, we assumed a stock option plan in connection
    with our acquisition of Onaro (see Note 12). Under the
    terms of the merger agreement, options and restricted stock
    units to purchase 1,000 shares were exchanged at certain
    exchange ratios. The options granted under this plan generally
    vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting
    commencement date and then ratably over the following
    36 months. The restricted stock units generally vest at a
    rate of 50% on the first and second annual anniversaries of the
    vesting commencement date.

In fiscal 2007, we assumed two stock option plans in connection
    with our acquisition of Topio (see Note 12.) Under the
    terms of the merger agreement, options and restricted stock
    units to purchase 858 shares were exchanged at certain
    exchange ratios. The options granted under these plans generally
    vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting
    commencement date and then ratably over the following
    36 months. The restricted stock units generally vest at a
    rate of 50% on the first and second annual anniversaries of the
    vesting commencement date.

In fiscal 2006, we assumed various stock option plans in
    connection with our Alacritus and Decru acquisitions. Pursuant
    to the provisions of the merger agreements, outstanding shares
    were exchanged under certain exchange ratios in effect at the
    time of each merger. Options granted under these plans generally
    vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting
    commencement date and then ratably over the following
    36 months. Options expire not more than 10 years after
    the date of grant.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The intrinsic value of stock options represents the difference
    between the exercise price of stock options and the market price
    of our stock on that day for all in-the-money options. The
    weighted-average fair value for the fiscal 2008 and 2007 grants
    as of the grant date was $25.43 and $12.83, respectively. The
    total intrinsic value of options exercised was $83,129, $267,165
    and $302,954 for fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. We
    received $66,614, $178,241, and $203,977 from the exercise of
    stock options for fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.
    There was $312,965 of total unrecognized compensation as of
    April 25, 2008 related to options and restricted stock
    units. The unrecognized compensation will be amortized on a
    straight-line basis over a weighted-average remaining period of
    2.6 years.

Stock Issuance Program

— Under the 1995 Stock
    Issuance Program, certain eligible persons may be issued shares
    of common stock directly. No restricted stock award was issued
    to employees during fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2007, and 2006,
    125 and 210 shares, respectively, of restricted stock
    awards were issued to certain employees. Prior to the adoption
    of SFAS No. 123R, the exercise price discount from
    fair market value of these shares has been recorded as deferred
    stock compensation expense in fiscal 2006, which is being
    amortized ratably over its respective vesting periods, between
    three to four years. After the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R in fiscal 2008 and 2007, the fair value
    of these grants are recorded as part of the stock-based
    compensation. At April 25, 2008, 3,635 shares were
    available for future issuances under this program.

The following table summarizes our nonvested shares (restricted
    stock awards) as of April 25, 2008:

Although nonvested shares are legally issued, they are

    by the Company when employees terminate their employment. The
    total fair value of shares vested during fiscal 2008 and 2007
    was $1,632 and $3,135, respectively. There was $4,781 of total
    unrecognized compensation as of April 25, 2008 related to
    restricted stock awards. The unrecognized compensation will be
    amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average
    remaining period of 2.2 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

— Under the
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), employees are
    entitled to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the
    fair market value at certain specified dates over a two-year
    period. In fiscal 2008, the plan was amended to increase the
    share reserve by an additional 1,600 shares. In fiscal 2007
    and 2006, the plan was amended to increase the share reserve by
    an additional 1,600 and 1,500 shares of common stock,
    respectively. Of the 20,600 shares authorized to be issued
    under this plan, 3,809 shares were available for issuance
    at April 25, 2008; 2,057, 1,632, and 1,575 shares were
    issued in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, at a
    weighted average price of $23.38, $22.78, and $18.28
    respectively.

    compensation cost for shares purchased under the ESPP plan was
    $16,513 and $13,099 for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    There was $1,798 of total unrecognized compensation as of
    April 25, 2008 related to ESPP. The unrecognized
    compensation will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a
    weighted-average remaining period of 0.1 years.

Stockholders’

Preferred Stock

— Our Board of Directors has
    the authority to issue up to 5,000 shares of preferred
    stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences,
    privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, of those
    shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders.

Deferred Stock Compensation

— Prior to adoption
    of SFAS No. 123R in fiscal 2007, deferred stock
    compensation was recorded for the grant of stock awards or
    shares of restricted stock to employees at exercise prices
    deemed to be less than the fair value of our common stock on the
    grant date. Deferred stock compensation was also recorded for
    retention escrow shares withheld in accordance with the merger
    agreement. Deferred stock compensation was adjusted to reflect
    cancellations and forfeitures due to employee terminations as
    they occur. We recorded $29,855 of deferred stock compensation
    in fiscal 2006, primarily related to unvested options assumed
    and retention escrow shares withheld in the Spinnaker
    acquisition, restricted stock awards to certain employees, and
    the grant of stock options below fair value to certain highly
    compensated employees. We reversed $2,886 of deferred
    compensation in fiscal 2006 due to employee terminations. The
    reversals were primarily related to the forfeiture of unvested
    options assumed in acquisitions as a result of employee
    terminations.

We recorded $60 in compensation expense in fiscal 2006 for the
    fair value of options granted to a member of the Board of
    Directors in recognition for services performed outside of the
    normal capacity of a board member. During fiscal 2002, 100
    common shares under the 1995 Plan were granted at an exercise
    price of $15.32 per share, the fair market value per share on
    the grant date. The option has a term of 10 years measured
    from the grant date, subject to earlier termination following
    his cessation of board service, and will vest in a series of 48
    successive equal monthly installments upon his completion of
    each month of board service over the

48-month

period measured from the grant date.

We recorded $13,233 in compensation expense for fiscal 2006
    primarily related to the amortization of deferred stock
    compensation from unvested options assumed in the Decru,
    Alacritus, WebManage and Spinnaker acquisitions; the retention
    escrow shares relative to Spinnaker, the grant of stock options
    to certain highly compensated employees below fair value at the
    date of grant and the award of restricted stock to certain
    employees.

As required by SFAS No. 123R, we eliminated the
    unamortized deferred stock compensation of $49,266 on
    April 29, 2006 and reduced our common stock and additional
    paid-in capital by the same amount .

Stock Repurchase Program

— Since the inception
    of the stock repurchase program through April 25, 2008, we
    have purchased a total of 87,365 shares of our common stock
    at an average price of $28.93 per share for an aggregate
    purchase price of $2,527,395. At April 25, 2008, $496,244
    remained available for repurchases under the plan. The stock
    repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

During fiscal 2008, we repurchased 32,772 shares of our
    common stock at an aggregate cost of $903,704, or a weighted
    average price of $27.58 per share. During fiscal 2007, we
    repurchased 22,597 shares of our common stock at an
    aggregate cost of $805,708, or a weighted average price of
    $35.66 per share. The repurchases were recorded as treasury
    stock and resulted in a reduction of stockholders’ equity.

    respectively, and are included in Long Term Deferred Taxes and
    Other Assets within the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As discussed in Note 2, effective April 28, 2007, we
    adopted FIN No. 48,

“Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109,”

, which clarifies the
    accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
    enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income
    Taxes”

. This interpretation prescribes a recognition
    threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
    recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
    to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides
    guidance on derecognition of tax benefits, classification on the
    balance sheet, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure, and transition.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits upon the adoption
    of FIN No. 48, on April 28, 2007, was $58,326.
    There was no cumulative effect from the adoption of
    FIN No. 48; however, certain amounts were reclassified

    for income taxes.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. During
    the fiscal years ended 2005 through 2007, we recognized total
    accrued interest and penalties of approximately $170 and have
    included this accrual in our FIN No. 48 disclosure
    balances.

We are subject to taxation in the United States, various states,
    and several foreign jurisdictions. Our federal income tax
    returns are currently being examined for the fiscal years

2003-2004.

We are effectively subject to federal tax examination
    adjustments for tax years ended on or after fiscal year 2000, in
    that we have net operating loss carryforwards from these years
    that could be subject to adjustment, if and when utilized.

As we are in the early stages of the federal income tax return
    and foreign jurisdiction income tax audit process, at this time
    we can not make a determination as to whether or not recognition
    of any unrecognized tax benefits will occur within the next
    12 months.

The tax years that remain subject to examination for our major
    tax jurisdictions are shown below:

The above table excludes the net operating loss carryover risk
    identified above with respect to federal and state tax returns.

We adopted SFAS No. 123R effective the beginning our
    fiscal 2007. Pursuant to the requirements of Footnote 82 of
    SFAS No. 123R, we no longer include unrealized stock
    option attributes as components of our gross deferred tax assets
    and corresponding valuation allowance disclosures. Footnote 82
    is applied on a prospective basis. The tax effected amounts of
    gross unrealized net operating loss and business tax credit
    carryforwards, and their corresponding valuation allowance
    excluded under Footnote 82 for the years ended April 25,
    2008 and April 27, 2007 are $245,130 and $363,303, which
    will result in additional paid in capital if and when realized
    as a reduction in taxes otherwise paid.

The Jobs Act created a one-time incentive for
    U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned
    abroad by providing an 85% dividend-received deduction for
    certain dividends from certain

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

During the fourth quarter of 2006, we incurred a charge of
    approximately $22,482 for federal and state income taxes



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

related to the repatriation of approximately $400,000 of
    accumulated income earned by its foreign subsidiaries. As a
    result of this dividend, there were no significant unremitted
    earnings held by our foreign subsidiaries at April 28,
    2006. As of our fiscal years ended April 25, 2008 and
    April 27, 2007, the amount of accumulated unremitted
    earnings from our foreign subsidiaries under APB No. 23 are
    approximately $677,200 and $330,000.

During fiscal 2006, our Netherlands subsidiary received a
    favorable tax ruling from the Netherlands tax authorities
    effective May 1, 2005. This ruling replaced a previous
    Netherlands tax ruling that was scheduled to expire on
    December 31, 2005. This ruling results in both a lower
    level of earnings subject to tax in the Netherlands and an
    extension of the expiration date to April 30, 2010.

Network Appliance Systems India Pvt. Ltd. received a tax holiday
    from the Indian tax authorities attributed to its call center
    and research and development activities effective June 6,
    2003. These activities qualify under the Software Technology
    Park of India (“STPI”) scheme for the development and
    manufacture of computer software and information technology
    enabled services. Under this tax holiday, net income derived
    from call center and research and development activities is
    exempt from Indian taxation. This tax holiday will expire on
    December 31, 2009.

As of April 25, 2008, our Netherlands subsidiary had a
    conditional royalty expense carryforward of $62,624 that may
    become available for offset against future Netherlands income.
    The carryforward may not, however, be used to offset income
    under the new Netherlands tax ruling expiring April 30,
    2010. The carryforward does not have an expiration date. We have
    established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset
    for the carryforward based upon our belief that we will not be
    able to utilize this attribute. In the event we are able to
    utilize this attribute, the tax benefit of the carryforward will
    be accounted for as a credit to stockholders’ equity of
    $9,219 and as a reduction to the income tax provision of $6,750.

We have been notified of examinations in the U.S. and
    several foreign tax jurisdictions. The rights to some of our
    intellectual property (“IP”) is owned by certain of
    our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made between
    U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of
    this IP. Recently, some other companies have had their foreign
    IP arrangements challenged as part of an examination. Our
    management does not believe, based upon information currently
    known to us that the final resolution of any of our audits will
    have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial
    position and the results of operations and cash flows. See
    Note 4 Commitments and Contingencies.

As of April 25, 2008, the federal and state net operating
    loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately
    $499,930 and $163,302, respectively. The federal net operating
    loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2021. State
    net operating losses of $8,582 will expire in fiscal years 2009
    through 2011, $5,422 will expire in fiscal year 2012 while the
    remaining $149,298 will expire in fiscal years 2013 through 2028.

As of April 25, 2008, we had federal and state tax credit
    carryforwards of approximately $73,466 and $61,356,
    respectively, available to offset future income tax liabilities.
    Federal tax credit carryforwards of $46,245 will begin to expire
    in fiscal years 2009 through 2020, while the remaining $27,221
    will expire in fiscal years beginning 2021. State tax credits of
    $1,513 will expire in fiscal years 2009 through 2012, while the
    remaining $59,843 is available indefinitely to reduce cash taxes
    otherwise payable. As discussed above, most of the net operating
    loss and tax credit carryovers, if realized, will be recognized
    as additional paid in capital in that they are employee stock
    option tax attributes.

During fiscal 2005, we established a valuation allowance against
    certain capital loss carryforwards of approximately $3,468 based
    upon our belief at that time that we would not be able to
    utilize this attribute before expiration starting in fiscal
    2008. However, during fiscal 2007, the sale of NetCache
    generated capital gain income against which the entire capital
    loss carryforward was utilized. As a result, we realized a tax
    benefit for the entire capital loss carryforward through the
    reversal of the valuation allowance originally established
    during fiscal 2005.

During fiscal 2004, as part of our acquisition of Spinnaker, we
    acquired approximately $52,000 and $12,000 of federal and state
    net operating losses, respectively, and $2,700 of federal tax
    credits that were realized as deferred

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

tax assets upon acquisition. We also established a valuation
    allowance of $2,400 against a portion of the state net operating
    loss carryforwards of Spinnaker which if utilized will be
    treated as a reduction of acquired goodwill.

During fiscal 2006, as part of our acquisition of Alacritus, we
    acquired approximately $6,100 of federal net operating losses
    and $50 of federal tax credits that were realized as deferred
    tax assets upon acquisitions.

During fiscal 2006, as part of our acquisition of Decru, we
    acquired approximately $32,100 of federal net operating losses
    and $1,100 of federal tax credits that were realized as deferred
    tax assets upon acquisition. We also established valuation
    reserves of $1,200 and $1,200 against all of Decru’s state
    net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credit
    carryforwards, respectively, that existed as of the acquisition
    date. If utilized, these attributes will be treated as a
    reduction of acquired goodwill.

During fiscal 2007, as part of our acquisition of Topio, we
    acquired approximately $17,900 and $15,400 of federal and state
    net operating losses, respectively, that were realized as
    deferred tax assets upon acquisition.

During fiscal 2008, as part of our acquisition of Onaro, we
    acquired approximately $5,900 and $7,100 of federal and state
    net operating losses, respectively, that were realized as
    deferred tax assets upon acquisition.

Under SFAS No. 131,

“Disclosures about
    Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,”

we
    operate in one reportable industry segment: the design,
    manufacturing, marketing, and technical support of
    high-performance networked storage solutions. We market our
    products in the U.S. and in foreign countries through our
    sales personnel and our subsidiaries. The Company’s Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer are considered our
    Chief Operating Decision Makers (“CODMs”), as defined
    by SFAS No. 131. The CODMs evaluates resource
    allocation decisions and operational performance based upon
    revenue by geographic regions. Under SFAS No. 131, we
    have one reportable segment, as our three geographic operating
    segments can be aggregated into one reportable segment as they
    have similar operating characteristics. For fiscal years 2008,
    2007, and 2006, we recorded revenue from customers throughout
    the U.S. and Canada, Europe, Latin America, Australia, and
    Asia Pacific.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, and restricted
    cash and investments reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
    approximate their fair value. Our short-term investments and
    foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value based on
    quoted market prices. Other investments in nonmarketable
    securities are included in long-term investments and restricted
    cash at April 25, 2008, and April 27, 2007, with total
    carrying value of $11,169 and $8,932, which approximate their
    fair values. The fair value of our debt also approximates its
    carrying value as of April 25, 2008, and April 27,
    2007.

We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative
    or trading purposes. We enter into forward foreign exchange and
    currency option contracts to hedge trade and intercompany
    receivables and payables as well as future sales and operating
    expenses against future movement in foreign exchange rates.

Foreign currency forward contracts obligate us to buy or sell
    foreign currencies at a specified future date. Option contracts
    give us the right to buy or sell foreign currencies and are
    exercised only when economically beneficial. As of
    April 25, 2008, we had $419,289 of outstanding foreign
    exchange contracts that all had remaining maturities of five
    months or less. As of April 27, 2007, we had $367,479 of
    outstanding foreign exchange contracts (including $21,703 of
    option contracts). For the balance sheet hedges, these contracts
    are adjusted to fair value at the end of each month and are
    included in earnings. The premiums paid on the foreign currency
    option contracts are recognized as a reduction to other income
    when the contract is entered into. For cash flow hedges, the
    related gains or losses are included in other comprehensive
    income. Gains and losses on these foreign exchange contracts are
    offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and
    liabilities. At April 25, 2008, and April 27, 2007,
    the estimated notional fair value of forward foreign exchange
    contracts were $419,264 and $368,807, respectively. The fair
    value of foreign exchange contracts is based on prevailing
    financial market information.

Acquisition
    of Onaro

On January 28, 2008, we acquired Onaro, Inc.
    (“Onaro”), a privately-held company based in Boston,
    Massachusetts, that provides software solutions for enterprises
    to increase service quality, return on storage, and compliance
    by managing storage as a service. The acquisition will give our
    customers access to new storage service management and change
    management capabilities. It will allow us to help enterprise
    organizations increase data center and storage network
    efficiencies by proactively managing and optimizing storage
    service levels for availability and performance in dynamic data
    center environments, using our cost-effective and highly
    scalable modular storage systems.

Goodwill of $79,211 was recorded in connection with our
    acquisition of Onaro. The acquisition of Onaro helps extend our
    vision and strategy for integrated data management and storage
    efficiency in the data center. We plan to further develop and
    extend Onaro’s service management software technologies and
    build upon the foundation that the Onaro’s software
    provides. In addition, Onaro has an experienced and
    knowledgeable workforce and an existing infrastructure. These
    opportunities, along with the ability to leverage the Onaro
    workforce, were primary contributing factors to the
    establishment of the purchase price, resulting in the
    recognition of a significant amount of goodwill. The fair values
    assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed are based on management estimates and
    assumptions, and other information compiled by management that
    utilized established valuation techniques appropriate for the
    high-technology industry. Goodwill recorded as a result of this
    acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

The net deferred income tax liability of $11,709 recorded in
    connection with this acquisition is comprised of deferred tax
    assets of $2,893, primarily related to net operating losses
    incurred from inception through the acquisition date and a
    deferred tax liability of $14,602 related to acquired intangible
    assets.



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of the acquisition date, no amounts were allocated to
    in-process research and development. In-process research and
    development is dependent on the status of new projects on the
    date the acquisition is consummated. Prior to the acquisition
    date, Onaro had released new versions of its software products.
    Accordingly, there were no substantive research and development
    projects in process on the date the acquisition was consummated.

Acquisition
    of Topio

On December 7, 2006, we acquired Topio, Inc.
    (“Topio”), a privately-held company based in
    Santa Clara, California, that developed and sold
    enterprise-class software for data replication and rapid
    recovery across the spectrum of locations, platforms and storage
    that support an enterprise. The acquisition will continue to
    expand our data protection portfolio and simplify the
    replication of data from other storage arrays to our storage
    systems.

Goodwill of $114,700 was recorded in connection with our
    acquisition of Topio. The current and future potential of the
    Topio technology will enable us to expand our data protection
    portfolio and simplify the replication of data from other
    storage arrays to our storage systems. In addition, Topio has an
    experienced and knowledgeable workforce and an existing
    infrastructure. These opportunities, along with the ability to
    leverage the Topio workforce, were significant contributing
    factors to the establishment of the purchase price, resulting in
    the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill. The fair
    values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed are based on management estimates and
    assumptions, and other information compiled by management that
    utilized established valuation techniques appropriate for the
    high-technology industry. Goodwill recorded as a result of this
    acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

The net deferred income tax liability of $5,150 recorded in
    connection with this acquisition is comprised of deferred tax
    assets of $7,644 primarily related to net operating losses
    incurred from inception through the acquisition date and a
    deferred tax liability of $12,794 related to acquired intangible
    assets.

Because Topio had recently introduced its products, no amount
    was allocated to in-process research and development.

Acquisition
    of Decru

On August 26, 2005, we completed our acquisition of Decru,
    Inc. (“Decru”), a Delaware corporation that developed
    and sold encryption software and appliances which encrypt
    network data.

Goodwill of $192,894 was generated in connection with our
    acquisition of Decru. The current and future potential for
    Decru’s technology will enable us to help our customers
    manage their risk of data theft and corruption with data
    encryption and authentication products. In addition, Decru has
    an experienced and knowledgeable workforce and an existing
    infrastructure. These opportunities, along with the ability to
    leverage the Decru workforce, were significant contributing
    factors to the establishment of the purchase price, resulting in
    the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill. The fair
    values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed are based on management estimates and
    assumptions, and other information compiled by management that
    utilized established valuation techniques appropriate for the
    high-technology industry. Goodwill recorded as a result of this
    acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Of the total purchase price, $5,000 was allocated to in-process
    research and development (“IPR&D”) and was
    expensed in fiscal 2006. Projects that qualify as IPR&D
    represent those that have not yet reached technological
    feasibility and which have no alternative future use.
    Technological feasibility is established when an enterprise has
    completed all planning, designing, coding, and testing
    activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be
    produced to meet its design specifications including functions,
    features, and technical performance requirement. The value of
    IPR&D was determined by estimating the stage of completion
    and risk associated with IPR&D to determine the level of
    discount rate to be applied, estimating costs to develop the
    purchased IPR&D into commercially viable products,
    estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when
    completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present
    value based on the percentage of completion of the IPR&D

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in fiscal 2007,
    we recorded the intrinsic value, measured as the difference
    between the grant price and fair market value on the acquisition
    consummation date, of unvested options and restricted stock
    units assumed in the Decru acquisition as deferred stock
    compensation in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 44,

“Accounting for Certain Transactions involving Stock
    Compensation.”

Such deferred stock compensation which
    aggregated $18,549 for Decru, was recorded as a separate
    component of stockholders’ equity in the accompanying
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. As required by
    SFAS No. 123R, we eliminated all unamortized deferred
    stock compensation related to the Decru acquisition on
    April 29, 2006.

Acquisition
    of Alacritus

On May 2, 2005, we acquired Alacritus, Inc., a
    privately-held company based in Pleasanton, California, that
    developed and sold disk-based virtual tape library software for
    data protection solutions.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in fiscal 2007,
    we recorded the intrinsic value of unvested options and
    restricted stock units assumed in the Alacritus acquisition as
    deferred stock compensation in accordance with FASB
    Interpretation No. 44,

“Accounting for Certain
    Transactions involving Stock Compensation,”

Such
    deferred stock compensation, which aggregated $1,199 for
    Alacritus, is recorded as a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity in the accompanying Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. As required by SFAS No. 123R, we
    eliminated all unamortized deferred stock compensation related
    to the Alacritus acquisition on April 29, 2006.

Goodwill
    Adjustment

During fiscal 2008, we decreased goodwill by $213 relating to
    escrow funds received from the Topio purchase transaction.
    During fiscal 2006, we decreased goodwill by $3,498 and $2,061
    relating to the tax benefits associated with the subsequent
    exercise of previously vested assumed Spinnaker and Decru
    options, respectively.

Restructuring
    Charges

In fiscal 2002, we implemented a restructuring plan related to
    the closure of an engineering facility and consolidation of
    resources to our Sunnyvale headquarters. In fiscal 2006, we
    implemented a restructuring plan related to the move of our
    global services center operations from Sunnyvale to our new
    flagship support center at our Research Triangle Park facility
    in North Carolina.

Our restructuring estimates are reviewed and revised
    periodically and may result in a substantial charge or reduction
    to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail
    than were anticipated in previous management estimates. Such
    estimates included various assumptions such as the time period
    over which the facilities will be vacant, expected sublease
    terms, and expected sublease rates. In fiscal 2008, we recorded
    charges of $447 to the restructuring reserve resulting from a
    change in the estimated operating expenses and rent escalations
    related to our 2002 restructuring plan.

Goodwill
    and Purchased Intangible Assets

Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,”

goodwill attributable to each of
    our reporting units is required to be tested for impairment by
    comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its
    carrying value. Our reporting units are the same as our
    operating units. On an ongoing basis, goodwill is reviewed
    annually for impairment (or more frequently if indicators of
    impairment arise). As of April 25, 2008, and April 27,
    2007, respectively, there had been no impairment of goodwill and
    intangible assets. Goodwill balance is summarized as follows:

    the allocation of the purchase price. During fiscal 2006, we
    decreased goodwill by $3,498 relating to the tax benefits
    associated with the subsequent exercise of previously vested
    assumed Spinnaker options. During fiscal 2007 we acquired Topio
    and recorded goodwill of $114,700 resulting from the allocation
    of the purchase price. In fiscal 2007, we also recorded a
    reduction of goodwill of $1,179 in connection with the NetCache
    divestiture in fiscal 2007. See Note 16,
    “Divestiture.” In fiscal 2008, we acquired Onaro and
    recorded goodwill of $79,211 resulting from the allocation of
    the purchase price and decreased goodwill by $213 in connection
    with Topio.

Our acquired patents are intended to enhance our technology base

    network, and fabric-attached storage systems for the benefit of
    our enterprise customers. The costs of such patents for use in
    research and development activities that have alternative future
    uses have been capitalized and amortized over an estimated
    useful life of five years as research and development expenses.

Existing technology is amortized as cost of product revenue.
    Trademarks, tradenames, customer contracts and relationships are
    amortized as sales and marketing expenses. Covenants not to
    compete are amortized over as general and administrative
    expenses.

Based on the identified intangible assets (including patents)

Guarantees

As of April 25, 2008, our financial guarantees consisted of
    standby letters of credit outstanding, bank guarantees, and
    restricted cash and investments which were related to loan
    collateral, facility lease requirements, service performance
    guarantees, customs and duties guarantees, VAT requirements, and
    workers’ compensation plans. The maximum amount of
    potential future payments under these arrangements was $253,350
    as of April 25, 2008, of which $2,953 and $247,234 were
    collateralized as short-term and long-term restricted cash and



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

investments, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets,
    and $3,163 were amounts outstanding under our commercial
    commitments (see Note 4). The maximum amount of potential
    future payments under these arrangements was $125,315 as of
    April 27, 2007, of which $121,951 was collateralized as
    restricted cash and investment on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets, and $3,364 were amounts outstanding under our commercial
    commitments.

As of April 25, 2008, our notional fair value of foreign
    exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled
    $419,264. We do not believe that these derivatives present
    significant credit risks, because the counterparties to the
    derivatives consist of major financial institutions, and we
    manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any
    one counterparty. We do not enter into derivative financial
    instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Other than the
    risk associated with the financial condition of the
    counterparties, our maximum exposure related to foreign currency
    forward and option contracts is limited to the premiums paid.

We have both recourse and nonrecourse lease financing
    arrangements with third party leasing companies through
    preexisting relationships with the customers. We sell our
    products directly to the leasing company, and the lease
    arrangement is made between our customer and the leasing
    company. Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally
    three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid
    remaining lease payments to the third party leasing company in
    the event that any customers default. For these recourse
    arrangements, revenue on the sale of our product to the leasing
    company is deferred and recognized into income as payments to
    the leasing company come due. As of April 25, 2008, and
    April 27, 2007, the maximum recourse exposure under such
    leases totaled approximately $24,842 and $10,262, respectively.
    Under the terms of the nonrecourse leases we do not have any
    continuing obligations or liabilities. To date, we have not
    experienced significant losses under this lease financing
    program.

We enter into standard indemnification agreements in the
    ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, we
    agree to defend and indemnify the other party —
    primarily our customers or business partners or subcontractors
    — for damages and reasonable costs incurred in any
    suit or claim brought against them alleging that our products
    sold to them infringe any U.S. patent, copyright, trade
    secret, or similar right. If a product becomes the subject of an
    infringement claim, we may, at our option: (i) replace the
    product with another noninfringing product that provides
    substantially similar performance; (ii) modify the
    infringing product so that it no longer infringes but remains
    functionally equivalent; (iii) obtain the right for the
    customer to continue using the product at our expense and for
    the reseller to continue selling the product; (iv) take
    back the infringing product and refund to customer the purchase
    price paid less depreciation amortized on a straight-line basis.
    We have not been required to make material payments pursuant to
    these provisions historically.

We have not recorded any liability at April 25, 2008, and
    April 27, 2007, respectively, related to these guarantees
    since the maximum amount of potential future payments under such
    guarantees, indemnities and warranties is not determinable,
    other than as described above.

16.

Divestiture

On September 11, 2006, we completed the sale of certain
    assets of our NetCache product line to Blue Coat and agreed not
    to compete in the market served by NetCache for a period of no
    less than three years from and after September 11, 2006. We
    received $23,914 in cash and 360 shares of Blue Coat’s
    common stock with a fair value of $4,637 as of
    September 11, 2006. In addition, we accrued $2,032 for
    costs expected to be incurred to fulfill our engineering and
    service contractual obligations. Because of these continuing
    obligations, the NetCache sale does not qualify for presentation
    as a discontinued operation. As a result of this divestiture, we
    recorded a pre-tax gain of $25,339 in our income from operations
    and a reduction of goodwill of $1,179. We recorded revenues of
    $57,421 and $71,106 from NetCache products for fiscal 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The contribution to operating income from
    these products was not significant.

Subsequent
    Event

On June 10, 2008, we issued $1,265,000 aggregate principal
    amount of 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the
    “Notes”) to initial purchasers who resold the Notes to
    qualified institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A
    under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The net proceeds
    from the offering, after deducting the initial purchasers’
    discount and offering expenses of $26,500, were $1,238,500. We
    used (i) $273,644 of the net proceeds to purchase
    11,600 shares of our common stock in negotiated
    transactions with institutional investors and (ii) $254,898
    of the net proceeds to enter into the note hedge transaction
    described below.

The Notes are convertible into the right to receive cash in an
    amount up to the principal amount and shares of our common stock
    for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, if
    any, at an initial conversion rate of 31.4006 shares of
    common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject to
    adjustment as described in the indenture governing the Notes,
    which represents an initial conversion price of $31.85 per
    share. The Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of
    NetApp, and interest will be payable in arrears on June 1 and
    December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2008, in
    cash at a rate of 1.75% per annum, and will be convertible upon
    satisfaction of certain conditions. The Notes will mature on
    June 1, 2013 unless earlier repurchased or converted.

Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into note
    hedge transactions (the “Note Hedges”) with certain
    financial institutions, which are designed to mitigate potential
    dilution from the conversion of the Notes in the event that the
    market value per share of our common stock at the time of
    exercise is greater than $31.85 per share, subject to
    adjustments. The Note Hedges cover, subject to anti-dilution
    adjustments, the net shares of our common stock that would be
    deliverable to converting Noteholders in the event of a
    conversion of the Notes. The Note Hedges expire at the earlier
    of (i) the last day on which any Notes remain outstanding
    and (ii) the scheduled trading day immediately preceding
    the maturity date of the Notes. We also entered into separate
    warrant transactions whereby we sold to the same financial
    institutions warrants (the “Warrants”) to acquire,
    subject to anti-dilution adjustments, 39,700 shares of our
    common stock at an exercise price of $41.28 per share, subject
    to adjustment, on a series of days commencing on
    September 3, 2013. Upon exercise of the Warrants, we have
    the option to deliver cash or shares of our common stock equal
    to the difference between the then market price and the strike
    price of the Warrants.

If the market value per share of our common stock at the time of
    conversion of the Convertible Notes is above the strike price of
    the Note Hedges, the Note Hedges will generally entitle us to
    receive net shares of our common stock (and cash for any
    fractional share amount) based on the excess of the then current
    market price of our common stock over the strike price of the
    Note Hedges, which is designed to offset any shares that we may
    have to deliver to the Note Holders. Additionally, at the time
    of exercise of the Warrants, if the market price of our common
    stock exceeds the strike price of the Warrants, we will owe the
    option counterparties net shares of our common stock (and cash
    for any fractional share amount) or cash in an amount based on
    the excess of the then current market price of our common stock
    over the strike price of the Warrants.

The separate Note Hedge and Warrant transactions, taken
    together, were structured to reduce the potential future share
    dilution associated with the conversion of Notes. The cost of
    the Note Hedge transactions to us was $254,898, and
    $152,200 net of deferred tax benefits, and has been
    accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with EITF

No. 00-19,

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
    to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock”
    (EITF

No. 00-

19). We received proceeds of $163,059 related to the sale of the
    Warrants, which has also been classified as equity because the
    instruments meet all of the equity classification criteria
    within EITF

No. 00-19.

In accordance with SFAS 128, the Notes will have no impact
    on diluted earnings per share until the price of our common
    stock exceeds the conversion price (initially $31.85 per share)
    because the principal amount of the Notes will be settled in
    cash upon conversion. Prior to conversion, we will include the
    effect of the additional shares that may be issued if our common
    stock price exceeds the conversion price, using the treasury
    stock method.

Also, in accordance with SFAS 128, the warrants will have
    no impact on earnings per share until our common stock share
    price exceeds $41.28. Prior to exercise, we will include the
    effect of additional shares that may be issued using the
    treasury stock method. The Note Hedge transactions are
    anti-dilutive and therefore will have no impact on earnings per
    share.



NETAPP,

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The FASB recently issued a new FSP No. APB

14-1

“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlements)”

. Under the final FSP, cash settled
    convertible securities will be separated into their debt and
    equity components. This change in methodology will adversely
    affect the calculations of our net income and earnings per share
    for cash settled convertible securities. We will be required to
    adopt this FSP in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. This final
    FSP will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.
    See Note 2 for further discussion.

We will incur interest expense of 1.75%, per annum on the
    outstanding principal amount of the Notes, which is estimated to
    be $22,138 per year. We incurred debt issuance costs of $26,500
    which will be capitalized and amortized to interest expense over
    the term of the Notes. The amortization of these fees will
    result in a charge to interest expense of $5,300 per year.

We have prepared the following unaudited pro forma summary
    consolidated balance sheet information as of April 25, 2008
    which gives effect to the above transactions as if they occurred

Controls
    and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls are procedures designed to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under
    the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure Controls are also
    designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and
    communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the
    end of the period covered by this report (the “Evaluation
    Date”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the
    Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective such that the information relating to NetApp,
    including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be
    disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) reports (i) is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
    rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated
    to NetApp’s management, including our principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow
    timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b)

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its
    inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
    may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
    any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
    the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
    in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that,
    as of April 25, 2008, our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective based on those criteria.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of April 25, 2008 has been audited by
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is
    included herein.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with
    management’s evaluation during our last fiscal quarter that
    have materially effected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    effect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

NetApp, Inc.

Sunnyvale, California

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    NetApp, Inc. (formerly “Network Appliance, Inc.”) and
    subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of
    April 25, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risks, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    April 25, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial
    statement schedule as of and for the year ended April 25,
    2008 of the Company and our report dated June 24, 2008
    expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements
    and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory
    paragraph regarding the adoption of Financial Accounting
    Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an Interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109.
