Classes of Data

NetApp products and solutions are based on the
premise that not all data is created equal. Enterprise customers
face a significant challenge in designing networked storage
infrastructures that balance the availability requirements of
their applications and associated data with the cost of the
storage solution. Storing all data on an expensive, monolithic,
mainframe-class array is no longer acceptable and customers want
to carefully evaluate the value of their information. As a
result, data is being classified by availability and performance
requirements in relation to cost.



•

Compliance data.

These assets represent much of the corporate or personal data
    related to conducting business, performing research, buying and
    selling securities, or other mission-critical, fiduciary, or
    private activities. This information, like any hard asset, needs
    to be protected, monitored, maintained, exchanged, and secured.

•

Reference data.

Types of reference data include e-mail archives; bank,
    brokerage, and billing statements; medical images and records;
    mechanical computer aided design (“MCAD”) drawings;
    integrated chip designs; and seismic and satellite data.
    Customers require fast data access at costs comparable to much
    slower high-end tape or optical libraries, with minimal ongoing
    management costs.

•

Archive data.

Enterprises require a low-cost storage solution for archive data
    and backups, which have historically been stored on magnetic
    tape. Many customers are now augmenting magnetic tape and
    storing these classes of data on more flexible disk-based
    systems which reduces backup windows and enables rapid recovery
    in the event of a disaster.

Network Appliance solutions meet the needs of
archive, reference, departmental/remote office, business
internal, business operations, and business critical data with a
common product architecture and data management methodology,
enabling customers to easily deploy and manage all their
networked storage infrastructure in the same way.

System Products

NetApp products consist of fabric-attached
storage (“FAS”) appliances, also known as filers,
NearStore® systems, NetCache® content delivery
appliances, the Data ONTAP

TM

operating system, our
WAFL file management system, data management and content
delivery software, and NetApp Global Services. Our configured
appliances range in price from $4,000 to more than $1,000,000.

The NetApp solution runs on a common architecture
across all NetApp systems, allowing for optimal scalability and
increased flexibility. Customers can protect their existing
investments and consolidate both compliance and
non-compliance-related data on a single platform, helping to
simplify compliance management and reduce storage costs. Through
open standards, NetApp helps ensure rapid application deployment
and smooth integration into its customers’ existing
infrastructure. Our data management features help provide you
simple management, improved data protection, and reduced
operational costs.

All NetApp systems come packaged in
rack-mountable enclosures that can be installed in a
customer’s existing server racks or can be
factory-installed and configured in cabinets. Our appliances are
based primarily on commodity hardware, including Intel®
Pentium® processors, an advanced implementation of the
industry-standard PCI bus architecture, standard Ethernet
adapters, and either Fibre Channel-Arbitrated Loop
(“FC-AL”), Advanced Technology Attachment
(“ATA”), or Small Computer System Interface
(“SCSI”) disk interconnects.

Filers

NetApp filers are scalable, highly available,
unified networked storage systems for data storage and
simplifying data management. They are specifically designed for
highly scalable, network-centric IT system architectures, and
support both network-attached storage (“NAS”) and
storage-attached networks (“SAN”) on a single, unified
platform. Our filers are designed for and deliver lower total
cost of ownership than alternative competitive systems.
Heterogeneous data sharing allows our systems to deliver
simultaneous data access to Linux, UNIX, Windows, and Web-based
servers and clients, dramatically lowering the total cost of
ownership and management complexity versus homogeneous storage
systems. Filers are available in either single-node
configurations or fully redundant, active/active cluster
configurations that provide high data availability for
business-critical environments.



Current filer products include:

Gateway Filers

The Network Appliance gFiler

TM

is an
innovative gateway storage solution that provides unified SAN
and NAS access to data stored in Fibre Channel SAN storage
arrays from other storage vendors. The gFiler enables superior
consolidation and storage management in data center storage
deployment for an expanded set of business solutions. Like all
NetApp storage appliances, the gFiler is based on the Data ONTAP
microkernel operating system, which supports multiprotocol data
access services and advanced data management capabilities for
consolidating, protecting, and recovering mission-critical data
for enterprise applications and users.



Current gateway filer products include:

The gFiler series supports multiple enterprise
storage systems including the Hitachi Data Systems Freedom
Storage

TM

systems, the Hitachi Limited SANRISE
storage systems, and the IBM TotalStorage Enterprise Storage
Server series. The gFiler series for Hitachi Freedom Storage is
available exclusively through Hitachi Data Systems and its
authorized resellers.

NearStore Systems

NetApp NearStore products are designed for
improving data backup and recovery architectures, storing
reference and regulated data, and archiving infrequently
accessed files. NearStore systems back up and restore data with
speed, consistency, ease of use, and scalability, particularly
compared to tape-based backup/restore solutions. The product
complements and improves upon existing tape backup processes by
inserting economical and simple-to-use disk-based storage
between application storage and tape libraries, resulting in an
efficient two-stage backup configuration. Almost any type of
primary storage can be backed up to NearStore systems, including
UNIX, Linux, and Windows servers with direct-attached or
SAN-attached storage from all other storage vendors, desktop and
notebook computers, and NetApp filers. NearStore can also be
used as a replication target within a data center, or for
replicating data from remotely distributed offices or branches
to a central location in a fully heterogeneous,
platform-independent architecture.

NearStore systems are also ideal for
consolidating nearline data resources, including reference and
archive data into a single storage platform. This platform can
be located and managed centrally, thus reducing costs associated
with data center operations.

With the advent of Rule 17a-4 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”) and HIPAA as well as several governmental defense
requirements, NearStore, in conjunction with NetApp
SnapLock

TM

software, has become part of an open
access data-retention solution targeted at regulated data
industries, such as financial services, healthcare,
pharmaceuticals, and government.

Our current NearStore product, the R200, is
available in system capacities scaling from 8TB to 96TB, and
provides full fabric-attached storage connectivity via FCP,
iSCSI, and NAS protocols.

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financials
Statements accompanying this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Seasonality

Although operating results have not been
materially and adversely affected by seasonality in the past,
because of the significant seasonal effects experienced within
the industry, particularly in Europe, our future operating
results could be materially adversely affected by seasonality.
See “Risk Factors — Factors beyond our control
could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate” and
“Risks inherent in our international operations could have
a material adverse effect on our operating results”
accompanying this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Sales and Marketing

Network Appliance markets and distributes
products globally in over 100 countries employing a multichannel
distribution strategy, which focuses on product sales to end
users through a direct sales force, value-added resellers,
system integrators, original equipment manufacturers
(“OEMs”) and distributors. In North America, we employ
all forms of distribution previously mentioned, with a focus on
direct sales to our strategic and named accounts. In Europe, we
employ a mix of resellers and direct sales channels to sell to
end users. In Asia, Africa and South America, our products are
primarily sold through resellers, which are supported by channel
sales representatives and technical support personnel. No single
customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales in fiscal 2004,
2003, or 2002.

Backlog

Network Appliance manufactures products based on
a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of
our customers’ demand. Orders are generally placed by
customers on an as-needed basis. Products are typically shipped
within one to four weeks following receipt of an order. In
certain circumstances, customers may cancel or reschedule orders
without penalty. For these reasons, “orders” may not
constitute a firm backlog and may not be a meaningful indicator
of revenues.

Manufacturing

Manufacturing operations, with insourced and
outsourced locations in Sunnyvale, California, San Jose,
California, and Livingston, Scotland, include materials
procurement, commodity management, component engineering, test
engineering, manufacturing engineering, product assembly,
product assurance, quality control, and final test. We rely on
many suppliers for materials, as well as several key
subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and
finished systems. Our strategy has been to develop close
relationships with our suppliers, exchanging critical
information and implementing joint quality-training programs. We
also use contract manufacturers for the production of major
subassemblies to improve our manufacturing redundancy. See
“Risk Factors — We rely on a limited number of
suppliers” and “Risk Factors — The loss of
our contract manufacturers.” This manufacturing strategy
minimizes capital investment and overhead expenditures and
creates flexibility for rapid expansion. We were awarded the ISO
9001 certification on May 29, 1997, ISO 9001:2000 on
December 3, 2003, and continue to be ISO 9001:2000
certified.

Research and Development

During fiscal year 2004, Network Appliance
strengthened the unified storage platform product line to
support both SAN and NAS simultaneously. We introduced a number
of new systems, including the FAS250 and FAS270 filers, the
FAS980 high-end filers, the NetCache C6200, and the NearStore
R200, which continues to define a new category of storage
solution. The gFiler for Hitachi has been extended and the
product line now also includes IBM storage support. We also
introduced newer versions of existing software products that
continue to improve data management capabilities, provide new
solutions in the areas of data protection and backup and
recovery, and enable new business continuance functionality. We
have also



strengthened our engineering partnerships and
collaboration with Veritas, Brocade, McData, Hitachi Data
Systems (“HDS”) and others. We completed our
acquisition of Spinnaker Networks, Inc. (“Spinnaker”)
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, which will accelerate the
delivery of the NetApp Storage Grid architecture, enabling
customers to obtain more value from their storage and data
infrastructures.

See “Risk Factors — If we are
unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to
technological change, or if our new products do not achieve
market acceptance, our operating results could be materially
adversely affected.”

Competition

The storage and content delivery markets are
intensely competitive, and are characterized by rapidly changing
technology.

In the storage market, our FAS appliances and
associated storage software portfolio competes primarily with
storage system products and data management software from EMC
Corporation, Hitachi Data Systems, Hewlett-Packard Company
(including the integrated Compaq Computer Corporation), IBM
Corporation, and Sun Microsystems, Inc. We have also
historically encountered less-frequent competition from
companies including Dell, Engenio Information Technologies, Inc.
(formerly the Storage Systems Group of LSI Logic Corp.),
StorageTek Technology Corporation, Silicon Graphics, Inc., and
Xiotech Corporation. In the nearline storage market, which
includes the disk-to-disk backup and regulated data storage
segments, our NearStore appliances compete primarily against
products from EMC and StorageTek. Our NearStore appliances also
compete indirectly with traditional tape backup solutions in the
broader data backup/recovery space.

In the content delivery market, our NetCache
appliances and content delivery software compete against caching
appliance and content delivery software vendors including
BlueCoat Systems (formerly CacheFlow, Inc.), and Cisco Systems,
Inc. Our NetCache business is also subject to indirect
competition from content delivery service products such as those
offered by Akamai Technologies.

Additionally, a number of new, privately held
companies are currently attempting to enter the storage systems
and data management software markets, the nearline storage
market, and the caching and content delivery markets, some of
which may become significant competitors in the future. We
believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the
storage and content delivery markets include product benefits
such as response time, reliability, data availability,
scalability, ease of use, price, multiprotocol capabilities, and
customer service and support.

See “Risk Factors — An increase in
competition could materially adversely affect our operating
results” and “If we are unable to develop and
introduce new products and respond to technological change, or
if our new products do not achieve market acceptance.”

Proprietary Rights

We currently rely on a combination of copyright
and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures,
contractual provisions, and patents to protect our proprietary
rights. We seek to protect our software, documentation, and
other written materials under trade secret, copyright, and
patent laws, which afford only limited protection. We have
registered our Network Appliance name and logo, DataFabric,
FAServer, FilerView, NearStore, NetApp, NetCache, SecureShare
SnapManager, SnapMirror, SnapRestore, and WAFL and others as
trademarks in the U.S. Other U.S. trademarks and some
of the other U.S. registered trademarks are registered
internationally as well. We will continue to evaluate the
registration of additional trademarks as appropriate. We
generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our
employees, resellers, and customers. We currently have multiple
U.S. and international patent applications pending and multiple
U.S. patents issued. See “Risk Factors — If
we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may be
subject to increased competition that could materially adversely
affect our operating results.”



Employees

As of April 30, 2004, we had 2,844
employees. Of the total, 1,421 were in sales and marketing, 650
in research and development, 331 in finance and administration,
and 442 in manufacturing and customer service operations. Our
future performance depends in significant part on our key
technical and senior management personnel, none of whom is bound
by an employment agreement. We have never had a work stoppage
and consider relations with our employees to be good.

Risk Factors

The following risk factors and other
information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties
described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks
and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently
deem less significant may also impair our business operations.
Please see page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
for additional discussion of these forward-looking statements.
If any of the following risks actually occur, our business,
operating results, and financial condition could be materially
adversely affected.

Factors beyond our control could cause our
    quarterly results to fluctuate.

We believe that period-to-period comparisons of
our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and
should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance.
Many of the factors that could cause our quarterly operating
results to fluctuate significantly in the future are beyond our
control and include, but are not limited to, the following:



In addition, sales for any future quarter may
vary and accordingly be inconsistent with our plans. We
manufacture products based on a combination of specific order
requirements and forecasts of our customer demands. Products are
typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of
an order. In certain circumstances, customers may cancel or
reschedule orders without penalty. Product sales are also
difficult to forecast because the network storage market is
rapidly evolving and our sales cycle varies substantially from
customer to customer.

Due to all of the foregoing factors, it is
possible that in one or more future quarters our results may
fall below the expectations of public market analysts and
investors. In such event, the trading price of our common stock
would likely decrease.

Our gross margins may vary based on the
    configuration of our product and service solutions, and such
    variation may make it more difficult to forecast our
    earnings.

We derive a significant portion of our sales from
the resale of disk drives as components of our filers, and the
resale market for hard disk drives is highly competitive and
subject to intense pricing pressures. Our sales of disk drives
generate lower gross margin percentages than those of our filer
products. As a result, as we sell more highly configured systems
with greater disk drive content, overall gross margin
percentages may be negatively affected.

Our gross margins have been and may continue to
be affected by a variety of other factors, including:



•

excess inventory purchase commitments as a result
    of changes in demand forecasts and possible product and software
    defects as we transition our products; and

•

the cost of components, manufacturing labor, and
    quality.

Changes in service gross margin may result from
various factors such as continued investments in our customer
support infrastructure, changes in the mix between technical
support services and professional services, as well as the
timing of technical support service contract initiations and
renewals.

A significant percentage of our expenses
    are fixed, which could materially and adversely affect our net
    income.

Our expense levels are based in part on our
expectations as to future sales and a significant percentage of
our expenses are fixed. As a result, if sales levels are below
expectations or previously higher levels, net income will be
disproportionately affected in a material and adverse manner.

If we fail to manage our expanding business
    effectively our operating results could be materially adversely
    affected.

We have experienced growth in fiscal 2004. Our
future operating results depend to a large extent on
management’s ability to successfully manage expansion and
growth, including but not limited to expanding international
operations, forecasting revenues, addressing new markets,
controlling expenses, implementing infrastructure and systems
and managing our assets. In addition, an unexpected decline in
the growth rate of revenues without a corresponding and timely
reduction in expense growth or a failure to manage other aspects
of growth could materially adversely affect our operating
results.

Our future financial performance depends on
    growth in the network storage and content delivery markets. If
    these markets do not continue to grow at the rates at which we
    forecast growth, our operating results will be materially and
    adversely impacted.

All of our products address the storage and
content delivery markets. Accordingly, our future financial
performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the
storage and content delivery markets and on our ability to adapt
to emerging standards in these markets. We cannot assure you
that the markets for storage and content delivery will continue
to grow or that emerging standards in these markets will not
adversely affect the growth of UNIX, Windows, and the World Wide
Web server markets upon which we depend.

For example, we provide our open access data
retention solutions to customers within the financial services,
healthcare, pharmaceuticals and government market segments,
industries that are subject to various evolving governmental
regulations with respect to data access, reliability and
permanence (such as Rule 17(a)(4) of the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) in the United States and in
the other countries in which we operate. If our products do not
meet, and continue to comply with, these evolving governmental
regulations in this regard, customers in these market and
geographical segments will not purchase our products and,
therefore, we will not be able to expand our product offerings
in these market and geographical segments at the rates for which
we have forecast.

In addition, our business also depends on general
economic and business conditions. A reduction in demand for
network storage and content delivery caused by weakening
economic conditions and decreases in corporate spending have
resulted in decreased revenues and lower revenue growth rates.
The network storage and content delivery market growth declined
significantly beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2001,
causing both our revenues and operating results to decline. If
the network storage and content delivery markets grow more
slowly than anticipated or if emerging standards other than
those adopted by us become increasingly accepted by these
markets, our operating results could be materially adversely
affected.



The market price for our common stock has
    fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to
    do so in the future.

The market price for our common stock has
experienced substantial volatility in the past, and several
factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the
future. These factors include:

In addition, the stock market has experienced
volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of
equity securities of many technology companies. Additionally,
certain macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates,
the market climate for the technology sector, and levels of
corporate spending on information technology could also have an
impact on the trading price of our stock. As a result, the
market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in
the future and any broad market decline, as well as our own
operating results, may materially and adversely affect the
market price of our common stock.

If we are unable to develop and introduce
    new products and respond to technological change, if our new
    products do not achieve market acceptance, or if we fail to
    manage the transition between our new and old products, our
    operating results could be materially and adversely
    affected.

Our future growth depends upon the successful
development and introduction of new hardware and software
products. Due to the complexity of storage subsystems and
Internet caching devices, and the difficulty in gauging the
engineering effort required to produce new products, such
products are subject to significant technical risks. However, we
cannot assure you that any of our new products will achieve
market acceptance. Additional product introductions in future
periods may also impact our sales of existing products. In
addition, our new products must respond to technological changes
and evolving industry standards. If we are unable, for
technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new
products in a timely manner in response to changing market
conditions or customer requirements, or if such products do not
achieve market acceptance, our operating results could be
materially adversely affected.

In particular, in conjunction with the
introduction of our product offerings in the fabric-attached
storage market, we introduced products with new features and
functionality that address the storage area network market.
During fiscal 2003, we introduced iSCSI-enabled unified storage
solutions. We also introduced Direct Access File System
(“DAFS”) protocol-capable products and NearStore
backup and recovery products during fiscal 2002. We face risks
relating to these product introductions, including risks
relating to forecasting of demand for such products, as well as
possible product and software defects and a potentially
different sales and support environment associated with selling
these new systems. If any of the foregoing occur, our operating
results could be adversely affected.

As new or enhanced products are introduced, we
must successfully manage the transition from older products in
order to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering
patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories,
and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered
to meet customers’ demands.



Our business could be materially adversely
    affected as a result of a natural disaster, terrorist acts, or
    other catastrophic events.

Our operations, including our suppliers’ and
contract manufacturers’ operations, are susceptible to
outages due to fire, floods, power loss, power shortages,
telecommunications failures, break-ins, and similar events. In
addition, our headquarters are located in Northern California,
an area susceptible to earthquakes. If any significant disaster
were to occur, our ability to operate our business could be
impaired.

Weak economic conditions or terrorist actions
could lead to significant business interruptions. If such
disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders, a
general decrease in corporate spending on information
technology, or direct impacts on our marketing, manufacturing,
financial functions, or our suppliers’ logistics function,
our results of operations and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

We depend on attracting and retaining
    qualified technical and sales personnel. If we are unable to
    attract and retain such personnel, our operating results could
    be materially and adversely impacted.

Our continued success depends, in part, on our
ability to identify, attract, motivate, and retain qualified
technical and sales personnel. Because our future success is
dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce
new products, we are particularly dependent on our ability to
identify, attract, motivate, and retain qualified engineers with
the requisite education, backgrounds, and industry experience.
Competition for qualified engineers, particularly in Silicon
Valley, can be intense. The loss of the services of a
significant number of our engineers or sales people could be
disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships
and could materially adversely affect our operating results.

Risks inherent in our international
    operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating
    results.

We conduct business internationally. For fiscal
year 2004, approximately 47.1% of our total revenues was from
international customers (including U.S. exports).
Accordingly, our future operating results could be materially
adversely affected by a variety of factors, some of which are
beyond our control, including regulatory, political, or economic
conditions in a specific country or region, trade protection
measures and other regulatory requirements, government spending
patterns, and acts of terrorism and international conflicts.

Our international sales are denominated in
U.S. dollars and in foreign currencies. An increase in the
value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies
could make our products more expensive and, therefore,
potentially less competitive in foreign markets. For
international sales and expenditures denominated in foreign
currencies, we are subject to risks associated with currency
fluctuations. We hedge risks associated with foreign currency
transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in
foreign currency exchange rates on earnings. We utilize forward
and option contracts to hedge our currency exposure associated
with certain assets and liabilities as well as anticipated
foreign currency cash flow. All balance sheet hedges are marked
to market through earnings every period, while gains and losses
on cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income.
These hedges attempt to reduce, but do not always entirely
eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements. Factors
that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging
program include the accuracy of forecasts and the volatility of
foreign currency markets. There can be no assurance that such
hedging strategies will be successful and that currency exchange
rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our
operating results.

Additional risks inherent in our international
business activities generally include, among others, longer
accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing
international operations. Such factors could materially
adversely affect our future international sales and,
consequently, our operating results.

Potentially adverse tax consequences could also
negatively impact the operating and financial results from
international operations. International operations currently
benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the Netherlands. The
Dutch tax ruling, however, will expire at the end of calendar
2005. There are uncertainties associated with securing a new
Dutch tax ruling.



Additional risks inherent in our international
business activities generally include, among others, longer
accounts receivable payment cycles, difficulties in managing
international operations, and potentially adverse tax
consequences. Such factors could materially adversely affect our
future international sales and, consequently, our operating
results.

Although operating results have not been
materially adversely affected by seasonality in the past,
because of the significant seasonal effects experienced within
the industry, particularly in Europe, our future operating
results could be materially adversely affected by seasonality.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to
maintain or increase international market demand for our
products.

An increase in competition could materially
    adversely affect our operating results.

The storage and content delivery markets are
intensely competitive, and are characterized by rapidly changing
technology.

In the storage market, our FAS appliances and
associated storage software portfolio competes primarily with
storage system products and data management software from EMC
Corporation, Hitachi Data Systems, Hewlett-Packard Company
(including the integrated Compaq Computer Corporation), IBM
Corporation, and Sun Microsystems, Inc. We have also
historically encountered less-frequent competition from
companies including Dell, Engenio Information Technologies, Inc.
(formerly the Storage Systems Group of LSI Logic Corp.),
StorageTek Technology Corporation, Silicon Graphics, Inc., and
Xiotech Corporation. In the nearline storage market, which
includes the disk-to-disk backup and regulated data storage
segments, our NearStore appliances compete primarily against
products from EMC and StorageTek. Our NearStore appliances also
compete indirectly with traditional tape backup solutions in the
broader data backup/recovery space.

In the content delivery market, our NetCache
appliances and content delivery software compete against caching
appliance and content delivery software vendors including
BlueCoat Systems (formerly CacheFlow, Inc.), and Cisco Systems,
Inc. Our NetCache business is also subject to indirect
competition from content delivery service products such as those
offered by Akamai Technologies.

Additionally, a number of new, privately held
companies are currently attempting to enter the storage systems
and data management software markets, the nearline storage
market, and the caching and content delivery markets, some of
which may become significant competitors in the future.

We believe that the principal competitive factors
affecting the storage and content delivery markets include
product benefits such as response time, reliability, data
availability, scalability, ease of use, price, multiprotocol
capabilities, and global service and support. To date, we have
been able to compete successfully with our principal competitors
in large part based on the product benefits that we believe
result from the superior technology of our products. We must
continue to maintain and enhance this technological advantage
over our competitors. Otherwise, if those competitors with
greater financial, marketing, service, support, technical and
other resources were able to offer products that matched or
surpassed the technological capabilities of our products, these
competitors would, by virtue of these greater resources, gain a
competitive advantage over us that could lead to greater sales
for these competitors at the expense of our own market share,
which would have a material adverse affect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Increased competition could also result in price
reductions, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, any
of which could materially adversely affect our operating
results. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly
than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in
customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the
development, promotion, sale, and support of their products. In
addition, current and potential competitors have established or
may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with
third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors
or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire
significant market share. We cannot assure you that we will be
able to compete successfully against current or future
competitors. Competitive pressures we face could materially
adversely affect our operating results.



We rely on a limited number of suppliers,
    and any disruption or termination of these supply arrangements
    could delay shipment of our products and could materially and
    adversely affect our operating results.

We rely on a limited number of suppliers of
several key components utilized in the assembly of our products.
We purchase most of our disk drives through a single supplier.
We purchase computer boards and microprocessors from a limited
number of suppliers. Our reliance on a limited number of
suppliers involves several risks, including:

Component quality is particularly significant
with respect to our suppliers of disk drives. In order to meet
product performance requirements, we must obtain disk drives of
extremely high quality and capacity. In addition, there are
periodic supply-and-demand issues for disk drives,
microprocessors, and for semiconductor memory components, which
could result in component shortages, selective supply
allocations, and increased prices of such components. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to obtain our full requirements
of such components in the future or that prices of such
components will not increase. In addition, problems with respect
to yield and quality of such components and timeliness of
deliveries could occur. Disruption or termination of the supply
of these components could delay shipments of our products and
could materially adversely affect our operating results. Such
delays could also damage relationships with current and
prospective customers.

In addition, we license certain technology and
software from third parties that is incorporated into our
products. If we are unable to obtain or license the technology
and software on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver
products to our customers in a timely manner.

The loss of any contract manufacturers or
    the failure to accurately forecast demand for our products or
    successfully manage our relationships with our contract
    manufacturers could negatively impact our ability to manufacture
    and sell our products.

We currently rely on several contract
manufacturers to manufacture most of our products. Our reliance
on our third-party contract manufacturers reduces our control
over the manufacturing process, exposing us to risks, including
reduced control over quality assurance, production costs, and
product supply. If we should fail to effectively manage our
relationships with our contract manufacturers, or if our
contract manufacturers experience delays, disruptions, capacity
constraints, or quality control problems in their manufacturing
operations, our ability to ship products to our customers could
be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could be
harmed. Qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing
volume production are expensive and time-consuming. If we are
required to change contract manufacturers or assume internal
manufacturing operations, we may lose revenue and damage our
customer relationships. If we inaccurately forecast demand for
our products, we may have excess or inadequate inventory, or
incur cancellation charges or penalties, which could adversely
impact our operating results. As of April 30, 2004, we have
no such purchase commitment.

We intend to regularly introduce new products and
product enhancements, which will require us to rapidly achieve
volume production by coordinating with our contract
manufacturers and suppliers. We may need to increase our
material purchases, contract manufacturing capacity, and
internal test and quality functions to meet anticipated demand.
The inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with
adequate supplies of high-quality products, or the inability to
obtain raw materials, could cause a delay in our ability to
fulfill orders.



If we are unable to maintain our existing
    relationships and develop new relationships with major strategic
    partners, our revenue may be impacted negatively.

An element of our strategy to increase revenue is
to strategically partner with major third-party software and
hardware vendors that integrate our products into their products
and also comarket our products with these vendors. A number of
these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us
expanded access to segments of the storage market. There is
intense competition for attractive strategic partners, and even
if we can establish strategic relationships with these partners,
we cannot assure you that these partnerships will generate
significant revenue or that the partnerships will continue to be
in effect for any specific period of time.

We intend to continue to establish and maintain
business relationships with technology companies to accelerate
the development and marketing of our storage solutions. To the
extent we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships and
maintaining our existing relationships, our future revenue and
operating results could be impacted negatively. In addition, the
loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse effect
on the progress of our new products under development with that
partner.

We may incur problems with current or
    future equity investments and acquisitions, and these
    investments may not achieve our objectives.

From time to time, we make equity investments for
the promotion of business and strategic objectives. We have
already made strategic investments in a number of network
storage-related technology companies. Equity investments may
result in the loss of investment capital. The market price and
valuation of our equity investments in these companies may
fluctuate due to market conditions and other circumstances over
which we have little or no control. To the extent that the fair
value of these securities is less than our cost over an extended
period of time, our results of operations and financial position
could be negatively impacted. In fiscal 2003 and 2002, we
recorded non-cash write-downs of $2.0 million and
$13.0 million, respectively, related to the impairment of
our investment in publicly traded and private companies as its
reduction in value was judged to be other-than-temporary. In
fiscal 2004 and 2003, we recorded a gain of $0.7 million
and $0.8 million, respectively, related to sales of
previously impaired investments.

As part of our strategy, we are continuously
evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies
that would complement our current products, expand the breadth
of our markets, or enhance our technical capabilities. We have
acquired three companies since the beginning of fiscal 2001,
including the acquisition of Spinnaker Networks, Inc., for
approximately $306.0 million. We completed the Spinnaker
acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and have
completed integrating the acquired operations and products from
this acquisition into our operations. See
Note 11 — Business Combinations. We may engage in
future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders’
investments and cause us to use cash, to incur debt, or to
assume contingent liabilities.

Acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks,
and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired
operations and products or realize anticipated synergies,
economies of scale, or other value. In addition, we may
experience a diversion of management’s attention, the loss
of key employees of acquired operations, or the inability to
recover strategic investments in development stage entities. Any
such problems could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operation.

In addition, we adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”

which
changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method
to an impairment-only approach. As of April 30, 2004, the
fair value for each of our reporting units exceeded the
reporting unit’s carrying amount and no impairment was
recognized. On an ongoing basis, goodwill is reviewed annually
for impairment (or more frequently if indicators of impairment
arise). There had been no impairment of goodwill and intangible
assets as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. There
can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not result
in a charge to earnings.



We rely and will increasingly rely on our
    indirect sales channel for a significant portion of our revenue.
    If we are unable to effectively manage this sales channel, we
    will not be able to maintain or increase our revenue as we have
    forecasted, which would have a material adverse impact on our
    business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

We market and sell our storage solutions directly
through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through
channels such as value-added resellers (“VARs”),
systems integrators, distributors and strategic business
partners and derive a significant portion of our revenue from
these indirect channel partners. However, in order for us to
maintain our current revenue sources and grow our revenue as we
have forecasted, we must effectively manage our relationships
with these indirect channel partners. To do so, we must attract
and retain a sufficient number of qualified channel partners to
successfully market our products. However, because we also sell
our products directly to customers through our sales force, on
occasion we compete with our indirect channels for sales of our
products to our end customers, competition that could result in
conflicts with these indirect channel partners and make it
harder for us to attract and retain these indirect channel
partners. At the same time, our indirect channel partners may
develop and offer products of their own that are competitive to
ours. Or, because our reseller partners generally offer products
from several different companies, including products of our
competitors, these resellers may give higher priority to the
marketing, sales and support of our competitors’ products
than ours. If we fail to manage effectively our relationships
with these indirect channel partners to minimize channel
conflict and continue to evaluate and meet our indirect sales
partners’ needs with respect to our products, we will not
be able to maintain or increase our revenue as we have
forecasted, which would have a materially adverse affect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Undetected software, hardware errors, or
    failures found in new products may result in loss of or delay in
    market acceptance of our products, which could increase our
    costs and reduce our revenues.

Our products may contain undetected software,
hardware errors, or failures when first introduced or as new
versions are released. Despite testing by us and by current and
potential customers, errors may not be found in new products
until after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in
loss of or delay in market acceptance, which could materially
adversely affect our operating results.

If actual results or events differ
    materially from our estimates and assumptions, our reported
    financial condition and results of operation for future periods
    could be materially affected.

The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements and related disclosure in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to establish policies that contain estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
describes the significant accounting policies essential to
preparing our consolidated financial statements. The preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. We
base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that
we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
future results may differ materially from these estimates. We
evaluate, on an ongoing basis, our estimates and assumptions. In
addition, see our Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies
under Item 7.

If we are unable to protect our
    intellectual property, we may be subject to increased
    competition that could materially adversely affect our operating
    results.

Our success depends significantly upon our
proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyright
and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures,
contractual provisions, and patents to protect our proprietary
rights. We seek to protect our software, documentation, and
other written materials under trade secret, copyright, and
patent laws, which afford only limited protection. Some
U.S. trademarks and some U.S.-registered trademarks are
registered internationally as well. We will continue to evaluate
the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate. We
generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our
employees and with our resellers, strategic partners, and
customers. We currently have multiple U.S. and



international patent applications pending and
multiple U.S. patents issued. The pending applications may
not be approved and if patents are issued, such patents may be
challenged. If such challenges are brought, the patents may be
invalidated. We cannot assure you that we will develop
proprietary products or technologies that are patentable, that
any issued patent will provide us with any competitive
advantages or will not be challenged by third parties, or that
the patents of others will not materially adversely affect our
ability to do business.

Litigation may be necessary to protect our
proprietary technology. Any such litigation may be
time-consuming and costly. Despite our efforts to protect our
proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy
aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we
regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign
countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an
extent as do the laws of the U.S. We cannot assure you that
our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate
or that our competitors will not independently develop similar
technology, duplicate our products, or design around patents
issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours.

We are subject to intellectual property
infringement claims. We may, from time to time, receive claims
that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property
rights. Third parties may in the future claim infringement by us
with respect to current or future products, patents, trademarks,
or other proprietary rights. We expect that companies in the
appliance market will increasingly be subject to infringement
claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry
segment grows and the functionality of products in different
industry segments overlaps. Any such claims could be
time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product
shipment delays, require us to redesign our products or require
us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which
could materially adversely affect our operating results. Such
royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be
available on terms acceptable to us or at all.

Item 2.

Properties

Our headquarters site for corporate general
administration, sales and marketing, research and development,
global services, and manufacturing operations occupies
approximately 800,000 square feet of buildings in
Sunnyvale, California.

We lease other sales offices and research and
development facilities throughout the U.S. and internationally.
We believe that our existing facilities and those being
developed in Sunnyvale are adequate for our requirements over at
least the next two years and that additional space will be
available as needed.

As a result of reductions in headcount in fiscal
2002, we have exited office space under noncancellable leases in
both the U.S. and Europe. If we are unable to successfully
sublease our vacated and unoccupied office space, our operating
results may be adversely affected. See “Note 12 under
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.”

See additional discussion regarding properties in
“Note 4 under Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” and “Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and
litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We defend
ourselves vigorously against any such claims. While the outcome
of these matters is currently not determinable, management does
not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will
have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Item 4.

Submissions of Matters to a Vote of
    Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security
holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



PART II

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity
    and Related Stockholder Matters

Our common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq
National Market on November 21, 1995, and is traded under
the symbol “NTAP.” As of April 30, 2004, there
were 1,217 holders of record of the common stock. The following
table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low
closing sale prices for our common stock as reported on the
Nasdaq National Market.

We believe that a number of factors may cause the
market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. See
“Item 1. Business — Risk Factors.”

We have never paid cash dividends on our capital
stock. We currently anticipate retaining all available funds, if
any, to finance internal growth and product development as well
as other management initiatives, including stock repurchases and
acquisitions. Payment of dividends in the future will depend
upon our earnings and financial condition and such other factors
as the directors may consider or deem appropriate at the time.

Information regarding securities authorized for
issuance under equity compensation plans is incorporated by
reference from our Proxy Statement for the 2004 Annual Meeting
of Stockholders.

On February 18, 2004, we acquired Spinnaker
Networks, Inc. (“Spinnaker”) for approximately
$305.5 million (including transaction costs of
$3.0 million) in an all stock transaction, through the
merger of Nagano Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Network
Appliance, with and into Spinnaker (the “Merger”),
with Spinnaker to survive as the wholly-owned subsidiary of
Network Appliance. Under terms of the agreement, we acquired
Spinnaker for 12.4 million shares of common stock and
assumed options to purchase 2.9 million shares of
common stock in connection with the Spinnaker 2000 Option Plan.
We relied on an exemption under Section 3(a)(10) of the
Securities Act in issuing the unregistered securities to the
stockholders of Spinnaker. On March 1, 2004, we filed a
Form S-8 registration statement with the SEC to register
the assumed options of the Spinnaker 2000 Stock Plan.

Repurchases of common stock

On May 13, 2003, we announced that the Board
of Directors approved a $150.0 million stock repurchase
program to purchase shares of our outstanding common stock in
the open market. During fiscal 2004, we repurchased
6.9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost
of $136.2 million. The repurchases were recorded as
treasury stock and resulted in a reduction of stockholders’
equity. On May 18, 2004, we announced that the Board
authorized an expansion of the program to purchase an additional
$200.0 million of outstanding common stock. Total
authorized stock purchase spending may be up to
$350.0 million. The stock repurchase program may be
suspended or discontinued at any time. The duration of the
repurchase program is open-ended. Under the program, Network
Appliance, Inc. may purchase shares of common stock through open
market transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management.
The timing and amount of repurchase transactions under this
program will depend on market conditions and corporate and
regulatory considerations.



The purchases will be funded from available
working capital. The following table sets forth common stock
repurchases by Network Appliance for the periods indicated:

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read together with
the financial statements and the related notes set forth under
“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data.” The following discussion also contains trend
information and other forward looking statements that involve a
number of risks and uncertainties. The Risk Factors set forth in
“Item 1. Business” are hereby incorporated into
the discussion by reference.

Overview

Enterprises are generating vast quantities of
data. The volume of stored data is growing due to increased
digital content, online transaction processing and large
databases. The growth of ebusiness, and the requirements to
retain data for longer periods of time, is driving an increasing
demand for storage and data management solutions. There is an
increasing need to maintain easy access to historical
information for business or regulatory requirements. Many
companies want all data to be available online rather than
archived offline.



While the quantity of online data continues to
grow, the price of storage and storage networking hardware
continues to decline. Data growth is outpacing IT spending
growth. Companies are migrating towards modular, scalable
systems rather than large, fixed frame systems. Companies are
looking for storage systems with data management software to
help simplify data storage and reduce the total cost of
ownership. The growth in storage capacity further increases the
complexity of data management. There is a growing trend toward
consolidating storage and serving a variety of applications from
a unified storage pool.

While we believe that these trends have favorably
impacted our business, there is no assurance that the
aforementioned trends will continue or that we will achieve our
expected financial objectives. In fiscal 2004, although the data
storage market experienced growth and improved IT spending, many
of our customers remain cautious about their spending and many
of our competitors continue to struggle financially. We believe
economic conditions have improved, but are uncertain as to the
duration and strength of the economic recovery.

Overall, our revenue growth for fiscal 2004 was
primarily driven by a combination of new product innovation,
additional channel/partner opportunities, and improving IT
spending, however, we cannot assure you that revenue from our
storage and data management solutions will continue to grow at
previous rates. We also expect to experience further price
decline per petabyte for our products which may have an adverse
impact on our gross margin if not offset by favorable software
mix and higher average selling prices associated with new
products. We continue to expect our gross margin to be impacted
by factors such as, new product introductions and enhancements,
add-on software and product mix, discount level, competition and
global service investment.

We also cannot assure you that our new products
will be introduced in a timely manner to capitalize on these
trends. If we fail to respond to certain significant market
trends or if any market trends and emerging standards on which
we are basing our assumptions do not materialize as anticipated,
our business could be materially adversely affected.
Additionally, we plan to invest more resources in the people and
programs necessary to best optimize these growth opportunities.
However, we cannot assure you that such investments will achieve
our objectives. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1.

Fiscal 2004
Highlights

In fiscal 2004, we continue to enhance our
enterprise solutions, broaden our customer portfolio, extend our
channel/partner opportunities, and gain market share with our
iSCSI, unified storage, and NearStore solutions. We also
continue to win enterprise customers across all target
industries with our storage and data management solutions.

Our goal is to provide network storage solutions
and service offerings that set the standard for simplicity and
ease of operation, with what we believe to be one of the lowest
total costs of ownership. Some of the key fiscal 2004 highlights
include:

Continue to deliver innovative and
    cost-effective enterprise network storage solutions that address
    the major IT challenges that enterprises
    face.

We introduced the FAS980 and
    FAS980c, the newest members of our NetApp FAS900 platform, that
    will help us extend the NetApp unified storage systems into the
    high-end of the enterprise storage market. Also during the year,
    we introduced and shipped the NetApp NearStore R200 storage
    system and SnapVault software solution for backup, compliance,
    reference, archive and secondary data needs. We announced the
    integration of RAID-DP (double-disk parity) into our full line
    of enterprise storage systems which increases the level of data
    protection in the event of multiple storage-related disk
    failures. In addition, we announced that our NetApp gFiler
    supports unified NAS and SAN consolidation for IBM storage
    system platforms.

Continue to leverage our product capabilities
    to address emerging markets such as iSCSI and Storage
    Grid.

We reaffirmed our commitment to
    iSCSI technology by completing Microsoft Windows Hardware
    Quality lab tests for the entire NetApp product line to ensure
    that they meet Microsoft standards for iSCSI compatibility and
    interoperability with the Windows platform. As a result, our
    products now appear in the Microsoft Windows server catalog. We
    believe that Microsoft’s support of



iSCSI for the SQL server and Exchange environment
    will help encourage further iSCSI adoption within the
    enterprise. We expect our Windows business to be a strong driver
    of the growth of our block storage solutions.

We completed our acquisition of Spinnaker
    Networks, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2004. The combination of
    NetApp unified storage and data management solutions with
    advanced distributed storage technologies acquired from
    Spinnaker Networks will further our strategy to deliver Storage
    Grid solutions.

Continue to extend our channel/partner
    opportunities.

During fiscal year
    2004, we also announced several strategic partnerships with
    other major technology companies to address a variety of data
    management, information life cycle management (ILM), backup and
    recovery, and compliance/retention issues that are important to
    our enterprise customers. We also expanded our channel strategy
    by entering into distribution agreements with the North American
    Computer Products group of Arrow Electronics and Avnet Hall-Mark
    to expand our storage businesses and gain greater market
    penetration opportunities.

Critical Accounting Estimates and
Policies

Our discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations is based upon our
Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The preparation of these Consolidated
Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues, and expenses, and related disclosure. We evaluate, on
an ongoing basis, our estimates and judgments, including those
related to sales returns, bad debts, goodwill and intangibles,
income taxes, excess inventory and purchase commitments,
investments, intangible assets, lease losses and restructuring
accruals, stock-based compensation, and contingencies. We base
our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results
may differ from these estimates.

We believe the accounting policies described
below, are the ones that most frequently require us to make
estimates and judgments, and therefore are critical to the
understanding of our results of operations:

Revenue Recognition and
    Allowances

We apply the provisions of Statement of Position
(“SOP”) No. 97-2,

“Software Revenue
Recognition”

and related interpretations, to all
transactions that generate revenue. We recognize revenue when:

•

Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement
    Exists.

It is our customary practice
    to have a purchase order and/or contract prior to recognizing
    revenue on an arrangement from our end user customers, value
    added resellers, or distributors.

•

Delivery has
    Occurred.

Our product is physically
    delivered to our customers, generally with standard transfer
    terms such as FOB origin or EXWorks point of origin. We
    typically do not allow for re-stocking rights with any of our
    value-added resellers or distributors. Products shipped with
    acceptance criteria or return rights are not recognized as
    revenue until all criteria are achieved. If undelivered



products or services exist that are essential to
    the functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement,
    delivery is not considered to have occurred.

•

The Fee is Fixed or
    Determinable.

Arrangements with
    payment terms extending beyond our standard terms and condition
    practices are not considered to be fixed or determinable.
    Revenue from such arrangements is recognized as the fees become
    due and payable. We typically do not allow for price-protection
    rights with any of our value added resellers or distributors.

•

Collection is
    Probable.

Probability of collection is
    assessed on a customer-by-customer basis. Customers are subject
    to a credit review process that evaluates the customers’
    financial position and ultimately their ability to pay. If it is
    determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection is
    not probable based upon our review process, revenue is
    recognized upon cash receipt.

For arrangements with multiple elements, we
allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based
on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the
undelivered items. We defer the portion of the arrangement fee
equal to the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of
the undelivered elements until they are delivered. Vendor
specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price
charged when the element is sold separately.

A typical arrangement includes product, software
subscription, and maintenance. Some arrangements include
training and consulting. Software subscriptions include
unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a
when-and-if-available basis, bug fixes, and patch releases, and
are included in product revenues. Service maintenance includes
contracts for technical support and hardware maintenance.
Revenue from software subscriptions and service is recognized
ratably over the contractual term, generally one to three years.
Revenue from training and consulting is recognized as the
services are performed.

We record reductions to revenue for estimated
sales returns at the time of shipment. These estimates are based
on historical sales returns, changes in customer demand, and
other factors. If actual future returns and allowances differ
from past experience, additional allowances may be required.

We also maintain a separate allowance for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment
of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the
aging of the accounts receivable. We analyze accounts receivable
and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer
solvency, current economic and geographic trends, and changes in
customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the
adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. If the
financial condition of our customers deteriorates, resulting in
an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional
allowances may be required.

Valuation of Goodwill and
    Intangibles

We record intangible assets when we acquire
companies. The cost of the acquisition is allocated to the
assets and liabilities acquired, including identifiable
intangible assets, with the remaining amount being classified as
goodwill. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets include
existing workforce, existing technology, patents, trademarks,
customer contracts and covenants not to compete. Identifiable
intangible assets are amortized over time, while in-process
research and development is recorded as a charge on the date of
acquisition and goodwill is capitalized, subject to periodic
review for impairment. Accordingly, the allocation of the
acquisition cost to identifiable intangible assets has a
significant impact on our future operating results. The
allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and
assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows expected
to be generated by the acquired assets. Should conditions be
different than management’s current assessment, material
write-downs of the fair value of intangible assets may be
required. We periodically review the estimated remaining useful
lives of our other intangible assets. A reduction in the
estimate of remaining useful life could result in accelerated
amortization expense or a write-down in future periods. As such,
any future write-downs of these assets would adversely affect
our gross and operating margins.

We evaluate the impairment of goodwill and
purchased indefinite life intangible assets on an annual basis,
or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such
as adverse industry or economic



trends, restructuring actions, lower projections
of profitability, or a sustained decline in our market
capitalization. Evaluations of possible impairment and, if
applicable, adjustments to carrying values, require us to
estimate, among other factors, future cash flows, useful lives,
and fair market values of our reporting units and assets. Actual
results may vary from our expectations.

Under our accounting policy we will perform an
annual review in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more
often if indicators of impairment exist. Accordingly, goodwill
recorded in business combinations may significantly affect our
future operating results to the extent impaired, but the
magnitude and timing of any such impairment is uncertain. When
we conduct our annual evaluation of goodwill, as of
February 27, 2004, or if in the interim impairment
indicators are identified with respect to goodwill, the fair
value of goodwill is re-assessed using valuation techniques that
require significant management judgment. Should conditions be
different than management’s last assessment, significant
write-downs of goodwill may be required. In fiscal 2004 and
2003, we performed such evaluation and found no impairment.
Goodwill as of April 30, 2004 is $291.8 million, and
any future write-downs of goodwill would adversely affect our
operating margin. See Note 13 —

Goodwill and
Purchased Intangible Assets

to our consolidated financial
statements.

Accounting for Income Taxes

The determination of our tax provision is subject
to judgments and estimates due to operations in several tax
jurisdictions outside the U.S. Earnings derived from our
international business are generally taxed at rates that are
lower than U.S. rates, resulting in a reduction of our
effective tax rate. The ability to maintain our current
effective tax rate is contingent upon existing tax laws in both
the U.S. and in the respective countries in which our
international subsidiaries are located. Future changes in
domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued
realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving and
expect to receive from international business. In addition, a
decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from our
international business or in the mix of international business
among particular tax jurisdictions could increase our overall
effective tax rate. Also, our current effective tax rate assumes
that U.S. income taxes are not provided for undistributed
earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. These earnings
could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or
federal and state income taxes should they be either deemed or
actually remitted to the U.S. In fiscal 2004, we recorded a
non-recurring income tax benefit of $16.8 million
associated with a favorable foreign tax ruling, which occurred
during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. This favorable ruling
from the Netherlands provides for retroactive benefits dating
back to fiscal year 2001 as well as current and future tax rate
benefits. During fiscal 2004, we received tax refunds that
relate to prior years’ tax payments.

The carrying value of our net deferred tax
assets, which consists primarily of the reversal of net
deductible temporary differences including credits, and net
operating loss carryforwards, assumes that we will be able to
generate sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize these
tax attributes. If we do not generate sufficient future income,
the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired
resulting in additional income tax expense. We have provided a
valuation allowance on the deferred tax attributes associated
with the exercise of employee stock options (primarily credits
and net operating loss carryforwards) because of uncertainty
regarding their realizability due to the expectation of future
employee stock option exercises. If these attributes are
realized, the associated tax benefit will be credited to
stockholders’ equity, rather than as a reduction in the
income tax provision.

Inventory Write-downs

We write down inventory and record purchase
commitment liabilities for estimated excess and obsolete
inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory
and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future
demand and market conditions. Although we strive for accuracy in
our forecasts of future product demand, any significant
unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments
could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory
and commitments, and our reported results. If actual market
conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional
write-downs and other charges against earnings may be required.
If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may realize
higher gross margin in the period when the written-down
inventory is sold.



We engage in extensive product quality programs
and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the
quality of our component suppliers. We also provide for the
estimated cost of known product failures based on known quality
issues when they arise. Should actual cost of product failure
differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated liability
would be required.

Restructuring Accruals

In fiscal 2002, as a result of continuing
unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in IT spending
rates, we implemented two restructuring plans, which included
reductions in our workforce and a consolidation of our
facilities. These restructuring accruals were accounted for in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
Issue No. 94-3,

“Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)”

, and included various assumptions such
as the time period over which the facilities will be vacant,
expected sublease terms, and expected sublease rates. These
estimates are reviewed and revised periodically and may result
in a substantial change to restructuring expense should
different conditions prevail than were anticipated in original
management estimates. Future restructuring will be accounted for
under SFAS No. 146

“Accounting for Costs
associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,”

which
superceded EITF No. 94-3. See Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Impairment Losses on
    Investments

We perform periodic reviews of our investments
for impairment. As of April 30, 2004, our short-term
investments have been classified as
“available-for-sale” and are carried at fair value.
There have been no significant decline in fair value of
investments that are considered to be other-than-temporary under
the EITF No. 03-01, for any of the three years in the
period ended April 30, 2004. Our investments in publicly
held companies are generally considered impaired when a decline
in the fair value of an investment as measured by quoted market
prices is less than its carrying value, and such a decline is
not considered temporary. Our investments in privately held
companies are considered impaired when a review of the
investees’ operations and other indicators of impairment
indicate that the carrying value of the investment is not likely
to be recoverable. Such indicators include, but are not limited
to, limited capital resources, limited prospects of receiving
additional financing, and limited prospects for liquidity of the
related securities. In fiscal 2004, we recorded a gain of
$0.7 million related to sales of previously impaired
investments. During fiscal 2003, we recorded a non-cash
write-down of $2.0 million related to impairments of our
investments as their reduction in value was judged to be
other-than-temporary. During fiscal 2002, we recorded a
non-cash, other-than-temporary write-down of $13.0 million
related to the impairment of our investment in publicly traded
and nonpublicly-traded companies.

Accounting for Stock-based
    Compensation

We adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148 and
provided pro forma disclosure using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model to value our employee stock options. The fair
value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and is not subject
to revaluation as a result of subsequent stock price
fluctuations. The Black-Scholes option pricing model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, option pricing models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
volatility. We use projected volatility rates, which are based
upon historical volatility rates since our initial public
offering, trended into future years. Because our employee stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those
of traded options and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management’s opinion, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value
of our options.

Loss Contingencies

We are subject to the possibility of various loss
contingencies arising in the course of business. We consider the
likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the
incurrence of a liability as well as our ability



to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in
determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is
accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred
or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information
available to us to determine whether such accruals should be
adjusted.

New Accounting Standards

In December 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on
EITF No. 00-21,

“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables.”

This issue addresses certain aspects of
the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will
perform multiple revenue-generating activities. In some
arrangements, the different revenue-generating activities
(deliverables) are sufficiently separable and there exists
sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account
for some or all of the deliverables (that is, there are separate
units of accounting). In other arrangements, some or all of the
deliverables are not independently functional, or there is not
sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them
separately. This issue addresses when and, if so, how an
arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided
into separate units of accounting. This issue does not change
otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria. The guidance
in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into
in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The
adoption of this accounting standard did not have a significant
impact on our financial position and results of operations.

The FASB issued FIN No. 46,

“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,”

in January 2003, and a revised interpretation of FIN 46
(“FIN 46-R”) in December 2003. FIN 46
requires certain variable interest entities (“VIEs”)
to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if
the equity investors in the entity do not have the
characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not
have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support
from other parties. The provisions of FIN 46 are effective
immediately for all arrangements entered into after
January 31, 2003. Since January 31, 2003, the Company
has not invested in any entities it believes are variable
interest entities for which the Company is the primary
beneficiary. For all arrangements entered into after
January 31, 2003, the Company is required to continue to
apply FIN 46 through April 30, 2004. The Company is
required to adopt the provisions of FIN 46-R for those
arrangements on May 1, 2004. For arrangements entered into
prior to February 1, 2003, the Company is required to adopt
the provisions of FIN 46-R on May 1, 2004. The Company
does not expect the adoption of FIN 46-R to have an impact
on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows
of the Company.

In April 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 149,

“Amendment of
SFAS No. 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.”

SFAS No. 149 amends and
clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and
for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. In
particular, this Statement clarifies under what circumstances a
contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic
of a derivative. It also clarifies when a derivative contains a
financing component that warrants special reporting in the
statement of cash flows. SFAS No. 149 is generally
effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003. The adoption of this accounting standard did
not have a significant impact on our financial position, results
of operations and cash flow.

In May 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,

which requires that certain financial instruments be
presented as liabilities that were previously presented as
equity or as temporary equity. Such instruments include
mandatory redeemable preferred and common stock, and certain
options and warrants. SFAS No. 150 is effective for
financial instruments entered into or modified after
May 31, 2003 and was effective at the beginning of the
first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. In
November 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
(“FSP”) No. 150-3,

Effective Date,
Disclosures, and Transition for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial
Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain
Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests under
SFAS No. 150

, which defers the effective date for
various provisions of SFAS No. 150. As of
April 30, 2004, we had no financial instruments within the
scope of this pronouncement.

In November 2003, the EITF reached an interim
consensus on Issue 03-01,

“The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain
Investments,”

to require additional disclosure



requirements for securities classified as
available-for-sale or held-to-maturity for fiscal years ending
after December 15, 2003. Those additional disclosures have
been incorporated into the accompanying footnotes. In March
2004, the EITF reached a final consensus on this Issue, to
provide additional guidance which companies must follow in
determining whether investment securities have an impairment
which should be considered other-than-temporary. The guidance is
applicable for reporting periods after June 15, 2004. The
Company does not believe that adoption of the disclosure
requirements under the interim consensus would have had a
significant impact on the carrying value of its investments at
April 30, 2004. The Company will continue to monitor the
carrying value of its investments under this new guidance in
fiscal 2005.

Results of Operations

The following table sets forth certain
consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of total
revenues for the periods indicated:

Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003

Business
Combinations

— During the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we acquired Spinnaker for
approximately $305.6 million (including estimated
transaction costs) in an all-stock transaction, through the
merger of Nagano Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Network
Appliance, with and into Spinnaker (the



“Merger”), with Spinnaker to survive as
the wholly owned subsidiary of Network Appliance. Spinnaker
provides scalable system architectures, distributed file
systems, next-generation clustering technologies, and
virtualization. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase
transaction. The unaudited pro forma information giving pro
forma effect to the Merger is presented under
Note 11 — Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Product
Revenues

— Product revenues
increased by 31.9% to $1,058.2 million in fiscal 2004, from
$802.3 million in fiscal 2003. Product revenues growth was
across all geographies. This increase in product revenues was
specifically attributable to increased software licenses and
software subscriptions and an increase in units shipped, as
compared to the prior year.

Product revenues were favorably impacted by the
following factors:

Product revenues were negatively impacted by the
following factors:

•

lower-cost-per-megabyte disks; and

•

declining average selling price and unit sales of
    our older filer and caching products.

The acquisition of Spinnaker in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004 did not have a significant impact on
fiscal 2004 revenues. We cannot assure you that we will be able
to maintain or increase market demand for our products.

Service
Revenues

— Service revenues,
which include hardware support, professional services, and
educational services, increased by 24.9% to $112.1 million
in fiscal 2004, from $89.8 million in fiscal 2003. Service
revenues are generally deferred and, in most cases, recognized
ratably over the service obligation periods, which are typically
one to three years. Service revenues represented 9.6%, and 10.1%
of total revenues for fiscal year 2004, and 2003, respectively.
The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increasing number
of enterprise customers, which typically purchase more complete
and generally longer-term service packages. Higher service
revenues were also related to a growing installed base resulting
in new customer support contracts in addition to support
contract renewals by existing customers. While it is an element
of our strategy to expand and offer a more comprehensive, global
enterprise support and service solution, we cannot assure you
that service revenue will grow at the current rate in fiscal
2005.

International Total
Revenues

— International
total revenues (including U.S. exports) increased by 46.9%
in fiscal year 2004 compared fiscal 2003. International total
revenues were $551.0 million, or 47.1% of total revenues
for fiscal year 2004. The increase in international sales for
fiscal year 2004 was primarily a result of European and Asia/
Pacific net revenues growth, driven by larger storage
implementations, new products, and higher storage spending in
certain geographic regions, as compared to the prior fiscal
year. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or
increase international revenues in fiscal 2005.



Product Gross
Margin

— Product gross
margin decreased to 64.9% for fiscal 2004, from 65.1% for the
fiscal 2003. Amortization of existing technology included in
cost of product revenues was $3.7 million and
$5.5 million for fiscal year 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Estimated future amortization of existing technology to cost of
product revenues relating to the Spinnaker acquisition will be
$3.4 million for each of fiscal year 2005, 2006, 2007,
2008; $2.7 million for fiscal year 2009; and none
thereafter.

Product gross margin was negatively impacted by:

Product gross margin was favorably impacted by:

Service Gross
Margin

— Service gross
margin decreased to 15.9% in fiscal 2004 as compared to 26.5% in
fiscal 2003. Investments in global service increased by 43.0% to
$94.3 million in fiscal 2004, from $66.0 million in
fiscal 2003. The decrease in service gross margin was primarily
due to the continued investment in our service infrastructure to
support our increasing enterprise customer base partially offset
by improved headcount utilization. These investments included
additional professional support engineers, increased support
center activities and global service partnership programs.
Service gross margin will typically experience some variability
over time due to the timing of technical support service
initiations and renewals and additional investments in our
customer support infrastructure. We expect service margin to
improve as we begin to see service revenue growth and improved
headcount utilization, partially offset by major investments in
headcount and logistics as we continue to build out our service
capability and capacity.

Sales and
Marketing

— Sales and
marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions,
advertising and promotional expenses, and certain global service
and support costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased 14.9%
to $349.5 million for fiscal 2004, from $304.2 million
for fiscal 2003. These expenses were 29.9% and 34.2% of total
revenues for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. The
increase in absolute dollars was attributed to sales kick-off
and club meetings, increased commission expenses resulting from
increased revenues, an extra week of expenses in fiscal 2004
compared to fiscal 2003, the continued worldwide investment in
our sales and global service organizations associated with
selling complete enterprise solutions and scaling our sales
infrastructure, offset by cost controls, and reduction in
discretionary spending efforts. Amortization of Spinnaker
trademarks/tradenames and customer contracts/relationships
included in sales and marketing expenses was $0.2 million
for fiscal year 2004 and none in 2003, respectively. Estimated
future amortization of trademarks, tradenames, customer
contracts and relationships relating to the Spinnaker
acquisition will be $0.8 million and $0.3 million for
fiscal year 2005 and 2006, respectively, and none thereafter.

Sales and marketing headcount increased to 1,421
at April 30, 2004 from 1,199 at April 30, 2003. We
expect to continue to selectively add sales capacity in an
effort to expand domestic and international markets,



introduce new products, establish and expand new
distribution channels, and increase product and company
awareness. We expect to increase our sales and marketing
expenses commensurate with future revenue growth.

Research and
Development

— Research and
development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits,
prototype expenses, non-recurring engineering charges, fees paid
to outside consultants, and amortization of capitalized patents.
Included in research and development expenses are capitalized
patents amortization of $1.5 million for April 30,
2004, as compared to none for the same periods in the prior
year. Estimated future capitalized patents amortization expenses
will be $1.8 million for each of the fiscal years 2005,
2006, 2007, and 2008, and $0.3 million thereafter.

Research and development expenses increased 16.8%
to $131.9 million for fiscal 2004 from $112.9 million
for fiscal 2003. These expenses represented 11.3% and 12.7% of
total revenues for fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
increase in research and development expenses was primarily a
result of an extra week of expenses in fiscal 2004 compared to
fiscal 2003, increased ongoing operating impact of the Spinnaker
acquisition, increased headcount, ongoing support of current and
future product development and enhancement efforts, prototyping
expenses and non-recurring engineering charges offset by cost
controls, and reduction in discretionary spending efforts.
Research and development headcount increased to 650 as of
April 30, 2004, compared to 526 as of April 30, 2003.
For both fiscal 2004 and 2003, no software development costs
were capitalized.

We believe that our future performance will
depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our
current product line, develop new products that achieve market
acceptance, maintain technological competitiveness, and meet an
expanding range of customer requirements. We expect to
continuously support current and future product development and
enhancement efforts, and incur prototyping expenses and
non-recurring engineering charges associated with the
development of new products and technologies. We intend to
continuously broaden our existing product offerings and
introduce new products that expand our solutions portfolio.

We believe that our research and development
expenses will increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2005,
primarily due to ongoing costs associated with the development
of new products and technologies, projected headcount growth and
the operating impact of the Spinnaker acquisition.

General and
Administrative

— General and
administrative expenses increased 48.1% to $54.6 million in
fiscal 2004, from $36.8 million in fiscal 2003. These
expenses represented 4.7% and 4.1% of total revenues for fiscal
2004 and 2003, respectively. Increases in absolute dollars were
primarily due to expenses associated with initiatives to enhance
and implement our enterprise-wide ERP system, back office
infrastructure and expanded regulatory requirements, partially
offset by cost control and reduction in discretionary spending
efforts. General and administrative headcount increased to 331
in fiscal 2004 from 283 in fiscal 2003. We believe that our
general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute
dollars in fiscal 2005 due to expanded regulatory requirements.
Amortization of Spinnaker covenants not to compete included in
general and administrative expenses was $1.1 million for
fiscal 2004 and none in 2003, respectively. Estimated future
amortization of covenants not to compete relating to the
Spinnaker acquisition will be $5.1 million and
$1.5 million for fiscal year 2005 and 2006, respectively,
and none thereafter.

Stock
Compensation

— We account
for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions
of Accounting Principle Board Opinion (“APB”)
No. 25 (“APB No. 25”)

“Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees,”

and comply with the
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,”

as
amended by SFAS No. 148,

“Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
Disclosures.”

Deferred compensation recognized under
APB No. 25 is amortized to expense ratably over their
vesting periods. We account for stock options issued to
non-employees in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 123 and EITF No. 96-18

“Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to
Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with
Selling, Goods or Services”

under the fair value based
method.



Stock compensation expenses were
$3.9 million and $3.6 million for fiscal 2004 and
2003, respectively. This net increase in stock compensation
expenses reflected primarily higher stock compensation relating
to the Spinnaker acquisition and restricted stock awards offset
by forfeitures of unvested options assumed in the Spinnaker and
WebManage acquisitions. Estimated future deferred stock
compensation amortization expenses are $7.8 million,
$6.8 million, $5.1 million and $3.7 million in
fiscal 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, and none
thereafter.

Restructuring
Charges

— In fiscal 2002, as
a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a
reduction in IT spending rates, we implemented two restructuring
plans, which included reductions in our workforce and
consolidations of our facilities.

Fiscal 2002 Second Quarter Restructuring
Plan.

In August 2001, we implemented
the first restructuring plan, which included a reduction in
workforce by approximately 200 employees and a consolidation of
facilities. The action was required to properly align and manage
the business commensurate with our then current revenue levels.
All functional areas of the Company were affected by the
reduction. We completed our actions during the second quarter of
fiscal 2002. As a result of this restructuring, we incurred a
charge of $8.0 million. The restructuring charge included
$4.8 million of severance-related amounts,
$2.7 million of committed excess facilities and facility
closure expenses, and $0.5 million in fixed assets
write-offs. The reserve balance of $0.8 million at
April 30, 2004, was included in other accrued liabilities.

During fiscal 2002, we purchased our Sunnyvale
headquarters site and terminated the operating leases. As a
result, an adjustment was made to reduce the previously recorded
estimated facilities lease losses by $1.5 million. During
fiscal 2002 and 2003 we recorded net restructuring adjustments
of $0.1 million and $(0.3) million, respectively, due
to changes in the estimated costs of certain actions and final
resolution of certain restructuring activities. In the event
that the foreign facilities that we vacated are not subleased,
we will be obligated for additional total lease payments of
approximately $0.4 million as of April 30, 2004 to be
payable through January 2006.

As of April 30, 2004, we have
$0.7 million outstanding in our accrued and unpaid
severance-related restructuring costs due to changes in
estimated costs of certain severance-related matters. We expect
to pay or adjust the remaining severance-related restructuring
costs pending the outcome of the ultimate resolution of these
matters in the next twelve months.

The following analysis sets forth the significant
components of the second quarter fiscal 2002 restructuring at
April 30, 2004 (in thousands):

Fiscal 2002 Fourth Quarter Restructuring
Plan.

In April 2002, we completed a
restructuring related to the closure of an engineering facility
and consolidation of resources to the Sunnyvale headquarters. As
a result of this restructuring, we recorded a charge of
$5.9 million. The restructuring charge included
$0.8 million of severance-related amounts,
$4.6 million of committed excess facilities and facility
closure expenses, and $0.5 million in fixed assets
write-offs. Of the reserve balance at April 30, 2004,
$0.7 million was included in other accrued liabilities and
the remaining $4.5 million was classified as long-term
obligations.

In fiscal 2003 and 2004, we updated our
assumptions and estimates based on certain triggering events,
which resulted in additional net charges of $0.9 million
and $1.3 million, respectively, primarily relating to



sublease assumptions for our engineering
facility. Our estimates are reviewed and revised periodically
and may result in a substantial charge to restructuring expense
should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in
previous management estimates. Such estimates included various
assumptions such as the time period over which the facilities
will be vacant, expected sublease terms, and expected sublease
rates. In the event that the engineering facility is not
subleased as anticipated, we will be obligated for an additional
total lease payments of $1.8 million as of April 30,
2004 to be payable through November 2010.

The following analysis sets forth the significant
components of the fourth quarter fiscal 2002 restructuring at
April 30, 2004 (in thousands):

Interest Income —

During fiscal 2004, interest income
was $13.7 million, as compared to $12.2 million in
fiscal 2003. The increase in interest income was primarily
driven by higher cash and investment balances provided by
operating activities partially offset by lower average interest
rates on our investment portfolio. We expect interest income to
increase for fiscal 2005 as a result of higher cash and invested
balances in a higher interest-rate portfolio environment as we
reinvest our securities in longer-term investments.

Other Expenses, Net —

Other expenses, net, included a net
exchange loss from foreign currency transactions of
$2.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively, for
fiscal 2004 and 2003. The increase in net exchange loss was
attributed to the impact of currency balance sheet hedging
activities resulting from forecast variances.

Net Gain (Loss) on Investments —

Our investments in publicly held
companies are generally considered impaired when a decline in
the fair value of an investment as measured by quoted market
prices is less than its carrying value, and such a decline is
not considered temporary. In fiscal 2004, we realized a net gain
of $0.7 million on the sale of previously impaired
investments. In fiscal 2003, we recorded a non-cash write down
of $2.0 million related to the impairment of our
investments, partially offset by a gain of $0.8 million on
previously impaired investments.

Gain on Sale of Intangible Assets —

We recorded a gain on sale of
intangible assets of $0.6 million in fiscal 2003 related to
the sale of our ContentReporter software. We intend to resell
this software through a licensing arrangement.

Provision Benefit for Income Taxes —

Provision for income taxes for fiscal
2004 included a nonrecurring income tax benefit of
$16.8 million or approximately $0.05 per share
associated with a favorable foreign tax ruling, which occurred
during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. This favorable ruling
from the Netherlands provides for retroactive benefits dating
back to fiscal year 2001 as well as current and future tax rate
benefits. This Dutch tax ruling, however, will expire at the end
of calendar 2005. There are uncertainties associated with
securing a new Dutch tax ruling. As such, we cannot assure you
that we will be able to extend this ruling or secure any new
favorable rulings, the absence of which may have an adverse
impact on our international operations.

For fiscal 2004, we had an effective tax rate of
10.8% which included 9.9% reduction to account for the
$16.8 million non-recurring benefit from the foreign tax
ruling. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 differed from the
U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the retroactive and
current benefits of the foreign tax ruling, the



availability of tax credits, and the generation
of foreign earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. For fiscal 2003,
our effective tax rate was 21.8%, which included certain
benefits from tax credits and foreign earnings in a lower tax
jurisdiction.

Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002

Product
Revenues

— Product revenues
increased by 9.9% to $802.3 million in fiscal 2003, from
$729.9 million in fiscal 2002. Product revenue growth
occurred across all geographies. This increase in product
revenues was specifically attributable to increased software
licenses and software subscriptions and an increase in units
shipped, as compared to the prior year.

Our revenue growth was primarily driven by new
product innovation as we continue to enhance and extend our
full-line enterprise portfolio, providing customers with a lower
overall cost of ownership. We expanded both our customer base
and strategic partnerships with enterprise infrastructure
providers and gained market acceptance for our new and expanded
unified storage, NearStore and NetCache products. We believe our
competitive advantage is a result of lower total cost of
ownership from a combination of four factors: lower acquisition
cost, reduced administrative overhead, minimized service cost,
and reduced downtime of critical business applications.

Product revenues were favorably impacted by the
following factors:

Product revenues were negatively impacted by the
following factors:

Service
Revenues

— Service revenues,
which include hardware support, professional services, and
educational services, increased by 31.2% to $89.8 million
in fiscal 2003, from $68.5 million in fiscal 2002. Service
revenues are generally deferred and, in most cases, recognized
ratably over the service period



obligations, which are typically one to three
years. The increase in service revenues (representing 10.1% and
8.6% of total revenues for fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively)
was due to an increasing number of enterprise customers, which
typically purchase more complete service packages. Higher
service revenues was also related to a growing installed base
resulting in new customer support contracts in addition to
support contract renewals by existing customers.

International Total
Revenues

— International
total revenues (including U.S. exports) increased by 11.9%
for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. International total
revenues were $375.2 million, or 42.1% of total revenues
for fiscal 2003. The increase in international sales for fiscal
2003 was primarily a result of European and Asia/ Pacific net
revenues growth, driven by larger storage implementations and
new products, and positive foreign exchange effects from a weak
U.S. dollar, as compared to the prior year.

Product Gross
Margin

— Product gross
margin increased to 65.1% of product revenues for fiscal 2003 as
compared to 63.3% in fiscal 2002. Amortization of existing
technology included in cost of product revenue was $5.5 and
$5.7 million, respectively, for fiscal 2003 and 2002.

Product gross margin was favorably impacted by:

Product gross margin was negatively impacted by:

Service Gross
Margin

— Service gross
margin increased to 26.5% for fiscal 2003 compared to 18.2% for
fiscal 2002. Investments in global service increased by 17.8% to
$66.0 million in fiscal 2003 from $56.0 million in
fiscal 2002. The improvement in service gross margin in fiscal
2003 was primarily due to operational and cost efficiencies in
the global service organizations, combined with the ramping up
of our service infrastructure in fiscal 2002 in anticipation of
service revenue growth.

Sales and
Marketing

— Sales and
marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions,
advertising and promotional expenses, and certain global service
and support costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased 7.0%
to $304.2 million for fiscal 2003, from $284.4 million
for fiscal 2002. These expenses were 34.2% and 35.6% of total
revenues for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, respectively. The
increase was attributed to the continued worldwide investment in
our sales and global service organizations associated with
selling complete solutions at the enterprise level, marketing
and various advertising programs, and expenses associated with
our growing mix of enterprise customers and associated global
account programs. Sales and marketing headcount decreased to
1,199 in fiscal 2003, from 1,224 in fiscal 2002.

Research and
Development

— Research and
development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits,
prototype expenses, non-recurring engineering charges, and fees
paid to outside consultants. Research and development expenses
decreased 3.3% to $112.9 million in fiscal 2003, from
$116.7 million in fiscal 2002. These expenses represented
12.7% and 14.6% of total revenues for fiscal 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Research and development expenses decreased in
absolute dollars, primarily as a result of cost controls,
reduction in discretionary spending efforts, and the impact of
fiscal 2002 restructuring activities. Research and development
headcount increased to 526 in fiscal 2003 from 514 in fiscal
2002. We expect to continuously support



current and future product development and
enhancement efforts, and incur prototyping expenses and
nonrecurring engineering charges associated with the development
of new products and technologies. For both fiscal 2003 and 2002,
no software development costs were capitalized.

General and
Administrative

— General and
administrative expenses decreased 8.4% to $36.8 million in
fiscal 2003, from $40.2 million in fiscal 2002. These
expenses represented 4.1% and 5.1% of total revenues for fiscal
2003 and 2002, respectively. Decreases in absolute dollars were
primarily due to cost control, reduction in discretionary
spending efforts, the successful collection of previously
accrued customer-specific bad debt allowances, partially offset
by expenses associated with initiatives to enhance and implement
an enterprise-wide ERP system. General and administrative
headcount increased to 283 in fiscal 2003 from 246 in fiscal
2002.

Stock
Compensation

— We account
for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance
with the provisions of APB No. 25,

“Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees,”

and comply with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123,

“Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,”

for non-employee
compensation awards. Accordingly, we recognize the intrinsic
value for employees and the fair value for non-employees as
stock compensation expense over the vesting terms of the awards.
Stock compensation expenses were $3.6 million and
$7.2 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. This
decrease was primarily due to $2.2 million of lower
deferred stock compensation amortization in fiscal 2003 compared
to fiscal 2002 attributed to forfeitures of unvested options
assumed in the WebManage acquisition; a decrease of
$2.1 million of stock compensation as 165,310 contingently
issuable milestone shares relating to Orca Systems, Inc.
(“Orca”) valued at $3.0 million were released in
fiscal 2002 as compared to the release of 99,186 shares
valued at $0.9 million in fiscal 2003; offset by an
increase of $0.7 million relating to the fair value of
options granted to a member of the Board of Directors.

Restructuring
Charges

— In fiscal 2002, as
a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a
reduction in IT spending rates, we implemented two restructuring
plans, which included reductions in workforce and a
consolidation of facilities.

Fiscal 2002 Second Quarter Restructuring
Plan.

In August 2001, we implemented
the first restructuring plan, which included a reduction in
workforce by approximately 200 employees and a consolidation of
facilities. The action was required to properly align and manage
the business commensurate with our then current revenue levels.
All functional areas of the Company were affected by the
reduction. We completed our actions during the second quarter of
fiscal 2002. As a result of this restructuring, we incurred a
charge of $8.0 million. The restructuring charge included
$4.8 million of severance-related amounts,
$2.7 million of committed excess facilities and facility
closure expenses, and $0.5 million in fixed assets
write-offs. The reserve balance of $0.8 million at
April 30, 2003 was included in other accrued liabilities.

During fiscal 2002, we purchased our Sunnyvale
headquarters site and terminated the operating leases. As a
result, an adjustment was made to reduce the previously recorded
estimated facilities lease losses by $1.5 million. During
fiscal 2003, we recorded a net restructuring adjustment of
$0.3 million due to changes in the estimated costs of
certain actions and final resolution of certain restructuring
activities. In the event that the foreign facilities are not
subleased, we will be obligated for additional total lease
payments of approximately $0.7 million as of April 30,
2003, to be payable through January 2006.



The following analysis sets forth the significant
components of the restructuring reserve at April 30, 2003,
and April 30, 2002 (in thousands):

Fiscal 2002 Fourth Quarter Restructuring
Plan.

In April 2002, we announced and
substantially completed a restructuring related to the closure
of an engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the
Sunnyvale headquarters, which included a headcount reduction of
34 employees. As a result of this restructuring, we incurred a
charge of $5.9 million. The restructuring charge included
$0.8 million of severance-related amounts,
$4.6 million of committed excess facilities and facility
closure expenses, and $0.5 million in fixed assets
write-off. Of the reserve balance at April 30, 2003,
$1.5 million was included in other accrued liabilities and
the remaining $3.1 million was classified as long-term
obligations.

In January 2003, we updated our assumptions and
estimates based on certain triggering events, which resulted in
an additional net charge of $0.9 million, primarily
relating to our engineering facility lease. Our estimates are
reviewed and revised periodically and may result in a
substantial charge to restructuring expense should different
conditions prevail than were anticipated in original management
estimates. Such estimates included various assumptions such as
the time period over which the facilities will be vacant,
expected sublease terms, and expected sublease rates. In the
event that the engineering facility is not subleased, we will be
obligated for additional total lease payments of
$3.4 million as of April 30, 2003, to be payable
through November 2010.

The following analysis sets forth the significant
components of the restructuring reserve at April 30, 2003
and 2002 (in thousands):

Of the reserve balance at April 30, 2003,
$1.5 million was included in other accrued liabilities and
the remaining $3.1 million was classified as long-term
obligations.



Interest
Income

— During fiscal 2003,
interest income was $12.2 million, as compared to
$18.5 million in fiscal 2002. The decrease in interest
income was primarily due to lower average interest rates,
partially offset by higher investment balances provided by
operating activities.

Other Expenses,
Net

— Other expenses, net,
included a net exchange loss from foreign currency transactions
of $1.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, for
fiscal 2003 and 2002.

Net Loss on
Investments

— Our
investments in publicly held companies are generally considered
impaired when a decline in the fair value of an investment as
measured by quoted market prices is less than its carrying
value, and such a decline is not considered temporary. In fiscal
2003, we recorded a non-cash, other-than-temporary write-down of
$2.0 million related to the impairment of our investment in
our publicly traded and private companies partially offset by a
gain of $0.8 million on previously impaired investments. In
fiscal 2002, we recorded a non-cash, other-than-temporary
write-down of $13.0 million related to impairments of our
investments in publicly traded and private companies. During
fiscal 2003, we sold shares of certain privately held
investments and realized a net loss of $0.5 million. During
fiscal 2002, we sold shares of certain marketable investments
and the realized gain was not material.

Gain on Sale of Intangible
Assets

— We recorded a gain
on sale of intangible assets of $0.6 million in fiscal 2003
related to the sale of our ContentReporter software. We intend
to resell this software through a licensing arrangement.

Provision (Benefit) for Income
Taxes

— For fiscal 2003, our
effective tax rate was 21.8%. The effective tax rate for fiscal
2003 differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to
credits, and foreign earnings in a lower tax jurisdiction. For
fiscal 2002, we applied an annual benefit rate of 19.7% to
pretax loss. Our effective tax rate is based on existing tax
laws and distributions of income/(loss) among different entities
and tax jurisdictions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of April 30, 2004, as compared to the
April 30, 2003 balances, our cash, cash equivalents, and
short-term investments increased by $189.1 million to
$808.0 million. We derive our liquidity and capital
resources primarily from our cash flow from operations and from
working capital. Working capital increased by
$156.5 million to $745.0 million as of April 30,
2004, compared to $588.5 million as of April 30, 2003.

In addition to higher net income in fiscal 2004,
the primary factors that impacted the period-to-period change in
cash flows relating to operating activities included the
following that improved cash flow for the year:

•

Increase in deferred revenues from higher
    software subscription and service billings attributable to our
    continuing shift toward larger enterprise customers;

•

Increased accrued compensation and related
    benefits due to higher commission and other profit dependent
    payroll-related accruals resulting from higher revenue and
    profitability;

•

Increased income taxes payable, primarily
    reflecting higher profitability in fiscal 2004 as compared to
    fiscal 2003; tax refunds associated with the favorable tax
    ruling from the Netherlands, partially offset by worldwide tax
    payments.

The above factors were partially offset by the
effects of:

•

Increased accounts receivable balances due to
    higher revenues;

•

Increased prepaid expenses primarily due to
    prepayment of a license fee of $13.0 million;

•

Increased deferred income taxes primarily due to
    book versus tax timing differences and additional net deferred
    tax assets relative to Spinnaker’s net operating losses and
    research and development credits;

We used $48.6 million and $61.3 million
of cash in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively, for
capital expenditures. We used net proceeds of
$235.1 million and $90.0 million in fiscal 2004 and
fiscal 2003, respectively, for net purchases/redemptions of
short-term investments. In June 2003, we acquired additional



patents for a purchase price of approximately
$9.0 million. Investing activities in fiscal 2004 and
fiscal 2003 also included new investments in privately held
companies of $0.9 million and $0.7 million,
respectively. We received $1.1 million and
$0.8 million in sales proceeds from sales of previously
impaired investments in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003,
respectively. In February 2004, we incurred $8.0 million on
a bridge loan and related transaction costs and assumed
$1.2 million cash relating to the Spinnaker acquisition.

We used $54.6 million in fiscal 2004 and
received $29.2 million in fiscal 2003 from net financing
activities, which included sales of common stock related to
employee stock transactions net of common stock repurchases. We
repurchased 6.9 million shares of common stock at a total
of $136.2 million during fiscal 2004. Other financing
activities provided $81.5 million and $29.2 million in
fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively, which related to
sales of common stock related to employee stock transactions.
The change in cash flow from financing was primarily due to the
effects of the common stock repurchases partially offset by
higher proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee
programs compared to the same period in the prior year.

On May 18, 2004, we announced that the Board
authorized an expansion of our stock repurchase program to
purchase up to $200.0 million of outstanding common stock
in the open market. Any repurchases under our stock repurchase
program may be made from time to time in the open market subject
to market conditions. The stock repurchase program may be
suspended or discontinued at any time. The stock repurchases
will be funded from available working capital.

We expect to receive a tax refund of
approximately $9.0 million in connection with a carryback
of net operating losses generated in fiscal 2000. These losses
are being carried back into tax years fiscal 1996, 1997, 1998,
and 1999. We have been advised that the Congressional Joint
Committee on Taxation has completed its consideration and has
taken no exception to the conclusions reached by the Internal
Revenue Service regarding these carrybacks.

Our capital and liquidity requirements depend on
numerous factors, including risks relating to fluctuating
operating results, continued growth in the network storage and
content delivery markets, customer and market acceptance of our
products, dependence on new products, rapid technological
change, dependence on qualified technical and sales personnel,
risk inherent in our international operations, competition,
reliance on a limited number of suppliers and contract
manufacturers, relationships with strategic partners and
resellers, dependence on proprietary technology, intellectual
property rights, the value of our investments in equity
securities and real estate, and other factors. We believe that
our existing liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to
fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.

Contractual Cash Obligations and Other
    Commercial Commitments

The following summarizes our contractual cash
obligations and commercial commitments at April 30, 2004,
and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our
liquidity and cash flow in future periods, (in thousands):

For purposes of the above table, contractual
obligations for the purchase of goods and services are defined
as agreements that are enforceable, legally binding on us, and
subject us to penalties if we cancel the agreement.



Guarantees

As of April 30, 2004, our notional fair
values of foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option
contracts totaled $161.0 million. We do not believe that
these derivatives present significant credit risks, because the
counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial
institutions, and we manage the notional amount of contracts
entered into with any one counterparty. We do not enter into
derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading
purposes. Other than the risk associated with the financial
condition of the counterparties, our maximum exposure related to
foreign currency forward and option contracts is limited to the
premiums paid.

We offer both recourse and non-recourse lease
financing arrangements to our customers. Under the terms of
recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we
remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments
to the third-party leasing company in the event that any
customers were to default. We defer 100% of the recourse lease
obligation and recognize revenue over the term of the lease as
the lease payments become due. As of April 30, 2004 and
2003, the maximum recourse exposure under such leases totaled
approximately $6.8 million and $4.9 million,
respectively. Under the terms of the non-recourse leases we do
not have any continuing obligations or liabilities. To date, we
have not experienced significant losses under this lease
financing program.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to
fluctuations in interest rates, market prices and foreign
currency exchange rates. We use certain derivative financial
instruments to manage these risks. We do not use derivative
financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All
financial instruments are used in accordance with
management-approved policies.

Market Interest and Interest Income
Risk

Interest and Investment
Income

— As of
April 30, 2004, we had short-term investments of
$566.8 million. Our investment portfolio primarily consists
of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the
date of purchase of greater than three months, which are
classified as available-for-sale, and investment in marketable
equity securities in primarily technology companies. These
highly liquid investments, consisting primarily of government,
municipal and corporate debt securities, are subject to interest
rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if
market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 10% increase in
market interest rates from levels at April 30, 2004, would
cause the fair value of these short-term investments to decline
by approximately $1.1 million. Because we have the ability
to hold these investments until maturity we would not expect any
significant decline in value of our investments caused by market
interest rate changes. Declines in interest rates over time
will, however, reduce our interest income. We do not use
derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.

Market Price Risk

Equity
Securities

— We are also
exposed to market price risk on our equity securities included
in our short-term investments, which are primarily in publicly
traded companies in the volatile technology industry sector. In
fiscal 2003, we recorded a non-cash, other-than-temporary
write-down of $0.7 million related to the impairment of our
investment in a publicly traded company

We do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our
market exposure from these securities and, as a result, the
amount of income and cash flow that we ultimately realize from
our investment in future periods may vary materially from the
current fair value. A 50% adverse change in the equity price
would result in an immaterial decrease in the fair value of our
equity security as of April 30, 2004.

The hypothetical changes and assumptions
discussed above may be different from what actually occurs in
the future. Furthermore, such computations do not anticipate
actions that may be taken by management, should the hypothetical
market changes actually occur over time. As a result, the effect
on actual earnings in the future may differ from those described
above.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk and
Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts

We hedge risks associated with foreign currency
transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in
foreign currency exchange rates on earnings. We utilize forward
and option contracts to hedge against the short-term impact of
foreign currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies. All balance sheet hedges are
marked to market through earnings every period. We also use
foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency
forecasted transactions related to certain sales and operating
expenses. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges
under SFAS No. 133. For cash flow hedges, the gains or
losses were included in other comprehensive income at
April 30, 2004.

We do not enter into foreign exchange contracts
for speculative or trading purposes. In entering into forward
and option foreign exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk
that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties
to meet the terms of their contracts. We attempt to limit our
exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts
with credit worthy multinational commercial banks. All contracts
have a maturity of less than one year.

our foreign exchange forward contracts and currency options
contracts outstanding on April 30, 2004 (in thousands):

Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders of

Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal
Year

— We operate on a
52-week or 53-week year ending on the last Friday in April. For
presentation purposes we have indicated in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements that our fiscal year end is
April 30. Fiscal 2004 was a 53-week fiscal year. Fiscal
2003 and 2002 were 52-week fiscal years.

Basis of
Presentation

— The
consolidated financial statements include the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Risk and
Uncertainties

— There are no
concentrations of business transacted with a particular customer
nor concentrations of sales from a particular market or
geographic area that would severely impact our business in the
near term. However, we currently rely on a limited number of
suppliers for certain key components and several key contract
manufacturers to manufacture most of our products, any
disruption or termination of these arrangements could materially
adversely impact our operating results.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

— We consider
all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Short-Term
Investments

—
Available-for-sale investments with original maturities of
greater than three months are classified as short-term
investments, as these investments generally consist of highly
marketable securities that are intended to be available to meet
current cash requirements. All of our investments are classified
as available-for-sale, which are carried at fair market value,
and unrealized gains or losses recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss), which is a separate component of
stockholders’ equity, net of taxes. Any gains or losses on
sales of investments are computed based upon specific
identification. For all periods presented, realized gains and
losses on available-for-sale investments were not material.
Management determines the appropriate classification of debt and
equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the
classification at each reporting date. Available-for-sale
investments are reviewed for evidence of reductions in market
value that are other-than-temporary. We perform periodic reviews
of our investments for impairment. Our investments in publicly
held companies are generally considered impaired when a decline
in the fair value of an investment as measured by quoted market
prices is less than its carrying value and such a decline is not
considered temporary. We comply with the provisions of
EITF 03-01 requiring new disclosures for
other-than-temporary impairments on debt and equity investments,
see Note 3. During fiscal 2003, we recorded a non-cash,
other-than-temporary write-down of $726, related to impairment
of our investments in publicly traded companies. During fiscal
2002, we recorded a non-cash, other-than-temporary write-down of
$13.0 million related to the impairment of our investment
in publicly traded and nonpublicly-traded companies. These
write-downs are included in net gain (loss) on investments on
the income statement. No other-than-temporary write-downs were
recorded during fiscal 2004.

Investments in Nonpublic
Companies

— We have certain
investments in nonpublicly-traded companies in which we have
less than 20% of the voting rights and in which we do not
exercise significant influence and accordingly, we account for
these investments under the cost method. As of April 30,
2004 and 2003, $1,593 and $909 of these investments are included
in other long-term assets on the balance sheet and are carried
at cost. We perform periodic reviews of our investments for
impairment. Our investments in nonpublicly-traded companies are
considered impaired when a review of the investees’
operations and other indicators of



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

impairment indicate that the carrying value of
the investment is not likely to be recoverable. Such indicators
include, but are not limited to, limited capital resources,
limited prospects of receiving additional financing, and limited
prospects for liquidity of the related securities. During fiscal
2003, we recorded a non-cash, other-than-temporary write-down of
$1,300 related to impairments of our investments in
nonpublicly-traded companies which are included in net gain
(loss) on investments on the income statement. No write-downs
were recorded during fiscal 2004.

Inventories

—
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out
basis) or market. Cost components include materials, labor and
manufacturing overhead costs. We write down inventory and record
purchase commitment liabilities for excess and obsolete
inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory
and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future
demand and market conditions.

Property and
Equipment

— Property and
equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, which generally range from three to five years. The land
at the Sunnyvale headquarters site acquired in April 2002 is not
being depreciated. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the
remaining term of the lease. Building improvements are amortized
over the estimated lives of the assets, which generally range
from ten to forty years. Construction in progress will be
amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective
assets when they are ready for their intended use.

We review the carrying values of long-lived
assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net
book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected
future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition. The
amount of impairment loss, if any, is measured as the difference
between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the
asset.

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible
Assets

— Goodwill and
identifiable intangibles are accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 141

“Business Combinations”

and SFAS No. 142

“Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets”.

We recorded goodwill, existing
workforce and identifiable intangibles related to the
acquisitions of Orca, WebManage and Spinnaker and evaluate these
items for impairment on an annual basis, or sooner if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values may not
be recoverable. If an evaluation is required, the estimated
future undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets
would be compared to their carrying amount to determine if a
write-down to fair market value or discounted cash flow value is
required. We performed an annual impairment test of goodwill on
February 27, 2004 and February 21, 2003, respectively,
and found no impairment. For business combinations consummated
before July 1, 2001, goodwill and existing workforce were
amortized through April 30, 2002 using the straight-line
method over an estimated useful life of three to five years. See
Note 11.

Purchased intangible assets include patents,
trademarks, tradenames, customer contracts/relationships and
covenants not to compete, which are carried at cost less
accumulated amortization. Useful lives generally range from
18 months to five years. See Note 13 —

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets.

Revenue Recognition and
Allowance

— We apply the
provisions of Statement of Position (“SOP”)
No. 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,”

and related interpretations to all revenue transactions. We
recognize revenue when:

•

Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement
    Exists.

It is our customary practice
    to have a purchase order and/or contract prior to recognizing
    revenue on an arrangement from our end user, customers, value
    added resellers, or distributors.

•

Delivery has
    Occurred.

Our product is physically
    delivered to our customers, generally with standard transfer
    terms such as FOB origin or EXWorks point of origin. We
    typically do not allow for re-stocking rights with any of our
    value-added resellers or distributors. Products shipped with
    acceptance criteria or return rights are not recognized as
    revenue until all criteria are achieved. If undelivered



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

products or services exist that are essential to
    the functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement,
    delivery is not considered to have occurred.

•

The Fee is Fixed or
    Determinable.

Arrangements with
    payment terms extending beyond our standard terms and condition
    practices are not considered to be fixed or determinable.
    Revenue from such arrangements is recognized as the fees become
    due and payable. We typically do not allow for price-protection
    rights with any of our value-added resellers or distributors.

•

Collection is
    Probable.

Probability of collection is
    assessed on a customer-by-customer basis. Customers are
    subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the
    customers’ financial position and ultimately their ability
    to pay. If it is determined from the outset of an arrangement
    that collection is not probable based upon our review process,
    revenue is recognized upon cash receipt.

For arrangements with multiple elements, we
allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based
on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the
undelivered items. We defer the portion of the arrangement fee
equal to the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of
the undelivered elements until they are delivered. Vendor
specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price
charged when the element is sold separately.

A typical arrangement includes product, software
subscription, and maintenance. Some arrangements include
training and consulting. Software subscriptions include
unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a
when-and-if-available basis, bug fixes, and patch releases, and
are included in product revenues. Service maintenance includes
contracts for technical support and hardware maintenance.
Revenue from software subscriptions and service is recognized
ratably over the contractual term, generally one to three years.
Revenue from training and consulting is recognized as the
services are performed.

The following table presents the components of
revenues, stated as a percentage of total revenues:

We record reductions to revenue for estimated
sales returns at the time of shipment. These estimates are based
on historical sales returns, changes in customer demand, and
other factors. If actual future returns and allowances differ
from past experience, additional allowances may be required.

We also maintain a separate allowance for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment
of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the
aging of our accounts receivable. We analyze accounts receivable
and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer
solvency, current economic and geographic trends, and changes in
customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the
adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. If the
financial condition of our customers deteriorates, resulting in
an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional
allowances may be required.

Software Development
Costs

— The costs for the
development of new software products and substantial
enhancements to existing software products are expensed as
incurred until technological feasibility has been established,
at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in
accordance with SFAS No. 86,

“Accounting for
the Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
Marketed.”

Because we believe our



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

current process for developing software is
essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of
technological feasibility, which occurs upon the completion of a
working model, no costs have been capitalized for any of the
periods presented. In accordance with SOP No. 98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed
or Obtained for Internal Use,”

the cost of
internally-developed software is capitalized and included in
property and equipment at the point at which the conceptual
formulation, design and testing of possible software project
alternatives have been completed and management authorizes and
commits to funding the project. Pilot projects and projects
where expected future economic benefits are less than probable
are not capitalized. Internally-developed software costs include
the cost of software tools and licenses used in the development
of our systems, as well as consulting costs. Completed projects
are transferred to property and equipment at cost and are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives, generally three years.

Income
Taxes

— Deferred income tax
assets and liabilities are provided for temporary differences
that will result in future tax deductions or income in future
periods, as well as the future benefit of tax credit
carryforwards. A valuation allowance reduces tax assets to their
estimated realizable value. U.S. income taxes are not
provided on that portion of unremitted earnings of foreign
subsidiaries expected to be reinvested indefinitely.

Foreign Currency
Translation

— For
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency,
gains and losses resulting from translation of these foreign
currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are
recorded within stockholders’ equity as part of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries where the
functional currency is the U.S. dollar, gains and losses
resulting from the process of remeasuring foreign currency
financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in
other income (expenses), net.

In fiscal 2002, we determined that the functional
currency of one of our subsidiaries had changed from the Euro to
the U.S. Dollar. Accordingly, all monetary assets and
liabilities were translated at the current exchange rate in
effect as of the balance sheet date, nonmonetary assets and
liabilities were translated at historical rates, and total
revenues and expenses were translated at average exchange rates
in effect during the period. Transaction gains and losses are
included in other income (expenses), net in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income.

Derivative
Instruments

— We adopted
SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”

as amended by
SFAS No. 149,

“Amendment of
SFAS No. 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.”

Derivatives that are not designated as
hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings. If the
derivative is designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of
the exposure being hedged, changes in fair value will either be
offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset or
liability through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive
income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The
ineffective portion of the hedge is recognized in earnings
immediately.

As a result of our significant international
operations, we are subject to risks associated with fluctuating
exchange rates. We use derivative financial instruments,
principally currency forward contracts and currency options, to
attempt to minimize the impact of exchange rate movements on our
balance sheet relating to certain foreign currency assets and
liabilities and operating results. We have established
transaction and balance sheet risk management programs to
protect against reductions in fair value and volatility of
future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. Factors
that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging
program include the accuracy of forecasts and the volatility of
foreign currency markets. These programs reduce, but do not
always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange
movements. The maturities of these instruments are generally
less than one year.



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Currently, we do not enter into any foreign
exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures related to firm
commitments or equity investments. Our major foreign currency
exchange exposures and related hedging programs are described
below:

Use of
Estimates

— The preparation
of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America requires management to establish
accounting policies which contain estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Concentration of Credit
Risk

— Financial instruments
which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk
consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments,
and accounts receivable. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments consist primarily of U.S. government agencies,
corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, cash accounts held at
various banks, and money market funds held at several financial
institutions. We sell our products primarily to large
organizations in different industries and geographies. Credit
risk is mitigated by our credit evaluation process and limited
payment terms. We do not require collateral or other security to
support accounts receivable. In addition, we maintain an
allowance for potential credit losses. In entering into forward
foreign exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might
arise



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

from the possible inability of counterparties to
meet the terms of their contracts. The counterparties to these
contracts are major multinational commercial banks, and we do
not expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults.

Comprehensive
Income

— Comprehensive
income is defined as the change in equity during a period from
non-owner sources. Comprehensive income for the years ending
April 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002 has been disclosed within
the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity and
comprehensive income (loss).

The components of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) net of related tax effects at April 30, were
as follows:

Net Income per
Share

— Basic net income per
share is computed by dividing income available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for that period. Diluted net income per share is
computed giving effect to all dilutive potential shares that
were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common
shares consist of incremental common shares subject to
repurchase, common shares issuable upon exercise of stock
options and restricted stock awards.

The following is a reconciliation of the
numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income
per share computations for the periods presented:

At April 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002, 19,794,
44,582, and 30,991 shares of common stock options with a
weighted average exercise price of $47.16, $30.98, and $40.17
respectively, were excluded from the diluted net income per
share computation, as their exercise prices were greater than
the average market price of the common shares for the periods
presented and would therefore be antidilutive.

Stock-Based
Compensation

— We account
for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions
of APB No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,”

and comply with the disclosure provisions
of SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosures.”

Deferred compensation
recognized under APB No. 25 is amortized ratably to expense
over the vesting periods. We account for stock options issued to
non-employees in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 123 and EITF No. 96-18

“Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to
Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with
Selling, Goods or Services”

under the fair value based
method.

We adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
SFAS No. 123, and accordingly, no expense has been
recognized for options granted to employees under the various
option plans described under Note 6. We amortize deferred
stock-based compensation ratably over the vesting periods of the
applicable stock purchase rights, restricted stocks and stock
options, generally four years. Deferred stock compensation under
APB No. 25 and pro forma net income (loss) under the
provisions of SFAS No. 123 are adjusted to reflect
cancellations and forfeitures due to employee terminations as
they occur. Had compensation expense been determined based on
the fair value at the grant date for awards, consistent with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, our pro forma net income
(loss) and pro forma net income (loss) per share would be as
follows (in thousands, except per share data):

The fair value of each option grant is estimated
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model, and is not subject to revaluation as a result of
subsequent stock price fluctuations. The following
weighted-average assumptions are used:

The Black-Scholes option pricing model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, option pricing models require



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the input of highly subjective assumptions,
including the expected stock price volatility. We use projected
volatility rates, which are based upon historical volatility
rates since our initial public offering, trended into future
years. Because our employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options and because
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion,
the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of our options.

Statements of Cash Flows —

Supplemental cash flow and non-cash
investing and financing activities are as follows:

Recently Issued Accounting
Standards —

In December
2002, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF No. 00-21,

“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.”

This issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a
vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple
revenue-generating activities. In some arrangements, the
different revenue-generating activities (deliverables) are
sufficiently separable and there exists sufficient evidence of
their fair values to separately account for some or all of the
deliverables (that is, there are separate units of accounting).
In other arrangements, some or all of the deliverables are not
independently functional, or there is not sufficient evidence of
their fair values to account for them separately. This issue
addresses when and, if so, how an arrangement involving multiple
deliverables should be divided into separate units of
accounting. This issue does not change otherwise applicable
revenue recognition criteria. The guidance in this issue is
effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of this
accounting standard did not have a significant impact on our
financial position and results of operations.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Interpretation No. 46
(“FIN 46”),

“Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities,

” in January 2003, and a revised
interpretation of FIN No. 46 (“FIN 46-R”) in
December 2003. FIN No. 46 requires certain variable
interest entities (“VIEs”) to be consolidated by the
primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the
entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling
financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for
the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support from other parties. The
provisions of FIN No. 46 are effective immediately for all
arrangements entered into after January 31, 2003. Since
January 31, 2003, the Company has not invested in any
entities it believes are variable interest entities for which
the Company is the primary beneficiary. For all arrangements
entered into after January 31, 2003, the Company is
required to continue to apply FIN No. 46 through
April 30, 2004. The Company is required to adopt the
provisions of FIN No. 46-R for those arrangements on
May 1, 2004. For arrangements entered into prior to
February 1, 2003, the Company is required to adopt the
provisions of FIN No. 46-R on May 1, 2004. The



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Company does not expect the adoption of FIN
No. 46-R to have an impact on the financial position,
results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

In April 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 149,

“Amendment of
SFAS No. 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.”

SFAS No. 149 amends and
clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and
for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. In
particular, this Statement clarifies under what circumstances a
contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic
of a derivative. It also clarifies when a derivative contains a
financing component that warrants special reporting in the
statement of cash flows. SFAS No. 149 is generally
effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003. The adoption of this accounting standard did
not have a significant impact on our financial position, results
of operations and cash flow.

In May 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity,

which requires that certain financial instruments be
presented as liabilities that were previously presented as
equity or as temporary equity. Such instruments include
mandatory redeemable preferred and common stock, and certain
options and warrants. SFAS No. 150 is effective for
financial instruments entered into or modified after
May 31, 2003 and was effective at the beginning of the
first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. In
November 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
(“FSP”) No. 150-3,

Effective Date,
Disclosures, and Transition for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial
Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain
Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests under
SFAS No. 150

, which defers the effective date for
various provisions of SFAS No. 150. As of
April 30, 2004, we had no financial instruments within the
scope of this pronouncement.

In November 2003, the EITF reached an interim
consensus on Issue 03-01,

“The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain
Investments,

” to require additional disclosure
requirements for securities classified as available-for-sale or
held-to-maturity for fiscal years ending after December 15,
2003. Those additional disclosures have been incorporated into
the accompanying footnotes. In March 2004, the EITF reached a
final consensus on this Issue, to provide additional guidance
which companies must follow in determining whether investment
securities have an impairment which should be considered
other-than-temporary. The guidance is applicable for reporting
periods after June 15, 2004. The Company does not believe
that adoption of the disclosure requirements under the interim
consensus would have had a significant impact on the carrying
value of its investments at April 30, 2004. The Company
will continue to monitor the carrying value of its investments
under this new guidance in fiscal 2005.

In May 2000, we entered into a split dollar
insurance arrangement with Daniel J. Warmenhoven. Under the
arrangement, we will pay the annual premiums on several
insurance policies on the life of the survivor of
Mr. Warmenhoven and his wife Charmaine Warmenhoven, and
Mr. Warmenhoven will pay us each year for a portion of
those premiums equal to the economic value of the term insurance
coverage provided him under the policies. For each of the 2001,
2002, 2003 and 2004 fiscal years, we paid an aggregate net
annual premium on these split dollar polices in the amount of
approximately $2,050. In April 2004, we paid $1,860 annual
premium on these policies for fiscal year 2005. Under the
arrangement, we will be reimbursed for all premium payments made
on those policies, and it is intended that we will be reimbursed
not later than May 2005. The policies are owned by a family
trust established by Mr. Warmenhoven, and upon the death of
the survivor of Mr. Warmenhoven and his wife or any earlier
cash-out of the policies, we will be entitled to a portion of
the insurance proceeds or cash surrender value of the policies
equal to the net amount of cumulative premiums paid on those
policies by us, and the balance will be paid to the trust. We
have obtained a collateral assignment of the policies as a
security interest for our portion of the proceeds or cash
surrender value payable to us under the policies, and neither
Mr. Warmenhoven nor the trust may borrow against the
policies while that security interest remains in effect. The
arrangement is terminable by us upon thirty (30)-days prior
notice, and such termination will trigger a refund of the net
cumulative premiums paid by us on the policies.

From time to time, we have committed to purchase
various key components used in the manufacture of our products.
We establish accruals for estimated losses on purchased
components for which we believe it is

our commitments and associated accruals may change.

We are subject to various legal proceedings and
claims which may arise in the normal course of business. While
the outcome of these legal matters is currently not
determinable, we do not believe that any current litigation or
claims will have a material adverse effect on our business, cash
flow, operating results, or financial condition.

Line of Credit

In July 1998, we negotiated a $5,000 unsecured
revolving credit facility with a domestic commercial bank. Under
terms of the credit facility, which expires in December 2004, we
must maintain various financial covenants. Any borrowings under
this agreement bear interest at either LIBOR plus 1% or at the
lender’s “prime” lending rate, such rate
determined at our discretion. As of April 30, 2004, the
amounts drawn under the various letters of credit amounted to
$1,602 relating primarily to workers’ compensation and a
foreign lease.

We also have foreign exchange facilities used for
hedging arrangements with several banks that allow us to enter
into foreign exchange contracts of up to $185,000, of which
$24,024 was available at April 30, 2004.

Stockholders’ Equity

Preferred
Stock

— Our Board of
Directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000 shares of
preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences,
privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, of those
shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders.

Stock Option
Plans

— In September 1995,
we adopted the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan (the “1995
Plan”). All outstanding options issued under a previous
option plan were incorporated into the 1995 Plan upon the
effectiveness of our initial public offering.

Under the 1995 Plan, the Board of Directors may
grant to employees, directors and consultants options to
purchase shares of our common stock. The 1995 Plan is comprised
of three separate equity incentive programs: (i) the
Discretionary Option Program under which options may be granted
to eligible individuals at a fixed price per share;
(ii) the Salary Investment Option Grant Program under which
the company’s officers and other highly-compensated
employees may elect to have a portion of their base salary
reduced in return for stock options and (iii) the Stock
Issuance Program under which eligible persons may be issued
shares of Common Stock directly. Options granted under the 1995
Plan generally vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of
the vesting commencement date and then ratably over the
following 36 months. Options expire as determined by the
Board of Directors, but not more than ten years after the date
of grant.

In April 1997, the Board of Directors adopted the
Special Non-officer Stock Option Plan (the “Non-officer
Plan”) which provides for the grant of options and the
issuance of common stock under terms substantially the same as
those provided under the 1995 Plan, except that the Non-officer
Plan allows only for the issuance of nonqualified options to
non-officer employees.

In August 1999, the Board of Directors adopted
the 1999 Stock Option Plan (the “1999 Plan”), which is
comprised of three separate equity incentive programs:
(i) the Discretionary Option Grant Program under which
options may be granted to eligible individuals during the
service period at a fixed price per share, (ii) the Stock
Issuance Program under which eligible individuals may be issued
shares of Common Stock directly; and (iii) the Automatic
Option Grant Program under which nonemployee board members will
automatically receive option grants at designated intervals over
their period of board service.

The 1999 Plan supplements the existing 1995 Plan
and Non-officer Plan and those plans will continue to remain in
full force and effect until all available shares have been
issued under each such plan. However, an



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Automatic Option Grant Program previously in
effect under the 1995 Plan terminated as of October 26,
1999, and all automatic option grants made to nonemployee board
members on or after that date will be made under the 1999 Plan.

Under the 1999 Plan, the Board of Directors may
grant to employees, directors and consultants and other
independent advisors options to purchase shares of our common
stock during their period of service with us. The exercise price
for an incentive stock option and a nonstatutory option cannot
be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock
on the grant date. Options granted under the 1999 Plan generally
vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting
commencement date and then ratably over the following
36 months. Options will have a term of ten years after the
date of grant, subject to earlier termination upon the
occurrence of certain events. In fiscal 2003, the 1999 Plan was
amended to increase the share reserve by an additional
14,000 shares of common stock and effect certain changes to
the Automatic Option Grant Program in effect for the nonemployee
members of the Board of Directors. In fiscal 2004, the 1999 Plan
was amended to create the Stock Issuance Program, whereby
eligible individuals may be issued shares of common stock
directly, either through the issuance or immediate purchase of
these shares or as a bonus for services rendered.

Options granted under the 1999 Plan are subject
to the cancellation/regrant program with the following
limitations: (i) only options held by employees who are
neither executive officers nor members of the board can be
repriced; and (ii) the total number of repriced options
will not exceed 10% of the total number of shares of common
stock authorized for issuance under the 1999 Plan. There have
been no repricings to date under any of the Plans.

In fiscal 2001, we assumed various stock option
plans in connection with our Orca and WebManage acquisitions.
Pursuant to the provisions of the merger agreements, outstanding
shares were exchanged under certain exchange ratios in effect at
the time of each merger. Options granted under these plans
generally vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the
vesting commencement date and then ratably over the following
36 months. Options expire as determined by the Board of
Directors, but not more than ten years after the date of grant.

In fiscal 2003, we reached a final settlement of
the escrow fund arrangement under the WebManage acquisition
agreement. We have determined the total amount of our losses
under the settlement arrangement and 11 restricted shares were
released from the escrow and delivered to Network Appliance,
valued in the aggregate at $1,210 based on the fair market value
of our common stock as of the date of the acquisition.
Accordingly, an adjustment was made to the cost of the WebManage
acquisition. The balance of the escrow shares has been
distributed to former shareholders of WebManage in proportion to
their share ownership in WebManage, as provided in the original
merger agreement.

In fiscal 2004, under terms of the Spinnaker
merger agreement we acquired Spinnaker for 12,377 shares of
common stock and assumed options to purchase 2,942 shares
of common stock in connection with the Spinnaker 2000 Stock
Plan. Outstanding options and restricted stock units were
exchanged pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. The
options and restricted stock units granted under this plan
generally vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the
vesting commencement date and then ratably over the following
36 months. The options expire not more than ten years from
the date of grant.

Additional information regarding options
outstanding as of April 30, 2004 is as follows:

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

— Under the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), employees are entitled
to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the fair market
value at certain specified dates. In fiscal 2004, the plan was
amended to increase the share reserve by an additional
1,000 shares of common stock. Of the 14,600 shares
authorized to be issued under this plan, 4,671 shares were
available for issuance at April 30, 2004, 1,486, 1,414, and
1,094 shares were issued in fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively, at a weighted average price of $10.62, $10.74, and
$14.60 respectively.

Stock Repurchase
Program

— On May 13,
2003, we announced that the Board of Directors approved a
$150,000 stock repurchase program to purchase shares of our
outstanding common stock in the open market.

During fiscal 2004, we repurchased
6,853 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of
$136,172. The repurchases were recorded as treasury stock and
resulted in a reduction of stockholders’ equity. On
May 18, 2004, we announced that the Board authorized an
expansion of the program to purchase an additional $200,000 of
outstanding common stock. Total authorized stock purchase
spending may be up to $350,000. The stock repurchase program may
be suspended or discontinued at any time. The duration of the
repurchase program is open-ended. Under the program, Network
Appliance, Inc. may purchase shares of common stock through open
market transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management.
The timing and amount of repurchase transactions under this
program will depend on market conditions and corporate and
regulatory considerations. The purchases will be funded from
available working capital.

Deferred Stock
Compensation

— Deferred
stock compensation is recorded for the grant of stock awards or
shares of restricted stock to employees at exercise prices
deemed to be less than the fair value of our common stock on the
grant date. Deferred stock compensation is also recorded for
retention escrow shares withheld in accordance with the merger
agreement. See Note 11. Deferred stock compensation is
adjusted to reflect cancellations and forfeitures due to
employee terminations as they occur. We recorded $28,617,
$1,171, and $1,301 of deferred stock compensation in fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, primarily related to the
recognition of stock compensation of unvested options assumed
and retention escrow shares withheld in the Spinnaker
acquisition totaling $25,892, restricted stock awards to certain
employees and the grant of stock options below fair value to
certain highly compensated employees. We reversed $3,235, $1,612
and $5,381 of



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

deferred compensation in fiscal 2004, 2003, and
2002, respectively, due to employee terminations. The reversals
were primarily related to the forfeiture of unvested options
assumed in the WebManage and Spinnaker acquisitions as a result
of employee terminations.

Under terms of the 1995 Plan, highly compensated
employees as defined by our management are eligible to
contribute between $15 and $75 in annual salary for the rights
to be granted nonqualified stock options. The exercise price
discount from fair market value, which is equal to the amount of
salary contributed, has been recorded as deferred stock
compensation expense. The deferred stock compensation expense is
amortized ratably over a one-year period. Additionally, under
the 1995 Stock Issuance Program, certain eligible persons may be
issued shares of common stock directly. During fiscal 2004,
120 shares of restricted stock awards are issued to certain
employees. The exercise price discount from fair market value of
these shares has been recorded as deferred stock compensation
expense, which was being amortized ratably over its respective
vesting periods, between three to four years.

Under terms of the acquisition agreement with
Orca, we released shares of common stock to former Orca
shareholders upon Orca’s meeting certain performance
criteria. The fair market values of these shares were measured
on the date the performance criteria were met and were
recognized as stock compensation. During fiscal 2003 and 2002,
we released an additional 99 and 165 shares of common
stock, respectively, valued in the aggregate at $921 and $3,015,
respectively. There are no additional performance milestones
remaining.

We recorded $498 and $748 in compensation expense
in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively, for the fair value of
options granted to a member of the Board of Directors in
recognition for services performed outside of the normal
capacity of a board member. The 100 common shares under the 1999
Plan were granted at an exercise price of $15.72 per share,
the fair market value per share on the grant date. The option
has a term of 10 years measured from the grant date,
subject to earlier termination following his cessation of board
service, and will vest in a series of 48 successive equal
monthly installments upon his completion of each month of board
service over the 48 month period measured from the grant
date.

We recorded $3,397, $1,973 and $4,187 in
compensation expense for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, primarily related to the amortization of deferred
stock compensation from unvested options assumed in the
WebManage and Spinnaker acquisitions, the retention escrow
shares relative to Spinnaker, the grant of stock options to
certain highly compensated employees below fair value at the
date of grant and the award of restricted stock to certain
employees. Estimated future deferred stock compensation
amortization for fiscal 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 are expected
to be $7,768, $6,753, $5,142 and $3,685, respectively, and none
thereafter.

The income tax benefit associated with
dispositions from employee stock transactions of $49,535,
$18,458 and $4,952, respectively, for fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002, were recognized as additional paid-in capital.

The components of our deferred tax assets and
liabilities are as follows:

Current net deferred tax assets are $24,163 and
$27,444 as of fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Non-current
net deferred tax assets for fiscal 2004 and 2003 are $73,631 and
$40,631, respectively, and are included in other assets within
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

During fiscal 2004, our Netherlands subsidiary
received a favorable tax ruling from the Dutch tax authorities.
The ruling is retroactive to May 1, 2000 and will expire on
December 31, 2005. During fiscal 2004, we received
substantial refunds of prior years’ tax payments that
relate to the retroactive application of this ruling. The ruling
resulted in a $16,831 benefit which was reported in the second
quarter of fiscal 2004.

As of April 30, 2004, the federal and state
net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were
approximately $730,908 and $198,646, respectively. The federal
net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal
2011 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin
to expire in fiscal 2006. As of April 30, 2004, we had
federal and state credit carryforwards of approximately $38,032
and $35,117, respectively, available to offset future taxable
income. The federal and state credit carryforwards will begin to
expire in fiscal 2008.

During fiscal 2004, as part of our acquisition of
Spinnaker, we acquired approximately $52,000 and $12,000 of
federal and state net operating losses, respectively, and $2,600
of federal credits that were realized as deferred tax assets
upon acquisition. While these attributes are subject to
limitation under IRC § 382, given certain available
built-in gains within Spinnaker, it is expected that utilization
of these deferred tax assets will occur. We also established a
valuation reserve of $2,400 against a portion of the state net
operating loss carryforwards of Spinnaker. If utilized, these
attributes will be treated as a reduction in acquired goodwill.



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We have provided a valuation allowance on certain
of our deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and
credit carryforwards attributable to the exercise of employee
stock options because of uncertainty regarding their
realizability of approximately $304,968 and $336,037 at the end
of fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. If recognized, the tax
benefit of these credits and losses will be accounted for as a
credit to stockholders’ equity rather than as a reduction
of the income tax provision. During fiscal 2004, we utilized
approximately $31,069 of this previously recorded valuation
allowance with a corresponding increase to shareholders’
equity.

We have not provided for U.S. federal income
and foreign withholding taxes on the investment basis
differential of our foreign subsidiaries that are not expected
to reverse in the foreseeable future and are expected to be
essentially permanent in duration of approximately $198,000.

Segment, Geographic and Customer
    Information

Under SFAS No. 131,

“Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information,”

we operate in one reportable industry
segment: the design, manufacturing, marketing and technical
support of high-performance networked storage solutions. We
market our products in the United States and in foreign
countries through our sales personnel and our subsidiaries. The
Chief Executive Officer is our Chief Operating Decision Maker
(“CODM”), as defined by SFAS No. 131. The
CODM evaluates resource allocation decisions and operational
performance based upon revenue by geographic regions. Under
SFAS No. 131, we have one reportable segment as all
the geographic operating segments identified can be aggregated
into one reportable segment. For the years ended April 30,
2004, 2003 and 2002, we recorded revenue from customers
throughout the U.S. and Canada; Europe; Latin America, Australia
and Asia Pacific.

The following presents total revenues for the
years ended April 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002 by geographic
area and long-lived assets as of April 30, 2004 and 2003 by
geographic area.

Total revenues above are attributed to regions
based on customers’ shipment locations.

International sales include export sales
primarily to the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, France, the
Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada and Australia. No single
foreign country accounted for 10% or more of total revenues in
fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002.

No customer accounted for 10% or more of total
revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003, or 2002.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments and restricted cash reported in the
consolidated balance sheets approximate their carrying value.
The fair value of short-term investments and foreign exchange
contracts are carried at fair value is based on quoted market
prices. Other investments in



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

equity securities included in other assets
comprise investments in companies in the volatile
high-technology market and their carrying value of $1,593 at
April 30, 2004 and $909 at April 30, 2003 approximates
their fair values.

We do not use derivative financial instruments
for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into forward
foreign exchange and currency option contracts to hedge trade
and intercompany receivables and payables as well as future
sales and operating expenses against future movement in foreign
exchange rates.

The forward foreign exchange contracts require us
to exchange foreign currencies for U.S. dollars or vice
versa and generally mature in less than one year. Option
contracts give us the option whether to exchange such
currencies, which we would do only when they are economically
beneficial. As of April 30, 2004, we had $160,875 of
outstanding foreign exchange contracts (including $8,178 of
option contracts) in Australian Dollars, British Pounds,
Canadian Dollars, Danish Krone, European Currency Units, South
African Rand and Swiss Francs, that all had remaining maturities
of four months or less. As of April 30, 2003, we had
$117,468 of outstanding foreign exchange contracts in Australian
Dollars, British Pounds, Swiss Francs, Canadian Dollars and
European Currency Units, that all had remaining maturities of
five months or less. For the balance sheet hedges, these
contracts are adjusted to fair value at the end of each month
and are included in earnings. The premiums paid on the foreign
currency option contracts are recognized as a reduction to other
income when the contract is entered into. For the cash flow
hedges, the related gains or losses are included in other
comprehensive income. Gains and losses on these foreign exchange
contracts are offset by losses and gains on the underlying
assets and liabilities. At April 30, 2004 and 2003, the
estimated notional fair values of forward foreign exchange
contracts were $160,976 and $117,516, respectively. Unrealized
gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts were not
significant at April 30, 2003. The fair value of foreign
exchange contracts is based on prevailing financial market
information. Other than foreign exchange contracts, we have not
entered into any other material financial derivative instruments.

Employee Benefit Plan

We have established a 401(k) tax-deferred savings
plan (“Savings Plan”). Employees meeting the
eligibility requirements, as defined, may contribute specified
percentages of their salaries. We contributed $1,326, $1,315 and
$1,235 for fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively to the
Savings Plan.

11.

Business Combination

On February 18, 2004, we acquired Spinnaker
for approximately $305,523 (including estimated transaction
costs of $2,985) in an all stock transaction, through the merger
of Nagano Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Network
Appliance, with and into Spinnaker (the “Merger”).

Spinnaker provides scalable system architectures,
distributed file systems, next-generation clustering
technologies, and virtualization. The combination of NetApp
unified storage and data management solutions with advanced
distributed storage technologies acquired from Spinnaker will
further our strategy to deliver Storage Grid solutions as the
foundation for data infrastructures of the future. In the near
term, the Spinnaker acquisition will allow us to target markets
with customers who are already deploying such grid like
architecture with large-scale Linux farms for high performance
computing applications in industry markets such as Energy,
Entertainment and Federal Government.

The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase
transaction. Under terms of the merger agreement, we acquired
Spinnaker for 12,377 shares of common stock and assumed
options to purchase 2,942 shares of common stock
pursuant to the Spinnaker 2000 Stock Plan. Of the
2,942 Spinnaker options assumed, 1,721 options were
granted on the acquisition date. We also advanced $5,000 as a
bridge loan, incurred certain transaction costs of $2,985 and
assumed certain operating assets and liabilities. There was no
contingent consideration provision under the terms of the
Spinnaker merger agreement.



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In accordance with the merger agreement,
1,229 indemnity escrow shares (the number of merger shares
multiplied by 10%) were withheld in escrow relative to the
Spinnaker acquisition. The indemnity escrow indemnifies any
claims in connection with the breach of any warranty,
representation, covenant or agreement pursuant to the merger
agreement. These shares held in escrow pending resolution of
representation and warranty provisions are included in the
purchase price consideration. Such representation and warranty
provisions lapse within eighteen months following the close date.

In accordance with the merger agreement,
362 retention escrow shares (the number of shares issued to
certain core employees shares multiplied by 20%) were withheld
in escrow relative to the Spinnaker acquisition. The 20% core
employees retention shares are subject to continued employment
and restriction. We accounted for the core employees escrow in
accordance with EITF No. 95-8

“Accounting for
Contingent Consideration Paid to Shareholders of an Acquired
Enterprise in a Purchase Business Combination,”

and
recorded the intrinsic value of the retention escrow shares as
deferred stock compensation and not additional purchase price.
Such deferred stock compensation of $8,550 will be amortized
over the expected service period, 25% on the first anniversary
of the closing date and 25% on the second anniversary and 50% on
the third anniversary.

The purchase price of the transaction was
allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their
estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition,
including identifiable intangible assets, with the remaining
amount being classified as goodwill. The allocation presented
here is preliminary and is subject to change as additional
information is received. Any adjustments to these amounts will
be accounted for as a change to goodwill.

Approximately $4,940 was allocated to acquired
in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) and
charged to operations because the acquired technology had not
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses.
The value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the
acquired IPR&D into commercially viable products, estimating
the resulting after-tax net cash flows (“free cash
flow”) from such projects, and discounting the free cash
flows back to their present value. The discount rate included a
factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the
successful development of the acquired IPR&D. These
estimates are subject to change, given the uncertainties of the
development process, and no assurance can be given that
deviations from these estimates will not occur. Following the
acquisition, costs incurred prior to establishment of
technological feasibility are charged to research and
development expense. Such costs have not been material through
April 30, 2004 and are not expected to be material in
fiscal 2005.

The total purchase prices and allocation among
the fair value of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities
acquired in the Spinnaker transaction (including purchased
in-process technology) are summarized as follows

(in
thousands):

In accordance with FASB interpretation
No. 44,

“Accounting for Certain Transactions
involving Stock Compensation,”

we recorded the
intrinsic value, measured as the difference between the grant
price and fair market value on the acquisition consummation
date, of unvested options, restricted stock and core employees
retention escrow shares assumed in the Spinnaker acquisition as
deferred stock compensation. Such deferred stock compensation,
which aggregated to $25,892 is recorded in a separate component
of stockholders’ equity in the accompanying condensed
consolidated balance sheet and is being amortized over the
vesting term of the related options and restricted stock/shares.

In November 2000, we completed the acquisition of
WebManage, a Chelmsford, Massachusetts-based software developer
of content management, distribution, and analysis solutions.
WebManage develops software that intelligently distributes
content between various points on the Internet and enables
organizations to plan, manage and deliver Internet/intranet
services. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase
transaction. Under terms of the agreement, we acquired WebManage
for $59,371 comprised of common stock, assumed options, and
cash. We also had an obligation to provide shares of common
stock to be valued at $3,000 if WebManage achieved certain
performance criteria. WebManage met these performance criteria
in March 2001 and as such, the contingent consideration was
recorded as stock compensation in the fourth quarter of 2001. We
also paid certain transaction costs and assumed certain
operating assets and liabilities. In fiscal 2003, we reached a
final settlement of the escrow arrangement under the WebManage
acquisition agreement. We have determined the total amount of
our losses under the settlement arrangement and 11 restricted
shares were released from the escrow and delivered to Network
Appliance, valued in the aggregate at $1,210 based on the fair
market value of our common stock as of the date of the
acquisition. Accordingly, an adjustment was made to the cost of
the WebManage acquisition. The balance of the escrow shares has
been distributed to former shareholders of WebManage in
proportion to their share ownership in WebManage, as provided in
the original merger agreement.

In June 2000, we completed the acquisition of
Orca, a Waltham, Massachusetts-based developer of high
performance Virtual Interface (VI) Architecture software for
enterprise-class UNIX and Windows systems. The acquisition
was accounted for as a purchase transaction. Under terms of the
agreement, we acquired Orca for $50,037 comprised of common
stock, assumed options and cash, with an obligation to provide
up to 264 shares of common stock, which resulted in
additional stock compensation charges relative to milestones
achievement. Orca met certain performance criteria and as such,
we issued and recorded during fiscal 2003 and 2002 an additional
99 and 165 shares of common stock. The fair market value of
such shares of $921 and



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$3,015, respectively, was measured on the date
Orca met the performance criteria and was recognized as stock
compensation in fiscal 2003 and 2002. There are no additional
performance milestones remaining. We also paid certain
transaction costs and assumed certain operating assets and
liabilities.

The operating results of Spinnaker have been
included in the condensed consolidated statements of income
since its acquisition date. The following unaudited pro forma
consolidated amounts give effect to this acquisition as if it
had occurred on May 1, 2003 and May 1, 2002,
respectively, by consolidating the results of operations of
Spinnaker with our results for the years ended April 30,
2004 and 2003.

The pro-forma results of operations give effect
to certain adjustments, including amortization of purchased
intangibles, stock compensation, contingently issuable shares,
common stock, assumed options and restricted stocks/shares in
connection with the acquisitions. In addition, a benefit for
taxes was recorded to reflect the impact of the pro forma
adjustments and assumed utilization of Spinnaker’s net
operating losses by Network Appliance using the federal and
state tax rates. The $4,940 charge for purchased in-process
research and development from Spinnaker has been excluded from
the pro-forma results, as it is a material nonrecurring charge.

The pro forma basic earnings per share is based
on (1) the historical weighted average number of shares of
Network Appliance outstanding, plus (2) approximately
12.4 million newly issued Network Appliance shares issued
to former stockholders of Spinnaker upon the consummation of the
transaction. The basic calculation gives effect to shares issued
as if the transaction took place at the beginning of the periods
presented.

The pro forma diluted earnings per share was
based on the pro forma basic earnings calculations for each of
Network Appliance and Spinnaker adjusted for the dilutive common
stock equivalents outstanding during the period using the
treasury stock method. The dilution for the options and
restricted stock assumed from Spinnaker was calculated using the
treasury method and was based on the number of stock options and
the exercise price assumed by Network Appliance and adjusted by
the option exchange ratio of 0.1471 for Spinnaker option and
restricted stock holders. In addition, the remaining unearned
deferred compensation recorded as a result of the Spinnaker
acquisition was considered as proceeds for the purposes of the
treasury stock method, which resulted in a lower number of
dilutive share equivalents. The pro forma basic and diluted
earnings per share are not indicative of future earnings per
share results.

Restructuring Charges

Fiscal 2002 Second Quarter Restructuring
    Plan

In August 2001, we implemented a restructuring
plan, which included a reduction in workforce by approximately
200 employees and a consolidation of facilities. The action was
required to properly align and manage the business commensurate
with our then current revenue levels. All functional areas of
the Company were affected by the reduction. We completed our
actions during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result of
this restructuring, we incurred a charge of $7,980. The
restructuring charge included $4,796 of severance-related
amounts, $2,656 of committed excess facilities and facility
closure expenses, and $528 in fixed assets write-offs. The
reserve balance of $848 at April 30, 2004 is included in
other accrued liabilities.

During fiscal 2002, we purchased our Sunnyvale
headquarters site and terminated the operating leases. As a
result, an adjustment was made to reduce the previously recorded
estimated facilities lease losses by $1,509. During fiscal 2003
and 2002, we recorded a net restructuring adjustment of $(334)
and $95 due to changes in the estimated costs of certain actions
and final resolution of certain restructuring activities. In the
event that the foreign facilities are not subleased, we will be
obligated for additional total lease payments of approximately
$432 as of April 30, 2004 to be payable through January
2006.

The following analysis sets forth the significant
components of the restructuring reserve at April 30, 2004,
2003 and 2002:

Fiscal 2002 Fourth Quarter Restructuring
    Plan

In April 2002, we announced and substantially
completed a restructuring related to the closure of an
engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the
Sunnyvale headquarters, which included a headcount reduction of
34 employees. As a result of this restructuring, we incurred a
charge of $5,850. The restructuring charge included $813 of
severance-related amounts, $4,564 of committed excess facilities
and facility closure expenses, and $473 in fixed assets
write-off.

In fiscal 2003 and 2004, we updated our
assumptions and estimates based on certain triggering events,
which resulted in an additional net charge of $923 and $1,327,
primarily relating to sublease assumptions for our engineering
facility. Our restructuring estimates are reviewed and revised
periodically and may result in a substantial charge to
restructuring expense, should different conditions prevail than
were anticipated in previous management estimates. Such
estimates included various assumptions such as the time period
over

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

which the facilities will be vacant, expected
sublease terms, and expected sublease rates. In the event that
the engineering facility is not subleased as anticipated, we
will be obligated for additional total lease payments of $1,761
as of April 30, 2004 to be payable through November 2010.

The following analysis sets forth the significant
components of the restructuring reserve at April 30, 2004,
2003 and 2002:

Of the reserve balances at April 30, 2004
and 2003, $667 and $1,485, respectively, were included in other
accrued liabilities and the remaining $4,541 and $3,086,
respectively, were classified as long-term obligations.

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible
    Assets

We adopted SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”

effective May 1, 2002. Upon adoption of
SFAS No. 142, we discontinued the amortization of our
recorded goodwill and assembled workforce of $49,422 as of that
date, identified our reporting units based on our current
segment reporting structure and allocated all recorded goodwill,
as well as other assets and liabilities, to the reporting units.
We concluded that our reporting units are the same as our
operating segments. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill
attributable to each of our reporting units is required to be
tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each
reporting unit with its carrying value. As of May 1, 2002,
this evaluation indicated that the fair value for each of our
reporting units exceeded the reporting unit’s carrying
amount and no impairment was recognized. On an ongoing basis,
goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment (or more frequently
if indicators of impairment arise). As of April 30, 2004
and 2003, respectively, there had been no impairment of goodwill
and intangible assets.

In connection with the adoption of
SFAS No. 142, we also reassessed the useful lives and
the classification of our purchased intangible assets and
determined that they continued to be appropriate except for
acquired workforce, net of deferred tax liabilities of $502,
which was reclassified into goodwill.

In fiscal 2003, we reached a final settlement of
the escrow arrangement under the WebManage acquisition
agreement. We have determined the total amount of our losses
under the settlement arrangement and 11 restricted shares were
released from the escrow and delivered to Network Appliance,
valued in the aggregate at $1,210 based on the fair market value
of our common stock as of the date of the acquisition.
Accordingly, an adjustment was made to goodwill relating to the
WebManage acquisition. The balance of the

escrow shares has been distributed to former
shareholders of WebManage in proportion to their share ownership

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we
acquired Spinnaker and recorded goodwill of $243,604 resulting
from the allocation of the purchase price. See Note 11
Business Combination.

A reconciliation of our previously reported net
income and net income per share to amounts for the exclusion of
goodwill amortization net of the related income tax effect
follows:

Intangible assets balances are summarized as

Amortization expense for identified intangibles
is summarized below:

During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, we
acquired additional patents intended to enhance our technology
base to build next-generation network-attached storage
(“NAS”,) storage area network (“SAN”,) and
fabric-attached storage (“FAS”) systems for the
benefit of our enterprise customers. The costs of such patents
for use in research and development activities that have
alternative future uses have been capitalized and amortized as
intangible assets in accordance with APB Opinion No. 17

“Intangible Assets.”

Capitalized patents are
amortized over an estimated useful life of five years as
research and development expenses.

Existing technology is amortized as cost of
product revenue. Existing technology from the WebManage
acquisition is fully amortized at April 30, 2004

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we
acquired Spinnaker and recorded goodwill and identifiable
intangible assets resulting from the allocation of the purchase
price. Intangible assets include acquired existing technology of
$17,160, trademarks/tradenames of $280, customer
contracts/relationships of $1,110 and covenants not to compete
for $7,610.

Trademarks and tradenames are amortized over an
estimated useful life of three years in sales and marketing
expenses. Customer contracts and relationships are amortized
over an estimated useful life of eighteen months in sales and
marketing expenses.

Covenants not to compete are amortized over an
estimated useful life of eighteen months in general and
administrative expenses.

Based on the identified intangible assets
(including patents) recorded at April 30, 2004, the future
amortization expense of identified intangibles for the next five
fiscal years is as follows:

Guarantees

As of April 30, 2004, our financial
guarantees consisted of standby letters of credit outstanding,
bank guarantee, and restricted cash, which were related to
facility lease requirements, service performance guarantees,
customs and duties guarantees, VAT requirements, and
workers’ compensation plans. The maximum amount of
potential future payments under these arrangements was $4,338
and $2,630 as of April 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Of
this maximum exposure, $2,736 and $1,142 of restricted cash was
classified under Prepaid Expense and Other Assets on our balance
sheet at April 30, 2004 and 2003,



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

respectively. We have not recorded any liability
at April 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to these
guarantees.

As of April 30, 2004, our notional fair
values of foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option
contracts totaled $160,976. We do not believe that these
derivatives present significant credit risks, because the
counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial
institutions, and we manage the notional amount of contracts
entered into with any one counterparty. We do not enter into
derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading
purposes. Other than the risk associated with the financial
condition of the counterparties, our maximum exposure related to
foreign currency forward and option contracts is limited to the
premiums paid.

We offer both recourse and non-recourse lease
financing arrangements to our customers. Under the terms of
recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we
remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments
to the third-party leasing company in the event that any
customers were to default. We defer 100% of the recourse lease
obligation and recognize revenue over the term of the lease as
the lease payments become due. As of April 30, 2004 and
2003, the maximum recourse exposure under such leases totaled
approximately $6,755 and $4,940, respectively. Under the terms
of the non-recourse leases we do not have any continuing
obligations or liabilities. To date, we have not experienced
significant losses under this lease financing program.

We do not maintain a general warranty reserve for
estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is
recognized due to our extensive product quality program and
processes and because our global customer service inventories
utilized to correct product failures are carried at zero cost.

We enter into standard indemnification agreements
in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these
agreements, we agree to defend and indemnify the other party,
primarily our customers or business partners or subcontractors
for damages and reasonable costs incurred in any suit or claim
brought against them alleging that our products sold to them
infringe any U.S. patent, copyright, trade secret or
similar right. If a product becomes the subject of an
infringement claim, we may, at our option: (i) replace the
product with another non-infringing product that provides
substantially similar performance; (ii) modify the
infringing product so that it no longer infringes but remains
functionally equivalent; (iii) obtain the right for the
customer to continue using the product at our expense and for
the reseller to continue selling the product; (iv) take
back the infringing product and refund to customer the purchase
price paid less depreciation amortized on a straight line basis.
We have not been required to make material payments pursuant to
these provisions historically. We have not identified any losses
that are probable under these provisions and, accordingly, we
have not recorded a liability related to these indemnification
provisions.

Subsequent Events

On May 18, 2004, we announced that the Board
has authorized an expansion of the stock repurchase program to
purchase up to $200,000 of outstanding common stock. The
duration of the repurchase program is open-ended. Under the
program, Network Appliance, Inc. could purchase shares of common
stock through open market transactions at prices deemed
appropriate by management. The timing and amount of repurchase
transactions under this program will depend on market conditions
and corporate and regulatory considerations. The purchases will
be funded from available working capital. The stock repurchase
program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls are procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report, is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure Controls are also
designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
as of the end of the period covered by this report (the
“Evaluation Date”). Based on this evaluation, our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective such that the information relating
to Network Appliance, including our consolidated subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) reports (i) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated
and communicated to Network Appliance’s management,
including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

There was no change in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by
this Annual Report on Form 10-K that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. In May 2003, we
implemented new enterprise-wide software, as well as new
business processes and procedures to support the software. These
changes are the result of our normal business process to
evaluate and upgrade or replace our systems software and related
business processes to support our evolving operational needs.
The new software and processes have been used to record and
report our fiscal 2004 financial results.
