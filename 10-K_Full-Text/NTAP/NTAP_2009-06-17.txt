    7,900 employees with operations in over 130 offices around
    the world.

NetApp
    Product Families

We offer highly available, scalable and cost-effective storage
    solutions that incorporate our unified storage platform and the
    feature-rich functionality of our data and storage resource
    management software. Our solutions help improve enterprise
    productivity, performance and profitability, while providing
    investment protection and enhanced asset utilization. Our
    enterprise-class storage solutions are complemented by our
    services expertise to enable interoperability and optimization
    in the context of the application and information technology
    (IT) infrastructure within which they are deployed.

Data
    ONTAP

®

Software

Our Fabric-Attached Storage (“FAS”) and V-Series
    storage solutions are based on Data ONTAP, a highly optimized,
    scalable and flexible operating system that uniquely supports
    any mix of storage area network (“SAN”),
    network-attached storage (“NAS”) and Internet protocol
    SAN (“IP SAN”) environments concurrently. This unified
    storage software platform integrates seamlessly into
    UNIX

®

,

    Linux

®

,

    Windows

®

and Web environments.

The Data ONTAP operating system provides the foundation to build
    a storage infrastructure and an enterprise-wide data fabric for
    mission-critical business applications, while lowering the total
    cost of ownership and complexity typically associated with the
    management of large-scale enterprise data centers.

Data ONTAP GX, our high-performance operating system, supports
    fully integrated, multi-node storage systems within a single
    global name space. This storage grid architecture provides the
    ability to dynamically add storage resources and transparently
    redistribute data without disruption to client systems. We have
    been integrating the Data ONTAP GX functionality with the core
    Data ONTAP capabilities in order to converge both into a single
    operating system.

Data
    Management Software

Our products are in use today in some of the largest data
    centers in the world. These environments require
    enterprise-class management tools. We provide management
    software to increase productivity and simplify data management.
    Such tools include:

•

FlexVol

®

technology,

which enables storage architectures to be more
    efficient and achieve higher utilization using flexible volumes
    that do not require repartitioning of physical storage space;

•

FlexClone

®

technology,

which enables true data cloning using logical
    copies that do not require additional physical storage space,
    and allows for instant replication of data volumes and data sets;

•

Deduplication technology,

which provides the ability to
    eliminate duplicate data within primary and secondary disk
    storage environments, resulting in greater efficiency and higher
    utilization of storage capacity;

•

FlexShare

tm

technology, which directs how storage system resources are used
    to deliver an appropriate level of service for each application;

•

FlexCache

tm

technology, which allows performance acceleration through the
    creation of read-only cached volumes by creating caching volumes
    on multiple storage controllers; and

•

MultiStore

®

software,

which allows partitioning of individual physical
    storage systems into multiple separate logical partitions.



Storage
    Management and Application Integration Software

Our management software family of products provides a broad
    range of storage and data management tools to simplify IT
    administration and enhance flexibility and productivity. We
    deliver differentiated products and collaborate with industry
    open standards and interfaces to deliver this value to
    customers. We have four suites of products targeted to different
    IT administrative roles: Storage Suite, Server Suite, Database
    Suite and Application Suite. The software products within these
    suites are tightly integrated with database and business
    applications software from partners such as Microsoft, Oracle,
    SAP and VMware in order to optimize the performance of those
    applications on our storage systems. Our product offering
    extends into data center automation which provides the
    capability to monitor service levels, manage performance and
    support change management in complex enterprise SAN environments.

FAS Family

Our family of modular, scalable, highly available, unified
    networked storage systems provides seamless access to a full
    range of enterprise data for users on a variety of platforms.
    The FAS 6000, FAS 3000, and the FAS 2000 series
    of fabric-attached enterprise storage systems are designed to
    consolidate UNIX, Windows, NAS, Fibre Channel (“FC”),
    Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (“iSCSI”),
    SAN and Web data in central locations running over the standard
    connection types: Gigabit Ethernet, FC and parallel SCSI (for
    backup). Our design optimizes and consolidates high-performance
    data access for individuals in multi-user environments as well
    as for application servers and server clusters with dedicated
    access. All of our FAS systems are interoperable and run the
    highly efficient Data ONTAP operating system.

V-Series Family

Our V-Series is a network-based virtualization solution that
    consolidates storage from different suppliers behind our data
    management interface, providing SAN and NAS access to the data
    stored in heterogeneous storage arrays. With the V-Series
    solution, customers are able to: transform existing
    heterogeneous, multi-vendor storage systems into a single
    storage pool; simplify storage provisioning and management with
    Data ONTAP thin provisioning; and dramatically lower backup
    time, space and cost with Data ONTAP
    Snapshot

tm

copies. The V-Series is compatible with the FAS family of
    storage systems.

VTL
    Data Protection Systems

Our Virtual Tape Library (“VTL”) solution is a
    disk-to-disk backup appliance that appears as a tape library to
    a backup software application, but provides the superior speed
    and reliability of disk technologies. Our VTL is a
    high-performance, easily managed system that can be used in any
    heterogeneous primary storage environment. Developed
    specifically to address the requirements of backup
    administrators, our VTL solutions increase the performance and
    reliability of backups, simplify backup management and reduce
    storage costs in traditional data center tape backup
    infrastructures.

Data

    Retention and Archive Products

To meet growing regulatory compliance demands faced by most
    enterprises, we offer a broad suite of products to help enable
    data permanence, accessibility and privacy across a variety of
    different regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
    21 CFR Part 11, SEC

Rule 17a-4

and HIPAA. Immutable, cost-effective, resilient and reliable
    storage architectures can be created utilizing
    SnapLock

®

products.



Storage
    Security Products

Security has become a critical element of data management, and
    we have taken a leading role in driving security innovation. Our
    DataFort storage security appliance provides a unified
    platform for data security and key management across NAS, IP
    SAN, FC SAN and tape backup environments. The platform combines
    wire-speed encryption, access controls, authentication and
    automated key management to provide strong security for data at
    rest, while still allowing the capability to search compliant
    data for legal discovery purposes if the need arises.

Performance
    Acceleration Module

The NetApp Performance Acceleration Module (PAM) optimizes the
    performance of random read intensive workloads such as file
    services and messaging. NetApp created this intelligent read
    cache to reduce storage latency and increase I/O throughput
    without adding more fast-spinning disk drives.

NetApp
    Global Services

Our customers demand high availability and reliability of their
    storage infrastructure to ensure the successful, ongoing
    operation of their businesses. NetApp’s global services are
    designed with this in mind. We provide professional services,
    global support solutions and customer education and training to
    help customers most effectively manage their data. The
    professional services and support solutions we offer help our
    customers to resolve business problems, reduce costs, keep
    businesses up and running continuously, comply with regulations
    and policies and improve overall operational results. We utilize
    a global, integrated model to provide consistent service
    delivery and global support during every phase of the customer
    engagement, including assessment and analysis, planning, design,
    installation, implementation, integration, optimization, ongoing
    support and remote management and monitoring. Services and
    support often involve phased rollouts, technology transitions
    and migrations and other long-term engagements.

Principal
    Markets and Distribution Channels

We market and sell our products in numerous countries throughout
    the world and we continue to make investments in our multi-year
    branding and awareness campaign to increase visibility of NetApp
    in the broader IT segment. Our diversified customer base
    represents a number of large segments and vertical markets. We
    focus primarily on the data management and storage markets,
    offering an array of solutions from our ultra high-end products
    designed for large enterprise customers to entry level products
    designed for mid-sized enterprise customers. We have also
    expanded into the VTL and data encryption markets, bringing us
    into parts of the data center in which we have not previously
    competed. We offer storage grid architecture to high-performance
    computing environments with our next-generation operating
    system, Data ONTAP GX.

We employ a multi-channel distribution strategy, selling
    products and services to end users through a direct sales force,
    value-added resellers, system integrators, original equipment
    manufacturers (“OEMs”) and distributors. During fiscal
    2009, two U.S. distributors accounted for approximately
    10.5% and 10.6% of our net revenues, respectively. No customer
    accounted for ten percent or more of our net revenues during
    fiscal 2008 and 2007.

Seasonality

As the size of our business has grown, we have begun to see a
    seasonal decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal
    year. In addition, we also see some international seasonality,
    as sales to European customers are historically weaker during
    the summer months. Sales to the U.S. government tend to be
    seasonally stronger during our second fiscal quarter, concurrent
    with the end of the U.S. federal government’s fiscal
    year in September. Additionally, we derive a majority of our
    revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same
    quarter. Bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality
    patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter.

Backlog

We manufacture products based on a combination of specific order
    requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand. Orders
    are generally placed by customers on an as-needed basis.
    Products are typically shipped



within one to four weeks following receipt of an order. In
    certain circumstances, customers may cancel or reschedule orders
    without penalty. For these reasons, “orders” may not
    constitute a firm backlog and may not be a meaningful indicator
    of future revenues.

Manufacturing
    and Supply Chain

We have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties
    located in Memphis, Tennessee; Fremont, California

,

San Jose, California; Olive Branch, Mississippi;
    Livingston, Scotland; Shanghai, China; Singapore; and Schiphol
    Airport, The Netherlands. These operations include materials
    procurement, commodity management, component engineering, test
    engineering, manufacturing engineering, product assembly,
    product assurance, quality control, final test and global
    logistics. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for
    materials, as well as several key subcontractors for the
    production of certain subassemblies and finished systems. We
    multi-source wherever possible to mitigate supply risk. Our
    strategy has been to develop close relationships with our
    suppliers, exchanging critical information and implementing
    joint quality programs. We also use contract manufacturers for
    the production of major subassemblies to improve our
    manufacturing redundancy. This manufacturing strategy minimizes
    capital investments and overhead expenditures and creates
    flexibility for rapid expansion. We were awarded ISO 9001
    certification on May 29, 1997 and continue to be ISO 9001
    certified. We were awarded ISO 14001 certification on
    December 8, 2004 and continue to be ISO 14001 certified.

Research
    and Development

We conduct research and development activities in various
    locations throughout the world. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    research and development expenses represented 14.6%, 13.7% and
    13.7% of our net revenues, respectively. These costs relate
    primarily to personnel and related costs incurred to conduct
    product development activities. Although we develop many of our
    products internally, we may acquire technology through business
    combinations or through licensing from third parties when
    appropriate. We believe that technical leadership is essential
    to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial
    resources to research and development.

Competition

We compete with many companies in the markets we serve,
    including companies that offer a broad spectrum of IT products
    and services and others that offer specific storage and data
    management products or services. In the storage market, our
    primary and near-line storage system products and our associated
    software portfolio compete primarily with storage system
    products and data management software from EMC, Hitachi Data
    Systems, HP, IBM and Sun Microsystems. In addition, Dell, Inc.
    is a competitor in the storage marketplace through its business
    arrangement with EMC, which allows Dell to resell EMC storage
    hardware and software products, as well as through its
    acquisition of EqualLogic through which Dell offers low-priced
    storage solutions. In the secondary storage market, which
    includes the disk-to-disk backup, compliance and business
    continuity segments, our solutions compete primarily against
    products from EMC and Sun Microsystems. Our VTL products also
    compete with traditional tape backup solutions in the broader
    data backup/recovery space. Additionally, a number of small,
    newer companies have recently entered the storage systems and
    data management software markets, the near-line and VTL storage
    markets and the high-performance clustered storage markets some
    of which may become significant competitors in the future.

We believe that most of these companies compete based on their
    market presence, products, service or price. Some of these
    companies also compete by offering storage and data management
    products or services together with other IT products or
    services, at minimal or no additional cost in order to preserve
    or gain market share.

We believe that we have a number of competitive advantages over
    many of these companies, including product innovation and the
    relationships we have with our customers and partners. We
    believe the advantages of our products include functionality,
    scalability, performance, quality and operational efficiency. We
    believe our advantages in customer and partner relationships
    include a worldwide storage and data management-focused direct
    sales force, a broad network of channel partners, relationships
    with enterprise software vendors, and service offerings that
    enable us to provide our customers with a full range of
    expertise before, during and after their purchase of solutions
    from us.



Customer
    Base

Our diversified customer base spans a number of large segments
    and vertical markets. Examples include: energy, financial
    services, government, high technology, internet, life sciences
    and healthcare services, major manufacturing, media,
    entertainment, animation and video postproduction and
    telecommunications.

    as well. We will continue to evaluate the registration of
    additional trademarks as appropriate. We generally enter into
    confidentiality agreements with our employees, resellers,
    customers, and suppliers. We currently have multiple
    U.S. and international patent applications pending and
    multiple U.S. patents issued.

In addition, through various licensing arrangements, we receive
    certain rights to intellectual property of others. We expect to
    maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing
    arrangements in the future, as needed and to the extent
    available on reasonable terms and conditions, to support
    continued development and sales of our products and services.
    Some of these licensing arrangements require or may require
    royalty payments and other licensing fees. The amount of these
    payments and fees may depend on various factors, including but
    not limited to: the structure of royalty payments, offsetting
    considerations, if any, and the degree of use of the licensed
    technology.

See Item 1A “Risk Factors — We are exposed
    to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and
    protection of intellectual property rights, which could
    adversely affect our operating results.”

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

The following risk factors and other information included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties
    described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks
    and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently
    deem less significant may also impair our business operations.
    Please see page 3 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional discussion of these forward-looking statements.
    If any of the events or circumstances described in the following
    risk factors actually occurs, our business, operating results,
    and financial condition could be materially adversely
    affected.

Our
    operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable
    economic and market conditions, including the current economic
    downturn.

We are subject to the effects of general global economic and
    market conditions challenging economic conditions worldwide have
    from time to time contributed, and are currently contributing,
    to slowdowns in the computer, storage, and networking industries
    at large, as well as the information technology (“IT”)
    market, resulting in:

•

Reduced demand for our products as a result of continued
    constraints on IT related spending by our customers;

•

Increased price competition for our products from competitors;

•

Deferment of purchases and orders by customers due to budgetary
    constraints or changes in current or planned utilization of our
    systems;



•

Risk of excess and obsolete inventories;

•

Excess facilities costs;

•

Higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue;

•

Increased risk of losses or impairment charges related to our
    investment portfolio;

•

Negative impacts from increased financial pressures on
    customers, distributors and resellers;

•

Negative impacts from increased financial pressures on key
    suppliers or contract manufacturers; and

•

Potential discontinuance of product lines or businesses and
    related asset impairments.

The turmoil in the global credit markets, the recent instability
    in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and
    other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global
    economic conditions. The economic challenges we initially
    experienced in the United States have spread throughout the
    world. If global economic and market conditions, or economic
    conditions in the United States or other key markets, remain
    uncertain, persist, or deteriorate further, we may experience
    material adverse impacts on our business, operating results, and
    financial condition.

Our
    quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which could adversely
    impact our common stock price.

We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of
    operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be
    relied upon as indicators of future performance. Our operating
    results have in the past, and will continue to be, subject to
    quarterly fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of
    which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an
    uncertain global economic environment. These factors include,
    but are not limited to, the following:

•

Fluctuations in demand for our products and services, in part
    due to changes in general economic conditions and specific
    economic conditions in the computer, storage, and networking
    industries;

•

A shift in federal government spending patterns;

•

Changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and
    reduced visibility into our customers’ spending plans and
    associated revenue;

•

The level of price and product competition in our target product
    markets;

•

The impact of the current adverse economic and credit
    environment on our customers, channel partners, and suppliers,
    including their ability to obtain financing or to fund capital
    expenditures;

•

The overall movement toward industry consolidations among both
    our competitors and our customers;

•

Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers due to industry
    consolidation, which could subject us to periodic

supply-and-demand,

price rigidity, and quality issues with our components;

•

The timing of bookings or the cancellation of significant orders;

•

Product configuration and mix;

•

The extent to which our customers renew their service and
    maintenance contracts with us;

•

Market acceptance of new products and product enhancements;

•

Announcements and introductions of, and transitions to, new
    products by us or our competitors;

•

Deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or
    product enhancements introduced by us or our competitors;

•

Our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products and
    enhancements in a timely manner;

•

Technological changes in our target product markets;

•

Our levels of expenditure on research and development and sales
    and marketing programs;



•

Our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions;

•

Adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result
    of our international operations;

•

Excess or inadequate facilities;

•

Actual events, circumstances, outcomes and amounts differing
    from judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in determining
    the values of certain assets (including the amounts of valuation
    allowances), liabilities, and other items reflected in our
    consolidated financial statements;

•

Disruptions resulting from new systems and processes as we
    continue to enhance and scale our system infrastructure;

•

Future accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting
    rules, such as the increased use of fair value measures and the
    potential requirement that U.S. registrants prepare
    financial statements in accordance with International Financial
    Reporting Standards (IFRS);

•

Seasonality, such as our historical seasonal decline in revenues
    in the first quarter of our fiscal year and seasonal increase in
    revenues in the second quarter of our fiscal year, with the
    latter due in part to the impact of the U.S. federal
    government’s September 30 fiscal year end on the timing of
    its orders, and

•

Linearity, such as our historical intraquarter revenue pattern
    in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter’s
    total revenues occur in the last month of the quarter.

Due to such factors, operating results for a future period are
    difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not
    necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future
    periods. Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors
    discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect
    on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
    It is possible that in one or more quarters our results may fall
    below our forecasts and the expectations of public market
    analysts and investors. In such event, the trading price of our
    common stock would likely decrease.

Our
    revenue for a particular period is difficult to forecast, and a
    shortfall in revenue may harm our business and our operating
    results.

Our revenues for a particular period are difficult to forecast,
    especially in light of the current global economic downturn and
    related market uncertainty. Product sales are also difficult to
    forecast because the storage and data management market is
    rapidly evolving, and our sales cycle varies substantially from
    customer to customer. New or additional product introductions
    also increase the complexities of forecasting revenues.

Additionally, we derive a majority of our revenue in any given
    quarter from orders booked in the same quarter. Bookings
    typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted
    toward the back end of the quarter. If we do not achieve
    bookings in the latter part of a quarter consistent with our
    quarterly targets, our financial results will be adversely
    impacted.

We use a “pipeline” system, a common industry
    practice, to forecast bookings and trends in our business. Sales
    personnel monitor the status of potential business and estimate
    when a customer will make a purchase decision, the dollar amount
    of the sale and the products or services to be sold. These
    estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a bookings
    pipeline. Our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable
    either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time,
    in part because the “conversion rate” of the pipeline
    into contracts varies from customer to customer, can be
    difficult to estimate, and requires management judgment. Small
    deviations from our forecasted conversion rate may result in
    inaccurate plans and budgets and could materially and adversely
    impact our business or our planned results of operations. In
    particular, the continued adverse events in the economic
    environment and financial markets have made it even more
    difficult for us to forecast our future results and may result
    in a reduction in our quarterly conversion rate as our
    customers’ purchasing decisions are delayed, reduced in
    amount, or cancelled.

Uncertainty about current and future global economic conditions
    has caused consumers, businesses and governments to defer
    purchases in response to tighter credit, decreased cash
    availability and declining customer confidence. Accordingly,
    future demand for our products could differ from our current
    expectations.



We
    have experienced periods of alternating growth and decline in
    revenues and operating expenses. If we are not able to
    successfully manage these fluctuations, our business, financial
    condition and results of operations could be significantly
    impacted.

The ongoing global financial crisis has led to a worldwide
    economic downturn that has negatively affected our business. If
    the current economic downturn continues or worsens, demand for
    our products and services and our revenues may be further
    reduced. A prolonged downturn can adversely affect our revenues,
    gross margin and results of operations. During such economic
    downturns, it is critical to appropriately align our cost
    structure with prevailing market conditions and to minimize the
    effect of such downturns on our operations, while also
    maintaining our capabilities and strategic investments for
    future growth.

Our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to
    future revenues, and a significant percentage of our expenses
    are fixed. We have a limited ability to quickly or significantly
    reduce our fixed costs, and if revenue levels are below our
    expectations, operating results will be adversely impacted.
    During uneven periods of growth, we may incur costs before we
    realize some of the anticipated benefits, which could harm our
    operating results. We have significant investments in
    engineering, sales, service support, marketing programs and
    other functions to support and grow our business. We are likely
    to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier
    than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these
    investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we
    expect, which could harm our business, operating results and
    financial condition.

Conversely, if we are unable to effectively manage our resources
    and capacity, during periods of increasing demand for our
    products, we could experience a material adverse effect on
    operations and financial results. If the network storage market
    fails to grow, or grows slower than we expect, our revenues will
    be adversely affected. Also, even if IT spending increases, our
    revenue may not grow at the same pace.

Our
    gross margins have varied over time and may continue to vary,
    and such variation may make it more difficult to forecast our
    earnings.

Our product gross margins have been and may continue to be
    affected by a variety of factors, including:

•

Demand for storage and data management products;

•

Pricing actions, rebates, initiatives, discount levels, and
    price competition;

•

Direct versus indirect and OEM sales;

•

Changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including mix
    of configurations within each product group;

•

Product and add-on software mix;

•

The mix of services as a percentage of revenue;

•

The mix and average selling prices of products;

•

The mix of disk content;

•

The timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals;

•

New product introductions and enhancements;

•

Excess inventory purchase commitments as a result of changes in
    demand forecasts and possible product and software defects as we
    transition our products; and

•

The cost of components, manufacturing labor, quality, warranty,
    and freight.

Changes in software entitlements and maintenance gross margins
    may result from various factors, such as:

•

The size of the installed base of products under support
    contracts;

•

The timing of technical support service contract renewals;

•

Demand for and the timing of delivery of upgrades;



•

The timing of our technical support service initiatives; and

•

The level of spending on our customer support infrastructure.

Changes in service gross margins may result from various
    factors, such as:

•

The mix of customers;

•

The size and timing of service contract renewals;

•

The volume and use of outside partners to deliver support
    services on our behalf; and

•

Product quality and serviceability issues.

Due to such factors, gross margins are subject to variations
    from period to period and are difficult to predict.

Our
    cost-reduction initiatives and restructuring plans may not
    result in anticipated savings or more efficient operations. Our
    recently-announced restructuring may disrupt our operations and
    adversely affect our operations and financial
    results.

On February 11, 2009, in response to the worsening global
    economic conditions and uncertainty about future IT spending, we
    announced a restructuring of our worldwide operations in an
    effort to strategically align our cost structure with expected
    revenues, as well as to reallocate resources into areas of our
    business with more growth potential.

Additionally, in December 2008, we decided to cease development
    and availability of our
    SnapMirror

®

for Open Systems (“SMOS”) product, and as a result
    recorded restructuring and other charges attributable primarily
    to severance and employee-related and facility closure costs, as
    well as the impairment of certain acquired intangible assets.

We may not be able to successfully complete and realize the
    expected benefits of these restructuring plans. Our
    restructuring plans may involve higher costs or a longer
    timetable, or they may fail to improve our gross margins,
    results of operations and cash flows as we anticipate. Our
    inability to realize these benefits may result in an ineffective
    business structure that could negatively impact our results of
    operations. In addition to costs related to severance and other
    employee-related costs, our restructuring plans may also subject
    us to litigation risks and expenses.

In addition, our restructuring plans may have other adverse
    consequences, such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in
    workforce, the loss of employees with valuable knowledge or
    expertise, a negative impact on employee morale, or a gain in
    competitive advantage by our competitors over us. The
    restructuring efforts could also be disruptive to our day-to-day
    operations and cause our remaining employees to be less
    productive, which in turn may affect our revenue and other
    operating results in the future. In the event that the economy
    recovers sooner than we expect and results in increased IT
    spending, we may not have sufficient capacity to capitalize on
    the related increase in demand for our products and services.

We may undertake future cost-reduction initiatives and
    restructuring plans that may adversely impact our operations;
    and we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our
    prior or any future restructurings.

Changes
    in market conditions have led, and in the future could lead, to
    charges related to the discontinuance of certain of our products
    and asset impairments.

In response to changes in economic conditions and market
    demands, we may be required to strategically realign our
    resources and consider cost containment measures including
    restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise discontinuing certain
    products. Any decision to limit investment in, dispose of, or
    otherwise exit products may result in the recording of charges
    to earnings, such as inventory and technology-related or other
    intangible asset write-offs, workforce reduction costs, charges
    relating to consolidation of excess facilities, cancellation
    penalties or claims from third parties who were resellers or
    users of discontinued products, which would harm our operating
    results. Our estimates with respect to the useful life or
    ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets,
    including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result
    of such assessments and decisions. Additionally, we



are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual
    basis, and between annual tests in certain circumstances when
    impairment indicators exist or if certain events or changes in
    circumstances have occurred. Future goodwill impairment tests
    may result in charges to earnings, which could materially harm
    our operating results.

Our
    OEM relationship with IBM may not continue to generate
    significant revenue.

In April 2005, we entered into an OEM agreement with IBM, which
    enables IBM to sell IBM branded solutions based on NetAppunified
    solutions, including
    NearStore

®

and V-Series systems, as well as associated software offerings.
    While this agreement is an element of our strategy to expand our
    reach into more customers and countries, we do not have an
    exclusive relationship with IBM, and there is no minimum
    commitment for any given period of time; therefore, this
    relationship may not continue to contribute revenue in future
    years. In addition, we have no control over the products that
    IBM selects to sell, or its release schedule and timing of those
    products; nor do we control its pricing. In the event that sales
    through IBM increase, we may experience distribution channel
    conflicts between our direct sales force and IBM or among our
    channel partners. If we fail to minimize channel conflicts, our
    operating results and financial condition could be harmed. We
    cannot assure you that this OEM relationship will continue to
    generate significant revenue while the agreement is in effect,
    or that the relationship will continue to be in effect for any
    specific period of time.

If we
    are unable to maintain our existing relationships and develop
    new relationships with major strategic partners, our revenue may
    be impacted negatively.

An element of our strategy to increase revenue is to
    strategically partner with major third-party software and
    hardware vendors that integrate our products into their products
    and also co-market our products with these vendors. We have
    significant partner relationships with database, business
    application, backup management and server virtualization
    companies, including Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Symantec and
    VMware. A number of these strategic partners are industry
    leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage
    market. There is intense competition for attractive strategic
    partners, and even if we can establish relationships with these
    or other partners, these partnerships may not generate
    significant revenue or may not continue to be in effect for any
    specific period of time. If these relationships fail to
    materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product
    development or other operational difficulties.

We intend to continue to establish and maintain business
    relationships with technology companies to accelerate the
    development and marketing of our storage solutions. To the
    extent that we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships
    or maintaining our existing relationships, our future revenue
    and operating results could be impacted negatively. In addition,
    the loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse
    effect on our revenues and operating results.

Disruption
    of or changes in our distribution model could harm our
    sales.

If we fail to manage distribution of our products and services
    properly, or if our distributors’ financial condition or
    operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be
    adversely affected.

We market and sell our storage solutions directly through our
    worldwide sales force and indirectly through channel partners
    such as value-added resellers, systems integrators,
    distributors, OEMs and strategic business partners, and we
    derive a significant portion of our revenue from these channel
    partners. During fiscal 2009, revenues generated from sales
    through our channel partners accounted for 69.0% of our
    revenues. In order for us to maintain or increase our revenues,
    we must effectively manage our relationships with channel
    partners.

Several factors could result in disruption of or changes in our
    distribution model, which could materially harm our revenues and
    gross margins, including the following:

•

We compete with some of our channel partners through our direct
    sales force, which may lead these partners to use other
    suppliers who do not directly sell their own products;

•

Our channel partners may demand that we absorb a greater share
    of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear;



•

Our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources
    and may not be able to withstand changes and challenges in
    business conditions; and

•

Revenue from indirect sales could suffer if our channel
    partners’ financial condition or operations weaken.

In addition, we depend on our channel partners to comply with
    applicable regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which
    they operate. Their failure to do so could have a material
    adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.

The
    U.S. government has contributed to our revenue growth and has
    become an important customer for us. Future revenue from the
    U.S. government is subject to shifts in government spending
    patterns. A decrease in government demand for our products could
    materially affect our revenues. In addition, our business could
    be adversely affected as a result of future examinations by the
    U.S. government.

The U.S. government has become an important customer for
    the storage market and for us; however, government demand is
    unpredictable, and there can be no assurance that we will
    maintain or grow our revenue from the U.S. government.
    Government agencies are subject to budgetary processes and
    expenditure constraints that could lead to delays or decreased
    capital expenditures in IT spending. If the government or
    individual agencies within the government reduce or shift their
    capital spending patterns, our revenues and operating results
    may be harmed.

In addition, selling our products to the U.S. government
    also subjects us to certain regulatory requirements. The failure
    to comply with these requirements could subject us to fines and
    other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on
    our revenues and operating results. For example, in April 2009,
    we entered into a settlement agreement with the United States of
    America, acting through the United States Department of Justice
    (“DOJ”) and on behalf of the General Services
    Administration (the “GSA”), under which we agreed to
    pay the United States $128.0 million, plus interest of
    $0.7 million, related to a dispute regarding our discount
    practices and compliance with the price reduction clause
    provisions of its GSA contracts between August 1997 and February
    2005. We are currently in discussions with the
    U.S. government to demonstrate that we have implemented
    processes and procedures to ensure that we comply with federal
    contracting rules. If we are unable to demonstrate to the
    U.S. government that we have implemented such improved
    policies and procedures or if we are subject to an adverse
    outcome in any future examinations of our federal contracting
    practices, we could be suspended or debarred from contracting
    with the U.S. government generally, or with any specific
    agency, which could materially and adversely affect our revenue
    and operating results.

A
    portion of our revenue is generated by large, recurring
    purchases from various customers, resellers and distributors. A
    loss, cancellation or delay in purchases by these parties has
    and could continue to negatively affect our
    revenue.

During fiscal 2009, two U.S. distributors accounted for
    approximately 10.5% and 10.6% of our revenues, respectively. The
    loss of continued orders from any of our more significant
    customers, strategic partners, distributors or resellers could
    cause our revenue and profitability to suffer. Our ability to
    attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors,
    including the cost-effectiveness, reliability, scalability,
    breadth and depth of our products.

We generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with
    our customers for an extended period of time, and thus we may
    not be able to continue to receive large, recurring orders from
    these customers, resellers or distributors. For example, our
    reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases
    and our customers, resellers and distributors can stop
    purchasing and marketing our products at any time.

Recent turmoil in the credit markets may further negatively
    impact our operations by affecting the solvency of our
    customers, resellers and distributors, or the ability of our
    customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products.
    If the global economy and credit markets continue to deteriorate
    and our future sales decline, our financial condition and
    operating results could be adversely impacted.

Because our expenses are based on our revenue forecasts, a
    substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to, or
    unexpected returns from, customers and resellers, or the loss of
    any significant customer or reseller,



could harm our business. Although our largest customers may vary
    from period to period, we anticipate that our operating results
    for any given period will continue to depend on large orders
    from significant customers. In addition, a change in the mix of
    our customers could adversely affect our revenue and gross
    margins.

We are
    exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers, resellers,
    and distributors, as well as credit exposures in weakened
    markets, which could result in material losses.

Most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis, with
    typical payment terms of 30 days in the United States
    and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some
    markets outside the United States. We monitor individual
    customer payment capability in granting such open credit
    arrangements, and seek to limit such open credit to amounts we
    believe the customers can pay. Beyond our open credit
    arrangements, we also have recourse or nonrecourse customer
    financing leasing arrangements with third party leasing
    companies through preexisting relationships with customers.
    Under the terms of recourse leases, which are treated as
    off-balance sheet arrangements, we remain liable for the
    aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third party
    leasing company in the event that any customers default. We
    expect demand for customer financing to continue. During periods
    of economic downturn in the storage industry and the global
    economy, our exposure to credit risks from our customers
    increases. In addition, our exposure to credit risks of our
    customers may increase if our customers and their customers or
    their lease financing sources are adversely affected by the
    current global economic downturn, or if there is a continuation
    or worsening of the downturn. Although we have programs in place
    to monitor and mitigate the associated risks, such programs may
    not be effective in reducing our credit risks.

In the past, there have been bankruptcies by our customers both
    who have open credit and who have lease financing arrangements
    with us, causing us to incur bad debt charges, and, in the case
    of financing arrangements, a loss of revenues. There can be no
    assurance that additional losses will not occur in future
    periods. Any future losses could harm our business and have a
    material adverse effect on our operating results and financial
    condition. Additionally, to the extent that the recent turmoil
    in the credit markets makes it more difficult for customers to
    obtain open credit or lease financing, those customers’
    ability to purchase our product could be adversely impacted,
    which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our
    financial condition and operating results.

The
    market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly
    in the past and will likely continue to do so in the
    future.

The market price for our common stock has experienced
    substantial volatility in the past, and several factors could
    cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These
    factors include but are not limited to:

•

Fluctuations in our operating results;

•

Variations between our operating results and either the guidance
    we have furnished to the public or the published expectations of
    securities analysts;

•

Economic developments in the storage and data management market
    as a whole;

•

Fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by
    investors to be comparable to us;

•

Changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections;

•

Inquiries by the SEC, NASDAQ, law enforcement, or other
    regulatory bodies;

•

International conflicts and acts of terrorism;

•

Announcements of new products, applications, or product
    enhancements by us or our competitors;

•

Changes in our relationships with our suppliers, customers,
    channel and strategic partners; and

•

General market conditions, including the recent financial and
    credit crisis and global economic downturn.

In addition, the stock market has experienced volatility that
    has particularly affected the market prices of the equity
    securities of many technology companies. Certain macroeconomic
    factors such as changes in interest rates, the market climate
    for the technology sector, and levels of corporate spending on
    IT, as well as variations in our expected operating performance,
    could continue to have an impact on the trading price of our
    stock. As a result, the



market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in
    the future, and any broad market decline may materially and
    adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

If we
    are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to
    technological change, if our new products do not achieve market
    acceptance, if we fail to manage the transition between our new
    and old products, or if we cannot provide the expected level of
    service and support for our new products, our operating results
    could be materially and adversely affected.

Our future growth depends upon the successful development and
    introduction of new hardware and software products. Due to the
    complexity of storage subsystems and storage security appliances
    and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to
    produce new products, such products are subject to significant
    technical risks. In addition, our new products must respond to
    technological changes and evolving industry standards. If we are
    unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and
    introduce new products in a timely manner in response to
    changing market conditions or customer requirements, or if such
    products do not achieve market acceptance, our operating results
    could be materially and adversely affected. New or additional
    product introductions increase the complexities of forecasting
    revenues, and if not managed effectively, may adversely affect
    our sales of existing products.

As new or enhanced products are introduced, we must successfully
    manage the transition from older products in order to minimize
    disruption in customers’ ordering patterns, avoid excessive
    levels of older product inventories, and ensure that enough
    supplies of new products can be delivered to meet
    customers’ demands.

As we enter new or emerging markets, we will likely increase
    demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed
    to additional competition. We may not be able to provide
    products, service and support to effectively compete for these
    market opportunities.

An
    increase in competition and industry consolidation could
    materially and adversely affect our operating
    results.

The storage markets are intensely competitive and are
    characterized by rapidly changing technology. In the storage
    market, our primary and near-line storage system products and
    our associated software portfolio compete primarily with storage
    system products and data management software from EMC, Hitachi
    Data Systems, HP, IBM, and Sun Microsystems. In addition, Dell,
    Inc. is a competitor in the storage marketplace through its
    business arrangement with EMC, which allows Dell to resell EMC
    storage hardware and software products, as well as through
    Dell’s acquisition of EqualLogic, through which Dell offers
    low-priced storage solutions. In the secondary storage market,
    which includes the disk-to-disk backup, compliance and business
    continuity segments, our solutions compete primarily against
    products from EMC and Sun Microsystems. Our VTL products also
    compete with traditional tape backup solutions in the broader
    data backup/recovery space. Additionally, a number of small,
    newer companies have recently entered the storage systems and
    data management software markets, the near-line and VTL storage
    markets and the high-performance clustered storage markets, some
    of which may become significant competitors in the future.

There has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our
    markets for several years. For example, in April 2009, Oracle
    Corporation, one of our strategic partners, announced its plan
    to acquire Sun Microsystems. We expect this trend to continue as
    companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions
    in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are
    unable to continue operations. We believe that industry
    consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better
    able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. In
    addition, current and potential competitors have established or
    may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with
    third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors
    or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire
    significant market share. We may not be able to compete
    successfully against current or future competitors. Competitive
    pressures we face could materially and adversely affect our
    business and operating results.



Our
    future financial performance depends on growth in the storage
    and data management markets. If these markets do not perform as
    we expect and upon which we calculate and forecast our revenues,
    our operating results will be materially and adversely
    impacted.

All of our products address the storage and data management
    markets. Accordingly, our future financial performance will
    depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and data
    management markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging
    standards in these markets. The markets for storage and data
    management have been adversely impacted by the current global
    economic downturn and may not grow as anticipated or may
    continue to decline.

Additionally, emerging standards in these markets may adversely
    affect the
    UNIX

®

,

    Windows

®

and the World Wide Web server markets upon which we depend. For
    example, we provide our open access data retention solutions to
    customers within the financial services, healthcare,
    pharmaceutical and government market segments, industries that
    are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with
    respect to data access, reliability and permanence (such as
    Rule 17(a)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended) in the United States and in the other countries in
    which we operate. If our products do not meet and continue to
    comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this
    regard, customers in these market and geographical segments will
    not purchase our products, and we will not be able to expand our
    product offerings in these market and geographical segments at
    the rates which we have forecasted.

Supply
    chain issues, including financial problems of contract
    manufacturers or component suppliers, or a shortage of adequate
    component supply or manufacturing capacity that increase our
    costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, could
    have a material adverse impact on our business and operating
    results, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly
    may result in excess or obsolete component supply, which could
    adversely affect our gross margins.

The fact that we do not own or operate our manufacturing
    facilities and supply chain exposes us to risks, including
    reduced control over quality assurance, production costs and
    product supply, which could have a material adverse impact on
    the supply of our products and on our business and operating
    results.

Financial problems of either contract manufacturers or component
    suppliers could limit supply, increase costs, or result in
    accelerated payment terms. The loss of any contract manufacturer
    or key supplier could negatively impact our ability to
    manufacture and sell our products. Qualifying a new contract
    manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and
    time-consuming. If we are required to change contract
    manufacturers, we may lose revenue and damage our customer
    relationships. Disruption or termination of manufacturing
    capacity or component supply could delay shipments of our
    products and could materially and adversely affect our operating
    results. Such delays could also damage relationships with
    current and prospective customers and suppliers, and our
    competitive position and reputation could be harmed.

A return to growth in the economy is likely to put greater
    pressures on us, our contract manufacturers and our suppliers to
    accurately project demand and to establish optimal purchase
    commitment levels. Additionally, the reservation of
    manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other
    companies, inside or outside of our industry, or the inability
    by us to appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our
    manufacturing or components requirements based upon business
    needs could result in either limitation of supply or increased
    costs from these suppliers.

If we inaccurately forecast demand for our products or if there
    is lack of demand for our products, we may have excess or
    inadequate inventory or incur cancellation charges or penalties,
    which would increase our costs and have an adverse impact on our
    gross margins.

We rely on a limited number of suppliers for components such as
    disk drives, computer boards and microprocessors utilized in the
    assembly of our products. In recent years, rapid industry
    consolidation has led to fewer component suppliers, which has
    and could subject us to future periodic supply constraints and
    price rigidity.

Furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase
    commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase
    components at prices that are higher than those available in the
    current market, or in amounts greater than



our needs. In the event that we become committed to purchase
    components at prices in excess of the current market price when
    the components are actually used, or are committed to buy
    components in amounts greater than our needs, our gross margins
    could decrease.

Component quality is a risk and is particularly significant with
    respect to our suppliers of disk drives. In order to meet
    product performance requirements, we must obtain disk drives of
    extremely high quality and capacity.

As suppliers upgrade their components, they regularly “end
    of life” older components. As we become aware of an end of
    life situation, we attempt to make purchases or purchase
    commitments to cover all future requirements or find a suitable
    substitute component. We may not be able to obtain a sufficient
    supply of components on a timely and cost effective basis. Our
    failure to do so may lead to an adverse impact on our business.
    On the other hand, if we fail to anticipate customer demand
    properly or if there is reduced demand or no demand for our
    products, an oversupply of end of life components could result
    in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our
    gross margins.

We intend to regularly introduce new products and product
    enhancements, which will require us to rapidly achieve volume
    production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and
    suppliers. We may need to increase our material purchases,
    contract manufacturing capacity and quality functions to meet
    anticipated demand. The inability of our contract manufacturers
    or our component suppliers to provide us with adequate supplies
    of high-quality products and materials suitable for our needs
    could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders.

Our
    acquisitions may not provide the anticipated benefits and may
    disrupt our existing business.

As part of our strategy, we are continuously evaluating
    opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would
    complement our current products, expand the breadth of our
    markets, or enhance our technical capabilities. On May 20,
    2009, we announced that we have entered into a definitive
    agreement to acquire Data Domain, Inc. (“Data
    Domain”). We subsequently amended the terms of the
    definitive agreement on June 3, 2009.

The success of this and any future acquisition is impacted by a
    number of factors, and may be subject to the following risks:

•

The inability to successfully integrate the operations,
    technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies;

•

The diversion of management’s attention from normal daily
    operations of the business;

•

The loss of key employees; and

•

Substantial transaction costs and accounting charges.

•

Exposure to litigation related to acquisitions. For example, see
    the lawsuit related to Data Domain described in Part I,
    Item 3 Legal Proceedings below.

This and any future acquisitions may also result in risks to our
    existing business, including:

•

Dilution of our current stockholders’ percentage ownership
    to the extent we issue new equity;

•

Assumption of additional liabilities;

•

Incurrence of additional debt or a decline in available cash;
    adverse effects to our financial statements, such as the need to
    make large and immediate write-offs or the incurrence of
    restructuring and other related expenses;

•

Liability for intellectual property infringement and other
    litigation claims, which we may or may not be aware of at the
    time of acquisition; and

•

Creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could
    result in significant future amortization expense or impairment
    charges.

In addition, failure to complete the Data Domain acquisition as
    planned could negatively impact our stock price.

The failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of an
    acquisition may also result in impairment charges for goodwill
    or acquired intangibles. For example, in fiscal 2009 we
    announced our decision to cease the development



and availability of our SMOS product, which was originally
    acquired through our acquisition of Topio, Inc.
    (“Topio”) in fiscal 2007, resulting in the impairment
    of acquired intangibles related to such acquisition. Additional
    or realized risks of this nature could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

The occurrence of any of the above risks could seriously harm
    our business.

We are
    exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio
    investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments
    could harm our financial results.

At April 24, 2009, we had $2.6 billion in cash, cash
    equivalents, available-for-sale securities and restricted cash
    and investments. We invest our cash in a variety of financial
    instruments, consisting principally of investments in
    U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency
    bonds, corporate bonds, corporate securities, auction rate
    securities, certificates of deposit, and money market funds,
    including the Primary Fund. These investments are subject to
    general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which
    have been exacerbated by unusual events such as the financial
    and credit crisis, and bankruptcy filings in the United States
    which have affected various sectors of the financial markets and
    led to global credit and liquidity issues. These securities are
    generally classified as “available-for-sale” and,
    consequently, are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at
    fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net
    of tax.

Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest
    earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed
    rate debt securities may have their market value adversely
    impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate
    securities may produce less income than expected if interest
    rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment
    income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest
    rates. Currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments
    in our investment portfolio. We may suffer losses if forced to
    sell securities that have experienced a decline in market value
    because of changes in interest rates. Currently, we do not use
    financial derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure.

The fair value of our investments may change significantly due
    to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets.
    These securities/issuers could be subject to review for possible
    downgrade. Any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in
    an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our
    investments. Changes in the various assumptions used to value
    these securities and any increase in the markets’ perceived
    risk associated with such investments may also result in a
    decline in estimated fair value. If such investments suffer
    market price declines, as we experienced with some of our
    investments during fiscal 2009, we may recognize in earnings the
    decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost
    basis when the decline is judged to be

other-than-temporary.

As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers, which
    occurred during fiscal 2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary
    impairment charge of $11.8 million on our corporate bonds
    related to investments in Lehman Brothers securities and
    approximately $9.3 million on our investments in the
    Primary Fund that held Lehman Brothers investments. As of
    April 24, 2009, we have an investment in the Primary Fund,
    an AAA-rated money market fund at the time of purchase, with a
    par value of $60.9 million and an estimated fair value of
    $51.6 million, which suspended redemptions in September
    2008 and is in the process of liquidating its portfolio of
    investments. We received total distributions of
    $546.3 million during fiscal 2009 from the Primary Fund. On
    December 3, 2008, it announced a plan for liquidation and
    distribution of assets that includes the establishment of a
    special reserve to be set aside out of its assets for pending or
    threatened claims, as well as anticipated costs and expenses,
    including related legal and accounting fees. On
    February 26, 2009, the Primary Fund announced a plan to set
    aside $3.5 billion of the fund’s remaining assets as
    the “special reserve” which may be increased or
    decreased as further information becomes available. The Primary
    Fund has received an SEC order providing that the SEC will
    supervise the distribution of assets from the Primary Fund. Our
    pro rata share of the $3.5 billion special reserve is
    approximately $41.5 million. The Primary Fund plans to
    continue to make periodic distributions, up to the amount of the
    special reserve, on a pro-rata basis. We could realize
    additional losses in our holdings of the Primary Fund and may
    not receive all or a portion of our remaining balance in the
    Primary Fund as a result of market conditions and ongoing
    litigation against the fund.



If the conditions in the credit and capital markets continue to
    worsen, our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could
    determine that more of our investments have experienced an
    other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring further
    impairments, which could adversely impact our financial position
    and operating results.

Funds
    associated with certain of our auction rate securities may not
    be accessible for more than 12 months and our auction rate
    securities may experience further other-than-temporary declines
    in value, which would adversely affect our
    earnings.

Auction rate securities (“ARS”) held by us are
    securities with long-term nominal maturities, which, in
    accordance with investment policy guidelines, had credit ratings
    of AAA and Aaa at time of purchase. Interest rates for ARS are
    reset through a “Dutch auction” each month, which
    prior to February 2008 had provided a liquid market for these
    securities.

Substantially all of our ARS are backed by pools of student
    loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education, and
    we believe the credit quality of these securities is high based
    on this guarantee. However liquidity issues in the global credit
    markets resulted in the failure of auctions for certain of our
    ARS investments, with a par value of $73.3 million at
    April 24, 2009. For each failed auction, the interest rate
    resets to a maximum rate defined for each security, and the ARS
    continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms,
    although the principal associated with the ARS will not be
    accessible until there is a successful auction or such time as
    other markets for ARS investments develop.

As of April 24, 2009, we determined there was a total
    decline in the fair value of our ARS investments of
    approximately $8.8 million, of which we recorded temporary
    impairment charges of $7.0 million, offset by unrealized
    gains of $0.3 million, and $2.1 million was recognized
    as an other-than-temporary impairment charge. In addition, we
    have classified all of our auction rate securities as long-term
    assets in our consolidated balance sheets of April 24, 2009
    as our ability to liquidate such securities in the next
    12 months is uncertain. Although we currently have the
    ability and intent to hold these ARS investments until recovery
    in market value or until maturity, if the current market
    conditions deteriorate further, or the anticipated recovery in
    market liquidity does not occur, we may be required to record
    additional impairment charges in future quarters.

Our
    leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our
    financial condition and results of operations.

As a result of our sale of $1.265 billion of 1.75%
    convertible senior notes in June 2008 (the “Notes”),
    we have a greater amount of long-term debt than we have
    maintained in the past. We also have a credit facility and
    various synthetic lease arrangements. In addition, subject to
    the restrictions in our existing and any future financings
    agreements, we may incur additional debt.

Our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have
    adverse consequences including:

•

Adversely affecting our ability to satisfy our obligations;

•

Increasing the portion of our cash flows from operations may
    have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may
    not be available for operations, working capital, capital
    expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or
    other purposes;

•

Impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the
    future;

•

Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to,
    changes in our business and industry; and

•

Making us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our
    industry or the economy in general.

Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will
    depend on our future performance, which will be affected by
    financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We
    will not be able to control many of these factors, such as
    economic conditions and governmental regulations. Furthermore,
    our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows from
    operations to enable us to meet our expenses and service our
    debt. As a result, we may be required to repatriate funds from
    our foreign subsidiaries, which could result in a significant
    tax liability to us. If we are unable to generate sufficient
    cash flows from operations, or if we are unable to repatriate
    sufficient or any funds from our foreign subsidiaries, in order
    to meet our expenses and debt service obligations, we may need
    to utilize our existing line of credit to obtain the necessary
    funds, or we may be required to raise additional funds. If we
    determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any
    reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding
    is



available, obtain it on acceptable terms. If we fail to make a
    payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt, and
    this default could cause us to be in default on our other
    outstanding indebtedness.

We are
    subject to restrictive and financial covenants in our credit
    facility and synthetic lease arrangements. The restrictive
    covenants may restrict our ability to operate our
    business.

Our access to undrawn amounts under our credit facility and the
    ongoing extension of credit under our synthetic lease
    arrangements are subject to continued compliance with financial
    covenants, which could be more challenging in a difficult
    operating environment. If we do not comply with these
    restrictive and financial covenants or otherwise default under
    the facility or arrangements, we may be required to repay any
    outstanding amounts under this credit facility or repurchase the
    properties and facility which are subject to the synthetic lease
    arrangements. If we lose access to these credit facility and
    synthetic lease arrangements, we may not be able to obtain
    alternative financing on acceptable terms, which could limit our
    operating flexibility.

The agreements governing our credit facility and synthetic lease
    arrangements contain restrictive covenants that limit our
    ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our
    ability to:

•

Incur indebtedness;

•

Incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level;

•

Grant liens;

•

Sell all or substantially all our assets:

•

Enter into certain mergers;

•

Change our business;

•

Enter into swap agreements;

•

Enter into transactions with our affiliates; and

•

Enter into certain restrictive agreements.

As a result of these restrictive covenants, our ability to
    respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to
    obtain additional financing, if needed, may be significantly
    restricted. We may also be prevented from engaging in
    transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, such as
    strategic acquisitions or joint ventures.

We are also required to comply with financial covenants under
    our credit facility and synthetic lease arrangements, and our
    ability to comply with these financial covenants is dependent on
    our future performance, which will be subject to many factors,
    some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing
    economic conditions.

Our failure to comply with the restrictive and financial
    covenants could result in a default under our credit facility
    and our synthetic lease arrangements, which would give the
    counterparties thereto the ability to exercise certain rights,
    including the right to accelerate the amounts owed thereunder
    and to terminate the arrangement, and could also result in a
    cross default with respect to our other indebtedness. In
    addition, our failure to comply with these covenants and the
    acceleration of amounts owed under our credit facility and
    synthetic lease arrangements could result in a default under the
    Notes, which could permit the holders to accelerate the Notes.
    If all of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient
    funds available to repay such debt.

Future
    issuances of common stock and hedging activities by holders of
    the Notes may depress the trading price of our common stock and
    the Notes.

Any new issuance of equity securities, including the issuance of
    shares upon conversion of the Notes, could dilute the interests
    of our existing stockholders, including holders who receive
    shares upon conversion of their Notes, and could substantially
    decrease the trading price of our common stock and the Notes. We
    may issue equity securities in the future for a number of
    reasons, including to finance our operations and business
    strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic
    collaborations or other transactions), to increase our capital,
    to adjust our



ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the
    exercise of outstanding warrants or options, or for other
    reasons.

In addition, the price of our common stock could also be
    affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who
    view the Notes as a more attractive means of equity
    participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading
    activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock by
    holders of the Notes. The hedging or arbitrage could, in turn,
    affect the trading price of the Notes, or any common stock that
    holders receive upon conversion of the Notes.

Conversion
    of our Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing
    stockholders.

The conversion of some or all of our outstanding Notes will
    dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the
    extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the Notes.
    Upon conversion of a Note, we will satisfy our conversion
    obligation by delivering cash for the principal amount of the
    Note and shares of common stock, if any, to the extent the
    conversion value exceeds the principal amount. There would be no
    adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share
    computation for the cash settled portion of the Notes as that
    portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash.
    The number of shares delivered upon conversion, if any, will be
    included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net
    income per common share. Any sales in the public market of any
    common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely
    affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In
    addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling
    by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could
    be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of
    the Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the
    price of our common stock.

The
    note hedges and warrant transactions that we entered into in
    connection with the sale of the Notes may affect the trading
    price of our common stock.

In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into
    privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with
    certain option counterparties (the “Counterparties”),
    which are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our
    common stock upon any conversion of the Notes. At the same time,
    we also entered into warrant transactions with the
    Counterparties pursuant to which we may issue shares of our
    common stock above a certain strike price. In connection with
    these hedging transactions, the Counterparties may have entered
    into various over-the-counter derivative transactions with
    respect to our common stock or purchased shares of our common
    stock in secondary market transactions at or following the
    pricing of the Notes. Such activities may have had the effect of
    increasing the price of our common stock. The Counterparties are
    likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior
    to conversion or maturity of the Notes by purchasing and selling
    shares of our common stock or entering into other derivative
    transactions. Additionally, these transactions may expose us to
    counterparty credit risk for nonperformance. We manage our
    exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum
    credit standards and the diversification of counterparties. The
    effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on
    the market price of our common stock or the Notes will depend,
    in part, on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this
    time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the
    value of our common stock. In addition, if our stock price
    exceeds the strike price for the warrants, there could be
    additional dilution to our shareholders, which could adversely
    affect the value of our common stock.

Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives, Inc. (“Lehman OTC”)
    is the counterparty to 20% of our Note hedges. The bankruptcy
    filing by Lehman OTC on October 3, 2008 constituted an
    “event of default” under the hedge transaction that
    could, at our option, lead to termination under the hedge
    transaction to the extent we provide notice to Lehman OTC.
    We have not terminated the Note hedge transaction with Lehman
    OTC, and will continue to carefully monitor the developments
    impacting Lehman OTC. This “event of default” is not
    expected to have an impact on our financial position or results
    of operations. However, we could incur significant costs if we
    elect to replace this hedge transaction originally held with
    Lehman OTC. If we do not elect to replace this hedge
    transaction, then we would be subject to potential dilution upon
    conversion of the Notes if on the date of conversion the
    per-share market price of our common stock exceeds the
    conversion price of $31.85. The terms of the Notes, the rights
    of the holders of the Notes and other counterparties to Note
    hedges and warrants were not affected by the bankruptcy filings
    of Lehman OTC.



Our
    synthetic leases are off-balance sheet arrangements that could
    negatively affect our financial condition and results. We have
    invested substantial resources in new facilities and physical
    infrastructure, which will increase our fixed costs. Our
    operating results could be harmed if our business does not grow
    proportionately to our increase in fixed costs.

We have various synthetic lease arrangements with BNP Paribas
    Leasing Corporation as lessor (“BBPPLC”) for our
    headquarters office buildings and land in Sunnyvale, California.
    On April 1, 2009, we terminated two of the synthetic lease
    arrangements in an effort to manage our capital structure in
    light of the current economic environment. The lease payments
    commitments associated with the remaining arrangements as of the
    termination date totaled $141.1 million through fiscal
    2013. These synthetic leases qualify for operating lease
    accounting treatment under SFAS No. 13,
    “Accounting for Leases (as amended),” and are not
    considered variable interest entities under
    FIN No. 46R “Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities (revised).” Therefore, we do not include the
    properties or the associated debt on our condensed consolidated
    balance sheet. However, if circumstances were to change
    regarding our or BNPPLC’s ownership of the properties, or
    in BNPPLC’s overall portfolio, we could be required to
    consolidate the entity, the leased facilities and the associated
    debt.

Our future minimum lease payments under these synthetic leases
    limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes
    in our business by restricting the funds available for use in
    addressing such changes. If we are unable to grow our business
    and revenues proportionately to our increase in fixed costs, our
    operating results will be harmed. If we elect not to purchase
    the properties at the end of the lease term, we have guaranteed
    a minimum residual value to BNPPLC. Therefore, if the fair value
    of the properties declines below that guaranteed minimum
    residual value, our residual value guarantee would require us to
    pay the difference to BNPPLC, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and
    operating results.

Reductions in headcount growth have resulted in excess capacity
    and vacant facilities. In addition, we may experience changes in
    our operations in the future that could result in additional
    excess capacity and vacant facilities. We will continue to be
    responsible for all carrying costs of these facilities’
    operating leases until such time as we can sublease these
    facilities or terminate the applicable leases based on the
    contractual terms of the operating lease agreements, and these
    costs may have an adverse effect on our business, operating
    results and financial condition.

Risks
    inherent in our international operations could have a material
    adverse effect on our operating results.

We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the
    United States. A substantial portion of our revenues is derived
    from sales outside of the U.S. During fiscal 2009 and 2008,
    our international revenues accounted for 48.5% and 47.1% of our
    total revenues, respectively. In addition, we have several
    research and development centers overseas, and a substantial
    portion of our products are manufactured outside of the
    U.S. Accordingly, our business and our future operating
    results could be materially and adversely affected by a variety
    of factors affecting our international operations, some of which
    are beyond our control, including regulatory, political, or
    economic conditions in a specific country or region, trade
    protection measures and other regulatory requirements,
    government spending patterns, and acts of terrorism and
    international conflicts. In addition, we may not be able to
    maintain or increase international market demand for our
    products.

We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency
    exchange rates as a result of our international operations.
    These exposures may change over time as business practices
    evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our
    financial results and cash flows. Our international sales are
    denominated in U.S. dollars and in foreign currencies. An
    increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to
    foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and
    therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets.
    Conversely, lowering our price in local currency may result in
    lower

U.S.-based

revenue. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar
    relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost of local
    operating expenses. Additionally, we have exposures to emerging
    market currencies, which can have extreme currency volatility.
    We utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our foreign
    currency exposure associated with certain assets and liabilities
    as well as anticipated foreign currency cash flows. All balance
    sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every
    quarter. The time-value component of our cash flow hedges is
    recorded in earnings while all other gains and losses are marked
    to market through other comprehensive income until forecasted
    transactions occur, at which time such realized gains and losses
    are recognized in earnings.



These hedges attempt to reduce, but do not always entirely
    eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements. Factors
    that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging
    program include the accuracy of forecasts and the volatility of
    foreign currency markets as well as widening interest rate
    differentials and the volatility of the foreign exchange market.
    There can be no assurance that such hedging strategies will be
    successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not
    have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

Additional risks inherent in our international business
    activities generally include, among others, longer accounts
    receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing
    international operations. Such factors could materially and
    adversely affect our future international sales and consequently
    our operating results. Our international operations are subject
    to other risks, including general import/export restrictions and
    the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy,
    misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our
    intellectual property rights than U.S. law.

Moreover, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with
    developing economies, it is common to engage in business
    practices that are prohibited by regulations applicable to us,
    such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we implement
    policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these
    laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those
    companies to which we outsource certain of our business
    operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any
    such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could
    subject us to fines and other penalties, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
    results of operations.

We
    have credit exposure to our hedging
    counterparties.

In order to minimize volatility in earnings associated with
    fluctuations in the value of foreign currency relative to the
    U.S. Dollar, we utilize forward and option contracts to
    hedge our exposure to foreign currencies. As a result of
    entering into these hedging contracts with major financial
    institutions, we may be subject to counterparty nonperformance
    risk. Should there be a counterparty default, we could be
    exposed to the net losses on the original hedge contracts or be
    unable to recover anticipated net gains from the transactions.

A
    significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents balances is
    held overseas. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash
    domestically in order to fund our U.S. operations and strategic
    opportunities and service our debt, we may incur a significant
    tax liability in order to repatriate the overseas cash balances,
    or we may need to raise additional capital in the
    future.

A portion of our earnings which is generated from our
    international operations is held and invested by certain of our
    foreign subsidiaries. These amounts are not freely available for
    dividend repatriation to the United States without triggering
    significant adverse tax consequences, which could adversely
    affect our financial results. As a result, unless the cash
    generated by our domestic operations is sufficient to fund our
    domestic operations, our broader corporate initiatives such as
    stock repurchases, acquisitions, and other strategic
    opportunities, and to service our outstanding indebtedness, we
    may need to raise additional funds through public or private
    debt or equity financings, or we may need to expand our existing
    credit facility to the extent we choose not to repatriate our
    overseas cash. Such additional financing may not be available on
    terms favorable to us, or at all, and any new equity financings
    or offerings would dilute our current stockholders’
    ownership. Furthermore, lenders, particularly in light of the
    current challenges in the credit markets, may not agree to
    extend us new, additional or continuing credit. If adequate
    funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable
    terms, we may be forced to repatriate our foreign cash and incur
    a significant tax expense or we may not be able to take
    advantage of strategic opportunities, develop new products,
    respond to competitive pressures or repay our outstanding
    indebtedness. In any such case, our business, operating results
    or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.



Changes
    in our effective tax rate or adverse outcomes resulting from
    examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our
    results.

Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several
    factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:

•

Earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are
    taxed at lower rates as compared to the U.S. statutory tax
    rate;

•

Material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates as
    a result of a shift in the mix of pretax profits and losses by
    tax jurisdiction, our ability to use tax credits, or effective
    tax rates by tax jurisdiction that differ from our estimates;

•

Changing tax laws or related interpretations, accounting
    standards, regulations, and interpretations in multiple tax
    jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as the requirements
    of certain tax rulings;

•

An increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes,
    including certain stock-based compensation expense, write-offs
    of acquired in-process research and development, and impairment
    of goodwill;

•

The tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and
    restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between
    reporting periods;

•

Changes related to our ability to ultimately realize future
    benefits attributed to our deferred tax assets, including those
    related to other-than-temporary impairments;

•

Tax assessments resulting from income tax audits or any related
    tax interest or penalties could significantly affect our income
    tax expense for the period in which the settlements take
    place; and

•

A change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign
    earnings.

We receive significant tax benefits from sales to our

non-U.S. customers.

These benefits are contingent upon existing tax regulations in
    the United States and in the countries in which our
    international operations are located. Future changes in domestic
    or international tax regulations could adversely affect our
    ability to continue to realize these tax benefits. We have not
    provided for United States federal and state income taxes or
    foreign withholding taxes that may result on future remittances
    of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Obama
    administration recently announced several proposals to reform
    United States tax rules, including proposals that may result in
    a reduction or elimination of the deferral of United States
    income tax on our future unrepatriated earnings. Absent a
    restructuring of some legal entities and their functionality,
    some of the future unrepatriated earnings would be taxed at the
    United States federal income tax rate.

Additionally, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
    Circuit on May 27, 2009 held in Xilinx Inc. v.
    Commissioner that stock-based compensation must be included in
    the research and development cost base of companies that have
    entered into a cost sharing arrangement and must, therefore, be
    allocated among the participants based on anticipated benefits.
    The Court’s reversal of the prior U.S. Tax Court
    decision will impact our estimate of tax benefits that were
    required to be recognized under Financial Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (“FIN 48”). We are currently evaluating the
    impact of the Xilinx case on our provision for income taxes for
    the first quarter of fiscal 2010, but expect any final
    adjustment will be limited to a reduction of our unrecognized
    tax attributes.

Our international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling
    concluded in the Netherlands, which expires in 2010. If we are
    unable to negotiate a similar tax ruling upon expiration of the
    current ruling, our effective tax rate could increase and our
    operating results could be adversely affected. Our effective tax
    rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving
    interpretations of existing law or regulations, which in turn
    would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a
    whole. Our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected
    if there is a change in international operations and how the
    operations are managed and structured. The price of our common
    stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are
    materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax
    rate.



We are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the
    United States and several foreign tax jurisdictions. The rights
    to some of our intellectual property (“IP”) are owned
    by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made
    between U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the
    use of this IP in a qualified cost sharing arrangement. In
    recent years, several other U.S. companies have had their
    foreign IP arrangements challenged as part of IRS examinations,
    which has resulted in material proposed assessments

and/or

pending litigation with respect to those companies. During
    fiscal 2009, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustments from
    the IRS in connection with federal income tax audits conducted
    with respect to our fiscal 2003 and 2004 tax years. If the
    ultimate determination of income taxes assessed under the
    current IRS audit or under audits being conducted in any of the
    other tax jurisdictions in which we operate results in an amount
    in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for,
    our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could
    be adversely affected.

We may
    face increased risks and uncertainties related to our current or
    future investments in nonmarketable securities of private
    companies, and these investments may not achieve our
    objectives.

On occasion, we make strategic investments in nonmarketable
    securities of development stage entities. As of April 24,
    2009, the carrying value of our investments in nonmarketable
    securities totaled $4.0 million. Investments in
    nonmarketable securities are inherently risky, and some of these
    companies are likely to fail. Their success (or lack thereof) is
    dependent on product development, market acceptance, operational
    efficiency and other key business success factors. In addition,
    depending on these companies’ future prospects, they may
    not be able to raise additional funds when needed, or they may
    receive lower valuations, with less favorable investment terms
    than in previous financings, and our investments in them would
    likely become impaired. We could lose our entire investment in
    these companies. For example, during fiscal 2009 we determined
    that our investments in nonmarketable securities of two
    companies had been impaired, and we recorded impairment charges
    of $6.3 million.

If we
    are unable to establish fair value for any undelivered element
    of a sales arrangement, all or a portion of the revenue relating
    to the arrangement could be deferred to future
    periods.

In the course of our sales efforts, we often enter into multiple
    element arrangements that include our systems and one or more of
    the following undelivered software-related elements: software
    entitlements and maintenance, premium hardware maintenance, and
    storage review services. If we are required to change the
    pricing of our software related elements through discounting, or
    otherwise introduce variability in the pricing of such elements,
    we may be unable to maintain Vendor Specific Objective Evidence
    of fair value of the undelivered elements of the arrangement,
    and would therefore be required to delay the recognition of all
    or a portion of the related arrangement. A delay in the
    recognition of revenue may cause fluctuations in our financial
    results and may adversely affect our operating margins.

Our
    business could be materially and adversely affected as a result
    of a natural disaster, terrorist acts or other catastrophic
    events.

We depend on the ability of our personnel, raw materials,
    equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the
    world. Any political, military, world health or other issue that
    hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of
    materials could lead to significant business disruptions.
    Furthermore, any strike, economic failure or other material
    disruption caused by fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, power
    shortages, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar
    events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct
    business. If such disruptions result in cancellations of
    customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic
    activity or corporate spending on information technology, or
    directly impact our marketing, manufacturing, financial and
    logistics functions, our results of operations and financial
    condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition,
    our headquarters are located in Northern California, an area
    susceptible to earthquakes. If any significant disaster were to
    occur, our ability to operate our business could be impaired.

We
    depend on attracting and retaining qualified technical and sales
    personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain such
    personnel, our operating results could be materially and
    adversely impacted.

Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to
    identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified technical and
    sales personnel. Because our future success is dependent on our
    ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products, we
    are particularly dependent on our ability to identify, attract,
    motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite
    education, background and industry experience. Competition for
    qualified



engineers, particularly in Silicon Valley, can be intense. The
    loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or
    salespeople could be disruptive to our development efforts or
    business relationships and could materially and adversely affect
    our operating results.

Undetected
    software errors, hardware errors, or failures found in new
    products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of
    our products, which could increase our costs and reduce our
    revenues. Product quality problems could lead to reduced
    revenue, gross margins and operating results.

Our products may contain undetected software errors, hardware
    errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are
    released. Despite testing by us and by current and potential
    customers, errors may not be found in new products until after
    commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of or
    delay in market acceptance, which could materially and adversely
    affect our operating results.

If we fail to remedy a product defect, we may experience a
    failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal
    from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory
    costs or product reengineering expenses, any of which could have
    a material impact on our revenue, gross margins and operating
    results.

In addition, we may be subject to losses that may result from or
    are alleged to result from defects in our products, which could
    subject us to claims for damages, including consequential
    damages. Based on our historical experience, we believe that the
    risk of exposure to product liability claims is low. However,
    should we experience increased exposure to product liability
    claims, our business could be adversely impacted.

We are
    exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims
    and protection of intellectual property rights, which could
    adversely affect our operating results.

We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business,
    including our ongoing litigation with Sun Microsystems.
    Litigation can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal
    business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal
    proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution
    of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on
    our business, operating results, or financial condition.

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may be
    subject to increased competition that could materially and
    adversely affect our operating results. Our success depends
    significantly upon our proprietary technology. We rely on a
    combination of copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets,
    confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and patents
    to protect our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our
    software, documentation and other written materials under trade
    secret, copyright and patent laws, which afford only limited
    protection. Some of our U.S. trademarks are registered
    internationally as well. We will continue to evaluate the
    registration of additional trademarks as appropriate. We
    generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our
    employees and with our resellers, strategic partners and
    customers. We currently have multiple U.S. and
    international patent applications pending and multiple
    U.S. patents issued. The pending applications may not be
    approved, and our existing and future patents may be challenged.
    If such challenges are brought, the patents may be invalidated.
    We may not be able to develop proprietary products or
    technologies that are patentable, or where any issued patent
    will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be
    challenged by third parties. Further, the patents of others may
    materially and adversely affect our ability to do business. In
    addition, a failure to obtain and defend our trademark
    registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and
    competitive position.

Litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary
    technology. Any such litigation may be time consuming and
    costly. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,
    unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products
    or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In
    addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect
    proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the
    United States. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights
    may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop
    similar technology, duplicate our products, or design around
    patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of
    ours.

We are subject to intellectual property infringement claims. We
    may, from time to time, receive claims that we are infringing
    third parties’ intellectual property rights. Third parties
    may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to
    current or future products, patents, trademarks or other
    proprietary rights. We expect that companies in the network
    storage market will increasingly be subject to infringement
    claims as the number of products and



competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality
    of products in different industry segments overlaps. Any such
    claims could be time consuming, result in costly litigation,
    cause product shipment delays, require us to redesign our
    products or enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of
    which could materially and adversely affect our operating
    results. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may
    not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.

We are
    continually seeking ways to make our cost structure more
    efficient, including moving activities from higher- to
    lower-cost owned locations, as well as outsourcing certain
    business process functions. Problems with the execution of these
    changes could have an adverse effect on our business or results
    of operations.

We continuously seek to make our cost structure more efficient.
    We are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and
    scalability, and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging
    our global capabilities, as well as external talent and skills
    worldwide. For example, certain engineering activities and
    projects that were formally performed in the U.S. have been
    moved to lower cost international locations. The challenges
    involved with these initiatives include executing business
    functions in accordance with local laws and other obligations
    while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures.

In addition, we will rely on partners or third party service
    providers for the provision of certain business process
    functions in IT and accounting, and as a result, we may incur
    increased business continuity risks. For example, we may no
    longer be able to exercise control over some aspects of the
    future development, support or maintenance of outsourced
    operations and processes, including the internal controls
    associated with those outsourced business operations and
    processes, which could adversely affect our business. If we are
    unable to effectively utilize or integrate and interoperate with
    external resources or if our partners or third party service
    providers experience business difficulties or are unable to
    provide business process services as anticipated, we may need to
    seek alternative service providers or resume providing these
    business processes internally, which could be costly and time
    consuming and have a material adverse effect on our operating
    results.

Our
    business could be materially adversely affected by changes in
    regulations or standards regarding energy efficiency of our
    products.

We continually seek ways to increase the energy efficiency of
    our products. Recent analyses have estimated the amount of
    global carbon emissions that are due to information technology
    products. As a result, governmental and non-governmental
    organizations have turned their attention to development of
    regulations and standards to drive technological improvements
    and reduce such amount of carbon emissions. There is a risk that
    the rush to development of these standards will not fully
    address the complexity of the technology developed by the IT
    industry or will favor certain technological approaches.
    Depending on the regulations or standards that are ultimately
    adopted, compliance could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition or operating results.

Our
    business is subject to increasingly complex corporate
    governance, public disclosure, accounting and tax requirements
    that have increased both our costs and the risk of
    noncompliance.

Because our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to
    certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial
    market exchange entities charged with the protection of
    investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are
    publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC, and NASDAQ, have
    implemented requirements and regulations and continue developing
    additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate
    scandals and laws enacted by Congress, most notably the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our efforts to comply with these
    regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue
    resulting in, increased general and administrative expenses and
    diversion of management time and attention from
    revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.

We completed our evaluation of our internal controls over
    financial reporting for the fiscal year ended April 24,
    2009 as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
    of 2002. Although our assessment, testing and evaluation
    resulted in our conclusion that as of April 24, 2009, our
    internal controls over financial reporting were effective, we
    cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods. If
    our internal controls are ineffective in future periods, our
    business and reputation could be harmed. We may incur additional
    expenses and commitment of



management’s time in connection with further evaluations,
    either of which could materially increase our operating expenses
    and accordingly reduce our operating results.

Because new and modified laws, regulations, and standards are
    subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their
    lack of specificity, their application in practice may evolve
    over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and
    governing bodies. This evolution may result in continuing
    uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs
    necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and
    governance practices.

Changes
    in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected
    fluctuations and affect our reported results of
    operations.

A change in accounting standards or practices and varying
    interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements, such as
    the increased use of fair value measures and the potential
    requirement that U.S. registrants prepare financial
    statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
    Standards (IFRS), could have a significant effect on our
    reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.

Properties

Our headquarters site for corporate general administration,
    sales and marketing, research and development, global services,
    and operations is located in Sunnyvale, California. We own
    approximately 933,484 square feet of facilities at our
    Sunnyvale headquarters, of which we occupy approximately
    737,157 square feet. In addition, we own
    646,123 square feet of facilities in Research Triangle Park
    (RTP) , North Carolina, of which we occupy approximately
    490,131 square feet, that is being used for research and
    development, and global support.

In addition, we have commitments related to various lease
    arrangements with BNP Paribas LLC (“BNP”) for
    approximately 559,002 square feet of facilities at our
    headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, of which we occupy
    approximately 274,398 square feet (as further described
    below under “Contractual Cash Obligations and Other
    Commercial Commitments” in Item 7 and Note 15
    under Item 8).

We lease other sales offices and research and development
    facilities throughout the U.S. and internationally. We
    expect that our existing facilities and those being developed in
    Sunnyvale, California; RTP, North Carolina; and worldwide are
    adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years
    and that additional space will be available as needed.

See additional discussion regarding properties in
    “Note 15 under Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements” and “Item 7. Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

On September 5, 2007, we filed a patent infringement
    lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory
    damages and a permanent injunction against Sun Microsystems. On
    October 25, 2007, Sun Microsystems filed a counter
    claim against us in the Eastern District of Texas seeking
    compensatory damages and a permanent injunction. On
    October 29, 2007, Sun filed a second lawsuit against us in
    the Northern District of California asserting additional patents
    against us. The Texas court granted a joint motion to transfer
    the Texas lawsuit to the Northern District of California on
    November 26, 2007. On March 26, 2008, Sun filed a
    third lawsuit in federal court that extends the patent
    infringement charges to storage management technology we
    acquired in January 2008. The three lawsuits are currently in
    the discovery phase and no trial date has been set, so we are
    unable at this time to determine the likely outcome of these
    various patent litigations. Since we are unable to reasonably
    estimate the amount or range of any potential settlement, no
    accrual has been recorded as of April 24, 2009.

In April 2009, we entered into a settlement agreement with the
    United States of America, acting through the United States
    Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and on behalf of the
    General Services Administration (the “GSA”), under
    which we agreed to pay the United States $128.0 million,
    plus interest of $0.7 million, related to a dispute
    regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price
    reduction clause provisions of GSA contracts between August 1997
    and February 2005 in consideration for the release of NetApp by
    the DOJ and GSA with



respect to the claims alleged in the investigation as set forth
    in the settlement agreement. The agreement reflects neither an
    admission nor denial by us of any of the claims alleged by the
    DOJ and represents a compromise to avoid continued litigation
    and associated risks. We made the settlement payment on
    April 27, 2009. We are currently in discussions with the
    U.S. government to demonstrate that we have implemented
    processes and procedures to ensure that we comply with federal
    contracting rules.

On June 12, 2009, a purported class action lawsuit was
    filed on behalf of Data Domain stockholders in the Court of
    Chancery of the State of Delaware. The complaint names as
    defendants the Data Domain directors, and NetApp and its merger
    subs. The lawsuit alleges breach of fiduciary duty by the Data
    Domain board and aiding and abetting that breach by NetApp. The
    complaint seeks injunctive relief and damages. We believe that
    the claims against it are without merit.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion of our financial condition and results
    of operations should be read together with the financial
    statements and the related notes set forth under
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data”. The following discussion also contains trend
    information and other forward looking statements that involve a
    number of risks and uncertainties. The Risk Factors set forth in
    “Item 1. Business” are hereby incorporated into
    the discussion by reference.

Overview

Fiscal 2009 was characterized initially by a slowdown in the
    macroeconomic environment with continued deterioration in global
    economic conditions as the year progressed. Customers were faced
    with data volumes that continued to grow and shrinking or frozen
    capital budgets. As a result, customers postponed many IT
    projects and looked for solutions that provided a rapid return
    on their investment — typically less than twelve
    months. Server virtualization remained one of the most often
    funded IT projects, due to the cost savings it produces. NetApp
    has been a direct beneficiary of the trend towards server
    virtualization because of the unique storage efficiency features



we provide along with our ability to virtualize the storage
    infrastructure. With our software intensive solutions, we offer
    customers greater functionality, easier manageability and a
    smaller hardware footprint, helping them to meet their business
    objectives with less physical storage and a lower total cost of
    ownership. As a result, NetApp gained a significant number of
    new customer accounts in fiscal 2009.

However, revenue from new accounts was not enough to offset the
    slowdown in spending from many of our largest accounts, and our
    overall revenue growth slowed relative to previous years. Our
    largest accounts contributed to a significant level of hardware
    service contract and software entitlement and maintenance
    contract renewals, demonstrating continued commitment to NetApp
    technology in their data centers while at the same time delaying
    capital expenditures amidst an uncertain economic environment.

Net revenues increased by 3.1% to $3,406.4 million in
    fiscal 2009, from $3,303.2 million in fiscal 2008. The
    increase in our net revenues for fiscal 2009 was due to
    increases in software entitlements and maintenance revenues as
    well as service revenues, partially offset by decreases in
    product revenues and a negative impact from a GSA settlement.
    The $128.7 million GSA settlement was related to a dispute
    regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price
    reduction clause provisions of a GSA contract between August
    1997 and February 2005.

NetApp implemented comprehensive expense reduction programs in
    fiscal 2009 as the global macroeconomic conditions worsened. We
    decided to cease development and availability of our
    SnapMirror

®

for Open Systems (“SMOS”) product. We also implemented
    a worldwide restructuring program which included a reduction in
    workforce, the closing or downsizing of certain facilities, and
    the establishment of a plan to outsource certain internal
    activities. As a result of these programs, we recognized total
    restructuring charges of $51.5 million, including the
    severance costs related to the elimination of approximately 450
    regular positions, contract cancellation charges, write offs of
    intangible and fixed assets and costs association with the
    closure of some of our facilities; as well as $2.9 million
    of other charges to support our restructuring initiatives. Our
    actions were intended to better align our cost structure with
    expected revenues, as well as to reallocate resources into areas
    of our business with more growth potential.

As a result of the financial crisis during fiscal 2009, we
    recorded an

other-than-temporary

impairment charge of $29.6 million on our investments which
    resulted from direct and indirect exposure to Lehman Brothers
    Holdings Inc. securities and

other-than-temporary

declines in the value of our auction rate securities and
    investments in privately held companies. The volatility in the
    financial markets and economic uncertainty has had and may
    continue to have an adverse impact on our business and financial
    condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.

Despite the current challenging economic environment, we believe
    there are fundamental aspects of our business that will allow us
    to succeed over the long term. We believe that our products and
    services provide customers with valuable storage solutions, even
    in a more constrained spending environment. We also believe that
    our investments in branding, awareness and new customer
    acquisition will lead to an increase in our market share once
    the economy begins to recover. However, continued revenue growth
    depends on the introduction and market acceptance of new
    products and solutions and continued market demand for our
    products. We will continue our focus on expense management while
    improving our resource allocation to fund investment in
    strategic initiatives. Our actions are designed to preserve our
    revenue-generating potential, increase our focus on key growth
    opportunities, and at the same time improve operating leverage
    over the long term.

Subsequent
    Event

On May 20, 2009, we entered into an agreement to acquire
    Data Domain, a leading provider of storage solutions for backup
    and archive applications based on deduplication technology. Data
    Domain deduplication storage systems are designed to deliver
    reliable, efficient and cost-effective solutions that enable
    enterprises of all sizes to manage, retain and protect their
    data. The agreement was subsequently amended on June 3,
    2009. Pursuant to the terms of the definitive merger agreement
    relating to the merger, each share of Data Domain common stock
    issued and outstanding immediately prior to the completion of
    merger will be cancelled and converted into the right to
    receive, subject to adjustment, a combination of $16.45 in cash
    and a certain number of shares of our common stock, calculated
    based on an exchange ratio.



The merger, if completed, may result in material but
    indeterminable increases in our revenues, operating results,
    financial position and cash flows. While we anticipate cost
    synergies associated with combining facilities, IT
    infrastructure, and certain functions such as finance, human
    resources and administrative services with those of Data Domain,
    differences between our and Data Domain’s operations could
    cause unforeseen delays in the integration process, result in
    lower savings than originally anticipated, or both, which could
    adversely affect NetApp’s business and operating results.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates and Policies

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
    of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
    statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. The preparation of such statements requires us to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the
    financial statements. Our estimates are based on historical
    experience and other assumptions that we consider to be
    appropriate in the circumstances. However, actual future results
    may vary from our estimates.

We believe that the following accounting policies are
    “critical” as defined by the Securities and Exchange
    Commission, in that they are both highly important to the
    portrayal of our financial condition and results and require
    difficult management judgments and assumptions about matters
    that are inherently uncertain. We also have other important
    policies, including those related to derivative instruments and
    concentration of credit risk. However, these policies do not
    meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they
    do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that
    are difficult or subjective. These policies are discussed in
    Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements
    accompanying this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We believe the accounting policies described below are the ones
    that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments
    and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results
    of operations:

•

Revenue recognition and allowances

•

Valuation of goodwill and intangibles

•

Accounting for income taxes

•

Inventory write-downs

•

Restructuring accruals

•

Impairment losses on investments

•

Fair value measurements

•

Accounting for stock-based compensation

•

Loss contingencies

Revenue
    Recognition and Allowances

We apply the provisions of Statement of Position
    (“SOP”)

No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

(SOP No. 97-2),

and related interpretations to our product sales, both hardware
    and software, because our software is essential to the
    performance of our hardware. We recognize revenue when:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists:

It is our customary practice to have a
    purchase order

and/or

contract prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement from our
    end users, customers, value-added resellers, or distributors.

•

Delivery has occurred:

Our product is
    physically delivered to our customers, generally with standard
    transfer terms such as FOB origin. We typically do not allow for
    restocking rights with any of our value-added resellers or
    distributors. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or
    return rights are not recognized



as revenue until all criteria are achieved. If undelivered
    products or services exist that are essential to the
    functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement,
    delivery is not considered to have occurred.

•

The fee is fixed or determinable:

Arrangements
    with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms,
    conditions and practices are not considered to be fixed or
    determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized as
    the fees become due and payable. We typically do not allow for
    price-protection rights with any of our value-added resellers or
    distributors.

•

Collection is probable:

Probability of
    collection is assessed on a

customer-by-customer

basis. Customers are subjected to a credit review process that
    evaluates the customers’ financial position and ultimately
    their ability to pay. If it is determined at the outset of an
    arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our
    review process, revenue is recognized upon cash receipt.

Our multiple element arrangements include our systems and one or
    more of the following undelivered software-related elements:
    software entitlements and maintenance, premium hardware
    maintenance, and storage review services. Our software
    entitlements and maintenance entitle our customers to receive
    unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a

when-and-if-available

basis, bug fixes, and patch releases. Premium hardware
    maintenance services include contracts for technical support and
    minimum response times. Revenues from software entitlements and
    maintenance, premium hardware maintenance services and storage
    review services are recognized ratably over the contractual
    term, generally from one to three years. We also offer extended
    service contracts (which extend our standard parts warranty and
    may include premium hardware maintenance) at the end of the
    warranty term; revenues from these contracts are recognized
    ratably over the contract term. We typically sell technical
    consulting services separately from any of our other revenue
    elements, either on a time and materials basis or for fixed
    price standard projects; we recognize revenue for these services
    as they are performed. Revenue from hardware installation
    services is recognized at the time of delivery and any remaining
    costs are accrued, as the remaining undelivered services are
    considered to be inconsequential and perfunctory. For
    arrangements with multiple elements, we recognize as revenue the
    difference between the total arrangement price and the greater
    of fair value or stated price for any undelivered elements
    (“the residual method”).

For our undelivered software-related elements, we apply the
    provisions of

SOP No. 97-2

and determine fair value of these undelivered elements based on
    vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”), which for
    us consists of the prices charged when these services are sold
    separately either alone, in the case of software entitlements
    and maintenance, or as a bundled element which always includes
    software entitlements and maintenance and premium hardware
    maintenance, and may also include storage review services. To
    determine the fair value of these elements, we analyze both the
    selling prices when elements are sold separately as well as the
    concentrations of those prices. We believe those concentrations
    have been sufficient to enable us to establish VSOE of fair
    value for the undelivered elements. If VSOE cannot be obtained
    to establish fair value of the undelivered elements,
    paragraph 12 of

SOP No. 97-2

would require that revenue from the entire arrangement be
    initially deferred and recognized ratably over the period these
    elements are delivered.

For income statement presentation purposes, once fair value has
    been determined for our undelivered bundled elements, we
    allocate revenue first to software entitlements and maintenance,
    based on VSOE of its fair value with the remainder allocated to
    other service revenues.

We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at
    the time of shipment. Sales returns are estimated based on
    historical sales returns, current trends, and our expectations
    regarding future experience. We monitor and analyze the accuracy
    of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and
    adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of
    our current and future reserve needs. Our reserve levels have
    been sufficient to cover actual returns and have not required
    material changes in subsequent periods. While we currently have
    no expectations for significant changes to these reserves, if
    actual future returns and allowances differ from past
    experience, additional allowances may be required.

We also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for
    estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility
    of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts
    receivable. We analyze accounts receivable and historical bad
    debts, customer concentrations, customer solvency, current
    economic and geographic trends, and changes in customer payment
    terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of our current
    and



future allowance. In circumstances where we are aware of a
    specific customer’s inability to meet its financial
    obligations to us, a specific allowance for bad debt is
    estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable
    to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected.
    We monitor and analyze the accuracy of allowance for doubtful
    accounts estimate by reviewing past collectibility and adjust it
    for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current
    and future allowance. Our reserve levels have generally been
    sufficient to cover credit losses. Our allowance for doubtful
    accounts as of April 24, 2009 was $3.1 million,
    compared to $2.4 million as of April 25, 2008. If the
    financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate,
    resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments,
    additional allowances may be required.

Valuation
    of Goodwill and Intangibles

Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over time, while
    in-process research and development is recorded as a charge on
    the date of acquisition and goodwill is capitalized, subject to
    periodic review for impairment. Accordingly, the allocation of
    the acquisition cost to identifiable intangible assets has a
    significant impact on our future operating results. The
    allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and
    assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows expected
    to be generated by the acquired assets. Should conditions be
    different than management’s current assessment, material
    write-downs of the fair value of intangible assets may be
    required. We periodically review the estimated remaining useful
    lives of our intangible assets. A reduction in the estimate of
    remaining useful life could result in accelerated amortization
    expense or a write-down in future periods. As such, any future
    write-downs of these assets would adversely affect our operating
    results.

Under our accounting policy we perform an annual review of the
    valuation of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year,
    or more often if indicators of impairment exist. Triggering
    events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse
    industry or economic trends, restructuring actions, lower
    projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in our
    market capitalization. Evaluations of possible impairment and,
    if applicable, adjustments to carrying values require us to
    estimate, among other factors, future cash flows, useful lives,
    and fair market values of our reporting units and assets. When
    we conduct our evaluation of goodwill, the fair value of
    goodwill is assessed using valuation techniques that require
    significant management judgment. Should conditions be different
    from management’s last assessment, significant write-downs
    of goodwill may be required, which would adversely affect our
    operating results. In fiscal 2009 we performed such evaluation
    and found no impairment of goodwill. As of April 24, 2009,
    our assets included $681.0 million in goodwill. See
    Note 12, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible
    Assets,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In fiscal 2009, we increased goodwill by $0.9 million
    relating to the tax benefits associated with the subsequent
    exercise of previously vested assumed Spinnaker and Onaro
    options. During fiscal 2008, we recorded goodwill of
    $79.2 million in connection with our Onaro acquisition and
    a decrease of goodwill for $0.2 million in connection with
    the escrow received from our Topio acquisition in fiscal 2007.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

The determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments
    and estimates due to the complexity of the tax law that we are
    subject to in several tax jurisdictions. Earnings derived from
    our international business are generally taxed at rates that are
    lower than U.S. rates, resulting in a lower effective tax
    rate than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0%. The ability
    to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent on
    existing tax laws in both the United States and the respective
    countries in which our international subsidiaries are located.
    Future changes in domestic or international tax laws could
    affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are
    currently receiving. In addition, a decrease in the percentage
    of our total earnings from international business or a change in
    the mix of international business among particular tax
    jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate.

We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 109,
    “

Accounting for Income Taxes.

”
    SFAS No. 109 requires that deferred tax assets and
    liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
    used for income tax purposes. SFAS No. 109 also
    requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation
    allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the
    deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have provided a
    valuation allowance of $28.0 million as of April 24,
    2009,



compared to $28.6 million as of April 25, 2008 on
    certain of our deferred tax assets. The $0.5 million
    decrease in valuation allowance in fiscal 2009 was primarily
    related to changes in the blended state tax rates. Tax
    attributes related to the exercise of employee stock options are
    not realized until they result in a reduction of taxes payable.
    Pursuant to SFAS No. 123R, we do not include
    unrealized stock option attributes as components of our gross
    deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance
    disclosures. The tax effected amounts of gross unrealized net
    operating loss and business tax credit carryforwards, and their
    corresponding valuation allowance at April 24, 2009 and
    April 25, 2008 are $278.9 million and
    $245.1 million, respectively.

On April 28, 2007, we adopted Financial Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (“FIN 48”). FIN No. 48 clarifies the
    accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
    enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109. This interpretation prescribes a
    recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
    financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. As a
    result of the implementation of FIN No. 48, we
    recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions
    on the income tax return based on the two-step process
    prescribed in the interpretation. The first step is to determine
    whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position
    would be sustained upon audit. The second step is to estimate
    and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater
    than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement
    with the tax authority. Estimating these amounts requires us to
    determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We
    evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis.
    This evaluation is based on the consideration of several
    factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in
    applicable tax law, settlement of issues under audit, and new
    exposures. If we later determine that our exposure is lower or
    that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised
    expectations, we adjust the liability and effect a related
    change in our tax provision during the period in which we make
    such determination.

We are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the
    United States and several foreign tax jurisdictions. The rights
    to some of our intellectual property (“IP”) are owned
    by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made
    between foreign and U.S. tax jurisdictions relating to the
    use of this IP in a qualified cost sharing arrangement.
    Recently, several other U.S. companies have had their
    foreign IP arrangements challenged as part of IRS examinations,
    which have resulted in material proposed assessments

and/or

pending litigation. Effective September 27, 2007, the
    IRS’s Large and Mid-Sized Business Division
    (“LMSB”) released a Coordinated Issues Paper
    (“CIP”) with respect to qualified cost sharing
    arrangements (“CSAs”). Specifically, this CIP provides
    guidance to IRS personnel concerning methods that may be applied
    to evaluate the arm’s length charge (buy-in payment) for
    internally developed (pre-existing) as well as
    acquisition-related intangible property that is made available
    to a qualified CSA. During fiscal year 2009 we received Notices
    of Proposed Adjustments from the IRS in connection with a
    federal income tax audit of our fiscal 2003 and 2004 tax year
    tax returns. We recently filed a protest with the IRS in
    response to the Notices of Proposed Adjustments. The Notices of
    Proposed Adjustments focus primarily on issues of the timing and
    the amount of income recognized and deductions taken during the
    audit years and on the level of cost allocations made to foreign
    operations during the audit years. If upon the conclusion of
    these audits the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any
    of these tax jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax
    provision we have recorded in the applicable period or
    subsequently reserved for, our overall tax expense and effective
    tax rate may be adversely impacted in the period of adjustment.

Effective March 20, 2008, the IRS’s LMSB also released
    a CIP with respect to the cost sharing of stock based
    compensation. Specifically, this CIP provides guidance to IRS
    personnel concerning stock based compensation related to a CSA
    by providing that the parties to a CSA will share all costs
    related to intangible development of the covered intangibles,
    including but not limited to, salaries, bonuses, and other
    payroll costs and benefits. Taxpayers should include all forms
    of compensation in the cost pool, including those costs related
    to stock-based compensation. On May 27, 2009, the United
    States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held in Xilinx
    Inc. v. Commissioner that stock-based compensation must be
    included in the research and development cost base of companies
    that have entered into a CSA and must, therefore, be allocated
    among the participants based on anticipated benefits. The
    Court’s reversal of the prior U.S. Tax Court decision
    will impact our estimate of tax benefits that were required to
    be recognized under FIN 48. We are evaluating the impact of
    the Xilinx case on our provision for income taxes for the first
    quarter of fiscal 2010, but expect any final adjustment will be
    limited to a reduction of our unrecognized tax attributes. Our
    international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling



concluded in the Netherlands, which expires in 2010. If we are
    unable to negotiate a similar tax ruling upon expiration of the
    current ruling, our effective tax rate could increase and our
    operating results could be adversely affected. Our effective tax
    rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving
    interpretations of existing law or regulations, which in turn
    would negatively impact our operating and financial results.

The Obama administration recently announced several proposals to
    reform United States tax rules, including proposals that may
    result in a reduction or elimination of the deferral of United
    States income tax on our future unrepatriated earnings. Absent a
    restructuring of some legal entities and their functionality,
    the changes as currently proposed would result in some of the
    future unrepatriated earnings being taxed at the United States
    federal income tax rate.

Inventory
    Write-Downs

Our inventory balance was $61.1 million as of
    April 24, 2009, compared to $70.2 million as of
    April 25, 2008. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
    or market (which approximates actual cost on a

first-in,

first-out basis). We perform an in-depth excess and obsolete
    analysis of our inventory based upon assumptions about future
    demand and market conditions. We adjust the inventory value
    based on estimated excess and obsolete inventories determined
    primarily by future demand forecasts. Although we strive for
    accuracy in our forecasts of future product demand, any
    significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological
    developments could have a significant impact on the value of our
    inventory and commitments and on our reported results. If actual
    market conditions are less favorable than those projected,
    additional write-downs and other charges against earnings may be
    required. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may
    realize higher gross margins in the period when the written-down
    inventory is sold. During the past few years, our inventory
    reserves have been sufficient to cover excess and obsolete
    exposure and have not required material changes in subsequent
    periods.

We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and
    foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage,
    discharge, and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in the
    manufacture of our products, which may require design changes or
    recycling of products we manufacture. We will continue to
    monitor our compliance with these regulations, which may require
    us to incur higher costs, and adversely impact our operating
    results.

Restructuring
    Accruals

In fiscal 2009 we recorded restructuring and other charges of
    $54.4 million. We recognize a liability for restructuring
    costs when the liability is incurred. The restructuring accruals
    are based upon management estimates at the time they are
    recorded. These estimates can change depending upon changes in
    facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original
    liability was recorded. The main components of our restructuring
    charges are workforce reduction, intangibles and fixed assets
    write-offs and non-cancelable lease costs related to excess
    facilities. Severance-related charges are accrued when it is
    determined that a liability has been incurred, which is
    generally when individuals have been notified of their
    termination dates and expected severance payments. We record
    contract cancellation costs when contracts are terminated. The
    decision to eliminate excess facilities results in charges for
    lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease
    charges, net of estimated future sublease income. We recognize
    charges for elimination of excess facilities when we have
    vacated the premises. Intangible asset write-offs consist of
    impairment of acquired intangible assets related to our decision
    to cease the development and availability of SMOS. Fixed assets
    write-offs primarily consist of equipment and furniture
    associated with excess facilities being eliminated, and are
    based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash
    flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate
    sale or disposal of the equipment and furniture.

Our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some
    of which are beyond our control, including future real estate
    market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into
    subleases or lease termination agreements with terms as
    favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates. We
    regularly evaluate a number of factors to determine the
    appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring
    accruals, including the various assumptions noted above. If
    actual results differ significantly from our estimates, we may
    be required to adjust our restructuring accruals in the future.



Impairment
    Losses on Investments

All of our

available-for-sale

investments and nonmarketable securities are subject to periodic
    impairment review. Investments are considered to be impaired
    when a decline in fair value is judged to be

other-than-temporary.

This determination requires significant judgment. For publicly
    traded investments, impairment is determined based upon the
    specific facts and circumstances present at the time, including
    factors such as current economic and market conditions, the
    credit rating of the security’s issuer, the length of time
    an investment’s fair value has been below our carrying
    value, our ability and intent to hold investments to maturity or
    for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
    recovery in fair value. If an investment’s decline in fair
    value, caused by factors other than changes in interest rates,
    is deemed to be

other-than-temporary,

we reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value, as
    determined based on quoted market prices, liquidation values or
    other metrics. For investments in publicly held companies, we
    recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair
    value of our investment is below its cost basis and is judged to
    be

other-than-temporary.

The ultimate value realized on these investments in publicly
    held companies is subject to market price volatility until they
    are sold.

We actively review, along with our investment advisors, current
    investment ratings, company specific events, and general
    economic conditions in managing our investments and determining
    whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is

other-than-temporary.

As of April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, our
    short-term and long-term investments in marketable securities
    have been classified as

“available-for-sale”

and are carried at fair value.

Available-for-sale

investments with original maturities of greater than three
    months at the date of purchases are classified as short-term
    investments as these investments generally consist of marketable
    securities that are intended to be available to meet current
    cash requirements. Currently, all marketable securities held by
    us are classified as

available-for-sale

and our entire auction rate securities (ARS) portfolio and our
    investment in the Reserve Primary Fund (“Primary
    Fund”) are classified as long-term investments.

Our ARS are securities with long-term nominal maturities which,
    in accordance with investment policy guidelines, had credit
    ratings of AAA and Aaa at the time of purchase. During the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we reclassified all of our
    investments in ARS from short-term investments to long-term
    investments as we believed our ability to liquidate these
    investments in the next twelve months was uncertain. Based on an
    analysis of the fair value and marketability of these
    investments, we recorded temporary impairment charges of
    approximately $7.0 million during fiscal 2009, partially
    offset by $0.3 million in unrealized gains within other
    comprehensive income (loss). During fiscal 2009, we recorded an

other-than-temporary

impairment loss of $2.1 million due to a significant
    decline in the estimated fair values of certain of our ARS
    related to credit quality risk and rating downgrades.

During fiscal 2008 and 2007, recognized gains and losses on

available-for-sale

investments were not material. Management determines the
    appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the
    time of purchase and reevaluates the classification at each
    reporting date. The fair value of our marketable securities,
    including those included in long-term investments, was
    $1,228,220 and $543,226 as of April 24, 2009 and
    April 25, 2008, respectively.

The valuation models used to estimate the fair value of our ARS
    included numerous assumptions such as assessments of the
    underlying structure of each security, expected cash flows,
    discount rates, credit ratings, workout periods, and overall
    capital market liquidity. These assumptions, assessments and the
    interpretations of relevant market data are subject to
    uncertainties, are difficult to predict and require significant
    judgment. The use of different assumptions, applying different
    judgments to inherently subjective matters and changes in future
    market conditions could result in significantly different
    estimates of fair value. There is no assurance as to when the
    market for auction rate securities will stabilize. The fair
    value of our ARS could change significantly based on market
    conditions and continued uncertainties in the credit markets. If
    these uncertainties continue or if these securities experience
    credit rating downgrades, we may incur additional temporary
    impairment related to our auction rate securities portfolio. We
    will continue to monitor the fair value of our ARS and relevant
    market conditions and will record additional temporary or

other-than-temporary

impairments if future circumstances warrant such charges.

As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers, which
    occurred during fiscal 2009, we recorded an

other-than-temporary

impairment charge of $11.8 million on our corporate bonds
    related to investments in Lehman Brothers securities and
    approximately $9.3 million on our investments in the
    Primary Fund that held Lehman Brothers investments. As of
    April 24, 2009, we have an investment in the Primary Fund,
    an AAA-rated money market fund at the time of purchase, with a
    par value of $60.9 million and an estimated fair value of
    $51.6 million, which suspended redemptions in September
    2008 and is in the process of liquidating its portfolio of



investments. The Primary Fund suspended redemptions in September
    2008, and on December 3, 2008, it announced a plan for
    liquidation and distribution of assets that includes the
    establishment of a special reserve to be set aside out of its
    assets for pending or threatened claims, as well as anticipated
    costs and expenses, including related legal and accounting fees.
    On February 26, 2009, the Primary Fund announced a plan to
    set aside $3.5 billion of the fund’s remaining assets
    as the “special reserve” which may be increased or
    decreased as further information becomes available. Our pro rata
    share of the $3.5 billion special reserve is approximately
    $41.5 million. The Primary Fund announced plans to continue
    to make periodic distributions, up to the amount of the special
    reserve, on a pro-rata basis. The Primary Fund has received an
    SEC order providing that the SEC will supervise the distribution
    of assets from the Primary Fund. We could realize additional
    losses in our holdings of the Primary Fund and may not receive
    all or a portion of our remaining balance in the Primary Fund as
    a result of market conditions and ongoing litigation against the
    fund

To determine the fair value of nonmarketable investments, we use
    the most recent information available to us, including new
    financings or estimates of current fair value, as well as
    through traditional valuation techniques. It is our policy to
    review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to
    determine whether the investments in these companies are

other-than-temporarily

impaired. In the case of privately-held companies, this
    evaluation is based on information that we request from these
    companies. This evaluation includes, but is not limited to,
    reviewing company cash position, financing needs and prospects,
    earnings or revenue outlook, operational performance, management
    or ownership changes and competition. This information is not
    subject to the same disclosure regulations as United States
    publicly-traded companies, and as such, the basis for these
    evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the
    data received from these companies. If we believe the carrying
    value of an investment is in excess of fair value, and this
    difference is

other-than-temporary,

it is our policy to write down the investment to fair value. The
    carrying value of our investments in privately-held companies
    were $4.0 million and $11.2 million as of
    April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, respectively.
    During fiscal 2009 and 2008, we recorded $6.3 million and
    $1.6 million of impairment charges, respectively, for our
    investments in privately-held companies, which were recorded in
    net gain (loss) on investments in our consolidated statements of
    operations, and adjusted the carrying amount of those
    investments to fair value, as we deemed the decline in the value
    of these assets to be

other-than-temporary.

Fair
    Value Measurements

We adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 157, “

Fair Value
    Measurements,

” effective April 26, 2008 for
    financial assets and liabilities that are being measured and
    reported at fair value on a recurring basis. Under this
    standard, fair value is defined as the price that would be
    received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e.,
    the “exit price”) in an orderly transaction between
    market participants at the measurement date.
    SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy for inputs used
    in measuring fair value that minimizes the use of unobservable
    inputs by requiring the use of observable market data when
    available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants
    would use in pricing the asset or liability based on active
    market data. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the
    assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset
    or liability based on the best information available in the
    circumstances.

The fair value hierarchy is broken down into the three input
    levels summarized below:

•

Level 1 — Valuations are based on quoted prices
    in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, and
    readily accessible by us at the reporting date. Examples of
    assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs are certain
    money market funds, U.S. Treasury notes and trading
    securities with quoted prices on active markets.

•

Level 2 — Valuations based on inputs other than
    the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either
    directly or indirectly in active markets. Examples of assets and
    liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs are
    U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, corporate
    securities, certificates of deposit, and

over-the-counter

derivatives.

•

Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs
    in which there is little or no market data, which require us to
    develop our own assumptions. Examples of assets and liabilities
    utilizing Level 3 inputs are cost method investments, ARS,
    and the Primary Fund.

We measure our

available-for-sale

securities at fair value on a recurring basis.

Available-for-sale

securities include U.S. Treasury securities,
    U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, corporate
    securities, auction rate



securities money market funds and certificates of deposit. Where
    possible, we utilize quoted market prices to measure and such
    items are classified as Level 1 in the hierarchy. When
    quoted market prices for identical assets are unavailable,
    varying valuation techniques are used. Such assets are
    classified as Level 2 or Level 3 in the hierarchy. We
    classify items in Level 2 if the investments are valued
    using observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark
    yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative
    pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. We
    classify items in Level 3 if the investments are valued
    using a pricing model, based on unobservable inputs in the
    market or require us to develop our own assumptions. Our
    assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair
    value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and
    considers factors specific to the investment.

We evaluate our investments for

other-than-temporary

impairment in accordance with guidance provided by
    SFAS No. 115,

“Accounting for Certain
    Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”

and related
    guidance. We consider and review factors such as the length of
    time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis,
    the significance of the loss incurred, the financial condition
    and credit rating of the issuer and insurance guarantor, the
    length of time the investments have been illiquid, and our
    ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time
    which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value.

We are also exposed to market risk relating to our

available-for-sale

investments due to uncertainties in the credit and capital
    markets. As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman
    Brothers, we recorded an

other-than-temporary

impairment charge of $21.1 million in fiscal 2009 related
    to Lehman Brothers corporate bonds and the Primary Fund that
    held Lehman Brothers investments, as well as an

other-than-temporary

impairment charge of $2.1 million related to the value of
    our ARS. The fair value of our investments may change
    significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and
    capital markets. These securities/issuers could be subject to
    review for possible downgrade. Any downgrade in these credit
    ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated
    fair value of our investments. We will continue to monitor and
    evaluate the accounting for our investment portfolio on a
    quarterly basis for additional

other-than-temporary

impairment charges. We could realize additional losses in our
    holdings of the Primary Fund and may not receive all or a
    portion of our remaining balance in the Primary Fund as a result
    of market conditions and ongoing litigation against the fund.

Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123R, “

Share-Based Payment

,”
    using the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our
    employee stock options. The fair value of each option grant is
    estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. Option pricing models require the input of highly
    subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
    volatility, expected life, and forfeiture rate. Any changes in
    these highly subjective assumptions may significantly impact the
    stock-based compensation expense for the future.

Loss
    Contingencies

We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies
    arising in the course of business. We consider the likelihood of
    the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a
    liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the
    amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated
    loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability
    has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount
    of loss can be reasonably estimated. In April 2009, we entered
    into a settlement agreement with the United States of America,
    acting through the United States Department of Justice
    (“DOJ”) and on behalf of the General Services
    Administration (the “GSA”), under which we agreed to
    pay the United States $128.0 million, plus interest of
    $0.7 million, related to a dispute regarding our discount
    practices and compliance with the price reduction clause
    provisions of GSA contracts between August 1997 and February
    2005 in consideration for the release of NetApp by the DOJ and
    GSA with respect to the claims alleged in the investigation as
    set forth in the settlement agreement. The agreement reflects
    neither an admission nor denial by NetApp of any of the claims
    alleged by the DOJ and represents a compromise to avoid
    continued litigation and associated risks. NetApp made the
    settlement payment on April 27, 2009. In fiscal 2008 and
    2007, we did not identify or accrue for any loss contingencies.
    We regularly evaluate current information available to us to
    determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.

Net revenues increased by 3.1% to $3,406.4 million in
    fiscal 2009, from $3,303.2 million in fiscal 2008. The
    increase in our net revenues for fiscal 2009 was due to
    increases in software entitlements and maintenance revenues as
    well as service revenues, partially offset by decreases in
    product revenues, and the negative impact from the GSA
    settlement.

Net revenues increased by 17.8% to $3,303.2 million in
    fiscal 2008, from $2,804.3 million in fiscal 2007. Our
    fiscal 2008 revenue growth was attributable to increased product
    revenues, software entitlements and maintenance revenues, and
    service.

Sales through our indirect channels represented 69.0%, 63.0% and
    59.6% of net revenues for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

During fiscal 2009, two U.S. distributors accounted for
    approximately 10.5% and 10.6% of our net revenues, respectively.
    No distributor or other customer accounted for ten percent or
    more of our net revenues during fiscal 2008 and 2007.

Product revenues decreased by $89.8 million, or 4.0% in
    fiscal 2009, compared to fiscal 2008. Unit volume increased,
    driven by smaller, low end systems, partially offset by
    decreases in mid-range and high end systems. This trend is
    consistent with a shift in customer buying patterns towards
    smaller systems, due to IT spending constraints and difficult
    economic conditions. In addition, average selling prices
    declined, driven by lower list prices, unfavorable configuration
    mix (consisting of hardware and software components, disk
    capacity and disk price) and higher discounting, as well as
    unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes during fiscal 2009.
    Partially offsetting these factors was an increase in revenues
    from add-on products, as customers focused more on extending the
    useful lives and capacity of their existing storage solutions.

Product revenues increased by $156.6 million or 7.5% to
    $2,242.5 million in fiscal 2008, from $2,085.9 million
    in fiscal 2007. Unit volume increased, driven by low end and
    mid-range systems, partially offset by a slight decrease in high
    end systems. In addition, average selling prices increased,
    driven by higher list prices and favorable configuration mix,
    partially offset by higher discounting. Revenue from add-on
    products increased, as customers focused on extending the
    capacity of their storage solutions.

Our systems are highly configurable to respond to customer
    requirements in the open systems storage markets that we serve.
    This wide variation in customer configurations can significantly
    impact revenue, cost of revenue, and gross margin performance.
    Price changes, unit volumes, and product configuration mix can
    also impact revenue, cost of revenue and gross margin
    performance. Disks are a significant component of our storage
    systems. Industry disk pricing continues to fall every year, and
    we pass along those price decreases to our customers while
    working to maintain relatively constant margins on our disk
    drives. While price per petabyte continues to decline, system
    performance, increased capacity and software to manage this
    increased capacity have an offsetting impact on product revenue.

primarily to the recognition of service contracts that were
    purchased or renewed in prior years, and to a lesser extent,
    service contracts entered into in fiscal 2009.

Software entitlements and maintenance revenues increased by
    $145.6 million, or 42.7% in fiscal 2008, compared to fiscal
    2007. The year over year increase was due to a larger installed
    base of customers who have purchased or renewed software

    increased service contract revenue related to an increase in the
    installed base. In addition, revenue from professional services
    increased due to increased integration consulting services
    provided in fiscal 2009 and improved productivity of our
    professional service personnel.

Service revenues increased by $196.7 million, or 52.1% in
    fiscal 2008, compared to fiscal 2007. The primary reasons for
    the increase were increased service contract revenue, related to
    an increase in the installed base and the average revenue
    generated per installed base unit, and an increase in
    professional services.

GSA

Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue
    increased by 5.0% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The
    increase in total costs was primarily due to increased unit
    volume. The increase in costs as a percentage of revenues was
    due to a larger decrease in average selling prices than
    corresponding costs, primarily standard material costs, across
    all of our systems.

Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue
    increased by 1.6% in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The
    increase in total costs was primarily due to increased unit
    volume. The increase in costs as a percentage of revenues was
    due to a lower increase in average selling prices than
    corresponding costs, primarily related to standard material
    costs on new low end systems.

Stock-based compensation expense included in cost of product
    revenues was $3.3 million, $3.4 million and
    $3.7 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.
    Amortization of existing technology included in cost of product
    revenues was $24.5 million, $22.6 million and
    $17.6 million for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we implemented a change in
    the reporting of warranty costs and reported these costs in cost
    of product revenues. These costs were included in cost of
    service revenues in previous periods. Our cost of product
    revenues and service revenues for fiscal years 2008 and 2007
    reflect a reclassification of $27.0 million and
    $22.1 million, respectively, to conform to current period
    presentation. There was no change in warranty costs as a
    percentage of product revenue in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007.

We expect future product gross margins to be impacted by a
    variety of factors including selective price reductions and
    discounts, increased indirect channel sales, higher software
    revenue mix and the margin profile of new products. If our
    shipment volumes, product mix, average selling prices and
    pricing actions that impact our product gross margin continue to
    be adversely affected by the economic downturn or market
    factors, our gross margin could decline.

    fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The increase in service
    cost of revenues in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and in
    fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to
    increased service infrastructure spending to support our
    customers, which included additional professional support
    engineers, increased support center activities for a larger
    installed base of product, and global service partnership
    programs. The decrease in service cost of revenues as a
    percentage of service revenue in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal
    2008 and fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased service
    revenue volume and improved productivity, partially offset by
    higher costs.

Stock-based compensation expense of $12.3 million was
    included in the cost of service revenue for fiscal 2009 compared
    to $10.4 million and $10.1 million for fiscal 2008 and
    2007, respectively.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we implemented a change in
    the reporting of warranty costs and reported these costs in cost
    of product revenues. These costs were included in cost of
    service revenues in previous periods. Our cost of product
    revenues and service revenues for fiscal years 2008 and 2007
    reflect a reclassification of $27.0 million and
    $22.1 million, respectively, to conform to current period
    presentation.

Service gross margin is also typically impacted by factors such
    as changes in the size of our installed base of product, as well
    as the timing of support service initiations and renewals, and
    incremental investments in our customer support infrastructure.

Sales and Marketing

— Sales and marketing
    expense consists primarily of salaries and related benefits,
    commissions, allocated facilities and IT costs, advertising and
    promotional expenses, stock-based compensation expense, and
    travel and entertainment expenses. Sales and marketing expense
    for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows:

Sales and marketing expense increased by $110.5 million, or
    10.3% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The increase was
    primarily due to an increase in salaries and related benefits
    primarily due to increased average compensation and incentive
    plan costs per person, and an increase in IT expenses related to
    new software implementations partially offset by a decrease in
    marketing expenses and travel and entertainment expenses.

The increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2008
    compared to fiscal 2007 was due to increased commission expenses
    resulting from increased revenues, higher payroll expenses due
    to higher profitability, higher partner program expenses, the
    continued worldwide investment in our sales and global service
    organizations associated with selling complete enterprise
    solutions, and higher stock-based compensation expenses.

Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2009 was favorably
    impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative
    to other foreign currencies (primarily Euro, British pound and
    Australian Dollar). Had foreign exchange rates remained constant
    in these periods, our sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2009
    would have been approximately $10.5 million higher, or
    0.9%, higher. The foreign currency exchange rate impact on sales
    and marketing expense was insignificant for fiscal 2008 and 2007.

Stock-based compensation expense included in sales and marketing
    expense in fiscal 2009 was $65.1 million compared to stock
    compensation expense of $65.4 million and
    $71.7 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Amortization of trademarks/trade names and customer
    contracts/relationships included in sales and marketing expense
    was $4.4 million in fiscal 2009 compared to
    $4.2 million and $2.9 million in fiscal 2008 and
    fiscal 2007, respectively.



Research and Development

— Research and
    development expense consists primarily of salaries and related
    benefits, allocated facilities and IT costs, depreciation and
    amortization, stock-based compensation, and prototype and
    engineering charges. Research and development expense for fiscal
    2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows:

Research and development expense increased by
    $46.3 million, or 10.2% in fiscal 2009 as compared to
    fiscal 2008. The increase in research and development expense
    was primarily due to an increase in salaries and related
    benefits resulting from increased average compensation and
    incentive plan costs per person, as well as higher average
    headcount, and an increase in facilities expenses related to new
    engineering labs.

The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2008
    compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due increased headcount,
    ongoing operating impact of acquisitions, ongoing current and
    future product development and enhancement efforts, higher
    performance-based payroll expenses due to higher profitability,
    and higher stock-based compensation expense.

Stock-based compensation expense included in research and
    development expense for fiscal 2009 was $37.9 million,
    compared to $46.6 million and $51.3 million in fiscal
    2008 and 2007, respectively. No software development costs were
    capitalized during any of the periods.

We believe that our future performance will depend in large part
    on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line,
    develop new products that achieve market acceptance, maintain
    technological competitiveness, and meet an expanding range of
    customer requirements. We expect to continuously support current
    and future product development, broaden our existing product
    offerings and introduce new products that expand our solutions
    portfolio.

General and Administrative

— General and
    administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and
    related benefits, professional and corporate legal fees,
    stock-based compensation, recruiting expenses, and allocated
    facilities and IT costs. General and administrative expense for
    fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows:

General and administrative expense increased by

    professional and legal fees, an increase in salaries and related
    benefits primarily resulting from increased average compensation
    and incentive plan costs per person, and an increase in IT
    expenses.

The increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal
    2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to higher payroll
    expenses due to higher profitability and increased headcount,
    higher stock-based compensation expense recognized, and higher
    legal and professional fees for general corporate matters.

Stock-based compensation expense included in general and
    administrative expense in fiscal 2009 was $22.2 million
    compared to $22.1 million and $26.2 million for fiscal
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Restructuring
    and Other Charges

Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plans —

In February
    2009, we announced our decision to execute a worldwide
    restructuring program, which included a reduction in workforce,
    the closing or downsizing of certain facilities, and the
    establishment of a plan to outsource certain internal
    activities. In December 2008, we announced our decision to cease
    the development and availability of SMOS, which was originally
    acquired through our acquisition of Topio in fiscal 2007. As
    part of this decision, we also announced the closure of our
    engineering facility in Haifa, Israel. These restructuring
    activities resulted in restructuring charges totaling
    $51.5 million of severance-related amounts and other
    charges attributable to the termination of approximately 450
    regular positions, abandoned excess facilities



charges relating to non-cancelable lease costs, which are net of
    expected sublease income; contract cancellation charges;
    outplacement expenses; fixed assets and intangibles write-offs;
    as well as $2.9 million of other charges to support our
    restructuring initiatives. In recording the facility lease
    restructuring reserve, we made certain estimates and assumptions
    related to the (i) time period over which the relevant
    buildings would remain vacant, (ii) sublease terms, and
    (iii) sublease rates.

As of April 24, 2009, approximately $15.9 million of
    the costs associated with these activities were unpaid. We
    expect that severance-related charges and other costs will be
    substantially paid by the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and the
    facilities-related lease payments to be substantially paid by
    the third quarter of fiscal 2013.

Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Plan —

As of
    April 24, 2009, we also have $1.3 million remaining in
    facility restructuring reserves established as part of a
    restructuring in fiscal 2002 related to future lease commitments
    on exited facilities, net of expected sublease income. We
    reevaluate our estimates and assumptions periodically and make
    adjustments as necessary based on the time period over which the
    facilities will be vacant, expected sublease terms, and expected
    sublease rates. During fiscal 2009, we recorded restructuring
    recoveries of $0.1 million resulting from a change in the
    estimated operating expenses relating to this facility
    restructuring reserve. We expect to substantially fulfill the
    remaining contractual obligations related to this facility
    restructuring reserve by fiscal 2011.

Of the restructuring reserve balance at April 24, 2009,
    $14.7 million was included in other accrued liabilities,
    and the remaining $2.5 million was classified as other
    long-term obligations.

See Note 13, “Restructuring and Other Charges,”
    of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements for
    further discussion of our restructuring activities.

The decrease in interest income in fiscal 2009 compared to
    fiscal 2008 was primarily due to lower market yields on our cash
    and investment portfolio, in part due to a shift of our
    portfolio to shorter term investments with lower risk. This
    yield decline was partially offset by an increase in our cash
    and investment balances due to the issuance of the Convertible
    Notes (the “Note”), see Note 4, “Convertible
    Notes and Credit Facilities” of the consolidated financial
    statements. The decrease in interest income in fiscal 2008
    compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily driven by lower average
    interest rates on our investment portfolio and lower cash and
    investment balances.

We expect that period-to-period changes in interest income will
    continue to be impacted by the volatility of market interest
    rates, cash and investment balances, cash generated by
    operations, timing of our stock repurchases, cash used in
    acquisitions, capital expenditures, and payments of our
    contractual obligations.

The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2009 compared to
    fiscal 2008 was primarily due to interest expense and
    amortization of debt issuance costs on our 1.75% convertible
    senior notes (the “Notes”), partially offset by lower
    interest expense related to the reduced outstanding balance on
    our secured credit agreement we entered into with JPMorgan in
    October 2007. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2008
    compared to fiscal 2007 was due to full repayment of the loan
    agreement entered with JPMorgan (“Loan Agreement”),
    partially offset by increased interest expense on the
    $250.0 million outstanding under the revolving secured
    credit agreement with JPMorgan Securities during fiscal 2008.



We expect period-to-period changes in interest expense to
    fluctuate based on market interest rate volatility and amounts
    that may be due from time to time under various outstanding debt
    agreements. In addition, upon adoption of the new FSP APB

No. 14-1,

“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash Upon Conversion”

(“FSP APB

No. 14-1”),

we will account separately for the estimated liability and
    equity components of our Notes. As a result, we will record
    incremental interest expense in connection with the
    nonconvertible debt borrowing rate in our Consolidated
    Statements of Operations.

Net gain on sale of investments was $12.6 million for
    fiscal 2008. Net gain for fiscal 2008 consisted primarily of a
    gain of $13.6 million related to the sale of shares of Blue
    Coat common stock offset by a net write-down of
    $1.0 million for our investments in privately-held
    companies. For fiscal 2007, net loss on sale of investments was

For fiscal 2009, we applied to pretax income an effective tax
    rate benefit of 77.6% before discrete reporting items. After
    taking into account the tax effect of federal research tax
    credit and other immaterial items, the effective tax rate
    benefit for fiscal 2009 was 93.1%, and the effective tax rate
    expense for fiscal 2008 and 2007 was 19.1% and 17.2%,
    respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal, 2009, which was
    negative and thus a benefit, decreased relative to the effective
    tax rate for fiscal, 2008 primarily due to the decrease in the
    U.S. portion of our income and to the benefits generated
    from the retroactive extension of the research and development
    tax credit which was part of the Emergency Economic
    Stabilization Act of 2008. The geographic composition of our
    consolidated income was impacted by losses generated in the
    U.S. for restructuring charges and the GSA settlement.
    These charges resulted in a taxable loss in the U.S. which
    primarily drove the tax benefit.

For fiscal 2008 and 2007, we applied to pretax income an annual
    effective tax rate before discrete reporting items of 13.3% and
    19.0%, respectively. The decrease in the annual effective tax
    rate in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily
    attributable to a relative increase in the benefits attributable
    to our foreign operations, as well as to a relative decrease in
    the tax impact of nondeductible stock-based compensation,
    brought about in part by



our decision to cease granting incentive stock options. Since we
    have replaced the granting of incentive stock options with the
    granting of nonqualified stock options, this gives rise to the
    recognition of more income tax benefits as stock-based
    compensation is recognized.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The following sections discuss our principal liquidity
    requirements, as well as our sources and uses of cash flow on
    our liquidity and capital resources. The principal objectives of
    our investment policy are the preservation of principal and
    maintenance of liquidity. We attempt to mitigate default risk by
    investing in high-quality investment grade securities, limiting
    the time to maturity and by monitoring the counter-parties and
    underlying obligors closely. We believe our cash equivalents and
    short-term investments are liquid and accessible. We are not
    aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our
    cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of
    April 24, 2009.

Liquidity
    Sources, Cash Requirements

Our principal sources of liquidity as of April 24, 2009,
    consisted of: (1) approximately $2.6 billion in cash
    and cash equivalents and short-term investments, (2) cash
    we expect to generate from operations, and (3) an unsecured
    revolving credit facility totaling $250.0 million, of which
    $0.6 million has been allocated as of April 24, 2009
    to support certain of our outstanding letters of credit. Our
    principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our
    working capital needs, including a one-time payment of
    $128.7 million related to our GSA settlement, support
    ongoing business activities, implement restructuring plans,
    research and development, capital expenditure needs, the
    proposed Data Domain acquisition and other business
    acquisitions, investment in critical or complementary
    technologies, and to service our debt and synthetic leases.

Key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in
    our revenue mix and profitability as well as our ability to
    effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts
    receivable and inventories and whether or not we ultimately
    complete the merger with Data Domain discussed below. Based on
    our current business outlook, we believe that our sources of
    cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash
    requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, in
    the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to
    further curtail spending and implement additional cost saving
    measures and restructuring actions. In light of the current
    economic and market conditions, we cannot be certain that we
    will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels
    or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if
    necessary, on satisfactory terms, if at all.

Our investment portfolio, including the Primary Fund and auction
    rate securities has been and will continue to be exposed to
    market risk due to uncertainties in the credit and capital
    markets. In fiscal 2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary
    impairment charge to earnings of $21.1 million related to
    Lehman Brothers corporate bonds and the Primary Fund that held
    Lehman Brothers investments. In addition, we also recorded an
    other-than-temporary impairment of $2.1 million relating to
    certain auction rate securities. We could realize additional
    losses in our holdings of the Primary Fund and may not receive
    all or a portion of our remaining balance in the Primary Fund as
    a result of market conditions and ongoing litigation against the
    fund. However, we are not dependent on liquidating these
    investments in the next twelve months in order to meet our
    liquidity needs. We continue to closely monitor current economic
    and market events to minimize our market risk on our investment
    portfolio. Based on our ability to access our cash and
    short-term investments, our expected operating cash flows, and
    our other potential sources of cash, we do not anticipate that
    the lack of liquidity of these investments will impact our
    ability to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures,
    acquisitions or other cash requirements. We intend to and
    believe that we have the ability to hold these investments until
    the market recovers. If current market conditions deteriorate
    further, or the anticipated recovery in market values does not
    occur, we may be required to record additional charges to
    earnings in future quarters.

Capital
    Expenditure Requirements

We expect to fund our capital expenditures, including our
    commitments related to facilities and equipment operating leases
    over the next few years through cash generated from operations,
    existing cash, cash equivalents and investments. The timing and
    amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely
    determined at this time and will



depend on a number of factors including future demand for
    products, product mix, changes in the network storage industry,
    economic conditions and market competition. We expect that our
    existing facilities in Sunnyvale, California; Research Triangle
    Park, North Carolina; and worldwide are adequate for our
    requirements over at least the next two years, and that
    additional space will be available as needed. However, if
    current economic conditions deteriorate further, we may be
    required to implement additional restructuring plans to
    eliminate or consolidate excess facilities, incur cancellation
    penalties and impair fixed assets.

Acquisition
    Related Requirements

On May 20, 2009, we announced our entry into a definitive
    agreement with Data Domain, Inc. to acquire such company in a
    merger for an aggregate merger consideration of approximately
    $1.5 billion in cash and common stock (net of Data
    Domain’s cash balances). On June 3, 2009, we revised
    the terms of the definitive agreement to increase the aggregate
    merger consideration to $1.9 billion (net of Data
    Domain’s cash balance). If the acquisition is completed
    under the current terms, we expect that we will have to use at
    least $1 billion of our cash, cash equivalent and
    investments for cash consideration to Data Domain shareholders
    and transaction costs. The merger is subject to customary
    closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. The
    transaction is valued at approximately $2 billion and is
    expected to be completed in 60 to 120 days.

Cash
    Flows

As of April 24, 2009, compared to April 25, 2008, our
    cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments increased
    by $1,439.8 million to $2,604.2 million. The increase
    in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was
    primarily a result of net proceeds from issuance of the Notes
    and warrants, cash provided by operating activities, issuance of
    common stock related to employee stock option exercises and
    employee stock purchases, partially offset by stock repurchases,
    execution of the Note Hedge, capital expenditures, and repayment
    of the secured revolving credit facility. We derive our
    liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flow
    from operations and from working capital. Working capital
    increased by $1,106.1 million to $1,759.5 million as
    of April 24, 2009, compared to $653.3 million as of
    April 25, 2008.

Cash
    Flows from Operating Activities

During fiscal 2009, we generated cash flows from operating
    activities of $873.4 million, compared with
    $1,008.9 million and $864.5 million for fiscal 2008
    and fiscal 2007, respectively. We recorded net income of
    $86.5 million for fiscal 2009, compared to
    $309.7 million and $297.7 million for fiscal 2008 and
    fiscal 2007, respectively. A summary of the significant changes
    in noncash adjustments affecting net income and changes in
    assets and liabilities impacting operating cash flows is as
    follows:

•

Stock-based compensation expense was $140.8 million in
    fiscal 2009, compared to $148.0 million and
    $163.0 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    decrease in stock-based compensation was primarily a result of a
    lower fair value of equity awards driven by our declining stock
    price.

•

Depreciation and amortization expense was $170.5 million,
    $144.2 million, and $110.8 million in fiscal 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase for depreciation was
    due to continued capital expansion during fiscal 2009 and 2008.
    The increase for amortization expense was due to an increase in
    intangibles related to the Onaro acquisition in fiscal 2008,
    partially offset by the impairment of certain acquired
    intangible assets related to the Topio acquisition in fiscal
    2009.

•

Asset impairment charges and write-offs of $31.6 million
    during fiscal 2009 related to impairment of intangibles and
    leasehold improvements in connection with our restructuring
    plans in fiscal 2009, as well as a write-off related to a sales
    force automation tool recorded in fiscal 2009.

•

Impairment losses (gains) on investment consist of
    other-than-temporary impairment of $20.3 million related to
    investments in Lehman Brothers securities, a decline in the
    value of our auction rate securities and impairment losses on
    investment in privately held companies during fiscal 2009. A
    gain on sale of investments of $12.6 million during fiscal
    2008 included sale of Blue Coat common shares of
    $13.6 million.



•

Deferred income tax provisions of $108.4 million,
    $53.0 million and $146.0 million were due to temporary
    tax differences associated with such items as accruals, deferred
    revenue, stock compensation tax benefits, and net operating
    losses and credit carryforwards.

•

The decrease in accounts receivable of $128.7 million
    during fiscal 2009 was due to improved collections. The increase
    in accounts receivable of $27.7 million and
    $175.2 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, was
    due to increased shipment levels weighted towards the end of the
    fourth quarter, offset by timing of collections.

•

The decrease in inventories of $9.1 million during fiscal
    2009 was due to increased inventory reserves as a result of
    lower customer demand due to depressed economic conditions.
    Inventories increased $15.4 million in fiscal 2008 due to
    higher inventory required to support revenue growth during the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Inventories decreased
    $9.9 million for fiscal 2007, primarily due to higher
    inventory at fiscal 2006 year end associated with the new
    FAS 6000 launch.

•

The increases in deferred revenues of $219.3 million and
    $401.0 million during fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively,
    were primarily due to increased service contract and software
    entitlement and maintenance contract sales, partially offset by
    the recognition of previously deferred revenues. An increase in
    deferred revenue of $421.3 million in fiscal 2007 was due
    to larger installed base renewals for service contracts and
    software entitlement and maintenance contracts, upgrades and an
    increased number of new enterprise customers purchasing software
    entitlement and maintenance contracts.

•

The decrease in accounts payable of $27.0 million during
    fiscal 2009 was due to timing of payment activities. The
    increase in accounts payable of $20.0 million and
    $36.6 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, was
    primarily attributable to elevated purchasing activity required
    to support our business growth and facilities expansion projects.

•

The accrual for the GSA settlement of $128.7 million in
    fiscal 2009 consisted of the unpaid liability related to that
    matter.

•

The increase in accrued compensation and related benefits of
    $12.9 million, $18.8 million and $43.6 million in
    fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, reflected increased
    headcount and the timing of payroll accruals versus payments.

Other changes in prepaid expenses, other accrued liabilities,
    income taxes payable, and other liabilities balances were due to
    timing of payments versus recognition of assets or liabilities.
    We expect that cash provided by operating activities may
    fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors,
    including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at
    which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to
    as shipment linearity), accounts receivable collections,
    inventory and supply chain management, excess tax benefits from
    stock-based compensation, and the timing and amount of tax and
    other payments.

Cash
    Flows from Investing Activities

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 were $289.7 million as
    compared to $188.3 million and $165.8 million in
    fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. We used $116.8 million
    in fiscal 2009 and received $376.4 million and
    $187.9 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, for
    net purchases and redemptions of short-term investments, and
    restricted investments. During fiscal 2009, we reclassified
    $598.0 million of cash equivalents relating to the Primary
    Fund to short-term investments. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    we received $1.1 million, $19.2 million and
    $2.8 million, respectively, from the sale of nonmarketable
    and marketable securities. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, we
    also used $0.3 million, $4.2 million and
    $1.6 million for purchases of nonmarketable and marketable
    securities. In fiscal 2008, we acquired Onaro, Inc. and remitted
    total cash payments including related transaction costs totaling
    $99.6 million and received $0.2 million escrow related
    to our Topio acquisition. In fiscal 2007, we acquired Topio,
    Inc. and remitted total cash payments including related
    transaction costs totaling $131.2 million. In fiscal 2007,
    we received $23.9 million in cash in connection with the
    sale of certain assets to Blue Coat.



Cash
    Flows from Financing Activities

We received $696.6 million in fiscal 2009 and used
    $662.4 million and $747.3 million in fiscal 2008 and
    2007, respectively from financing activities. During fiscal
    2009, 2008 and 2007, we made repayments of $172.6 million,
    $231.5 million and $214.9 million, respectively, in
    connection with our Secured Credit Agreement and the Term Loan.
    We repurchased 17.0 million, 32.8 million and
    22.6 million shares of common stock for a total of
    $400.0 million, $903.7 million and $805.7 million
    in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Proceeds from
    employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases
    were $91.0 million, $114.7 million and
    $215.5 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Tax benefits, related to tax deductions in excess of stock-based
    compensation expense recognized, of $36.7 million,
    $45.4 million and $63.2 million for 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, we
    withheld shares with an aggregate value of $5.1 million,
    $6.0 million and $5.3 million, respectively, in
    connection with the vesting of certain employees’
    restricted stock units for purposes of satisfying those
    employees’ federal, state, and local withholding tax
    obligations. In addition, during fiscal 2009, we issued
    $1.265 billion of convertible notes and paid financing
    costs of $26.6 million. We also received proceeds of
    $163.1 million for sale of common stock warrants, and paid
    $254.9 million for purchase of Note Hedges. During fiscal
    2008, we borrowed $318.8 million through a Secured Credit
    Agreement.

Net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to
    employee participation in employee stock programs have
    historically been a significant component of our liquidity. The
    extent to which our employees participate in these programs
    generally increases or decreases based upon changes in the
    market price of our common stock. As a result, our cash flow
    resulting from the issuance of common stock in connection with
    employee participation in employee stock programs and related
    tax benefits will vary.

Stock
    Repurchase Program

At April 24, 2009, $1,096.3 million remained available
    for future repurchases under plans approved as of that date. The
    stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any
    time.

Convertible
    Notes

In June 2008, we issued $1.265 billion of
    1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 and concurrently
    entered into Note Hedges and separate warrant transactions. See
    Note 4, “Convertible Notes and Credit Facilities”
    of the consolidated financial statements. The Notes will mature
    on June 1, 2013, unless earlier repurchased or converted.
    As of April 24, 2009, the Notes have not been repurchased
    or converted. We also have not received any shares under the
    Note Hedges or delivered cash or shares under the Warrants.

Credit
    Facilities

As of April 24, 2009, we have an unsecured revolving credit
    facility totaling $250.0 million, of which
    $0.6 million has been allocated as of April 24, 2009
    to support certain of our outstanding letters of credit (See
    Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements.)

This credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial
    covenants, with which we were in compliance as of April 24,
    2009. Such specified financial covenants include a maximum ratio
    of Total Debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation
    and Amortization (“EBITDA”) and a minimum amount of
    Unencumbered Cash and Short-Term Investments. Our failure to
    comply with these financial covenants could result in a default
    under the credit facilities, which would give the counterparties
    thereto the ability to exercise certain rights, including the
    right to accelerate the amounts outstanding thereunder and to
    terminate the facility. We were in compliance with all of our
    financial covenants at April 24, 2009.

For purposes of the above table, contractual obligations for the
    purchase of goods and services are defined as agreements that
    are enforceable, are legally binding on us, and subject us to
    penalties if we cancel the agreement. Some of the figures we
    include in this table are based on management’s estimates
    and assumptions about these obligations, including their
    duration, the possibility of renewal or termination, anticipated
    actions by management and third parties, and other factors.
    Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily
    subjective, our actual future obligations may vary from those
    reflected in the table.



We have commitments related to four lease arrangements with
    BNPPLC for approximately 564,274 square feet of office
    space for our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. As of
    April 24, 2009, we have a leasing arrangements
    (“Leasing Arrangements 1”) which requires us to lease
    a portion of our land in Sunnyvale to BNPPLC for a period of
    99 years and to lease approximately 190,000 square
    feet of space costing up to $48.5 million. As of
    April 24, 2009, we also have commitments relating to
    financing and operating leasing arrangements with BNPPLC
    (“Leasing Arrangements 2, 3, 4”) for land and
    approximately 374,274 square feet of buildings located in
    Sunnyvale, California, costing up to $101.1 million. Under
    these leasing arrangements, we began paying BNPPLC minimum lease
    payments, which vary based on LIBOR plus a spread or a fixed
    rate on the costs of the facilities on the respective lease
    commencement dates. We will make payments for each of the leases
    for a term of five years. We have the option to renew each of
    the leases for two consecutive five-year periods upon approval
    by BNPPLC. Upon expiration (or upon any earlier termination) of
    the lease terms, we must elect one of the following options:
    (i) purchase the buildings from BNPPLC at cost;
    (ii) if certain conditions are met, arrange for the sale of
    the buildings by BNPPLC to a third party for an amount equal to
    at least 85% of the costs (residual guarantee), and be liable
    for any deficiency between the net proceeds received from the
    third party and such amounts; or (iii) pay BNPPLC
    supplemental payments for an amount equal to at least 85% of the
    costs (residual guarantee), in which event we may recoup some or
    all of such payments by arranging for a sale of each or all
    buildings by BNPPLC during the ensuing two-year period. The
    following table summarizes the costs, the residual guarantee,
    the applicable LIBOR plus spread or fixed rate at April 24,
    2009, and the date we began to make payments for each of our

All leases require us to maintain specified financial covenants
    with which we were in compliance as of April 24, 2009. Such
    specified financial covenants include a maximum ratio of Total
    Debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and
    Amortization (“EBITDA”) and a minimum amount of
    Unencumbered Cash and Short-Term Investments. Our failure to
    comply with these financial covenants could result in a default
    under the leases which, subject to our right and ability to
    exercise our purchase option, would give BNPPLC the right to,
    among other things, (i) terminate our possession of the
    leased property and require us to pay lease termination damages
    and other amounts as set forth in the lease agreements, or
    (ii) exercise certain foreclosure remedies. If we were to
    exercise our purchase option, or be required to pay lease
    termination damages, these payments would significantly reduce
    our available liquidity, which could constrain our operating
    flexibility.



We may from time to time terminate one or more of our leasing
    arrangements and repay amounts outstanding in order to meet our
    operating or other objectives. For example, on April 1,
    2009, we terminated two leasing arrangement in connection with
    two buildings located in Sunnyvale, California and Research
    Triangle Park, North Carolina and repaid
    $119.3 million of the outstanding balance under the leasing
    arrangements. On December 1, 2008, we terminated a leasing
    arrangement in connection with a separate building located in
    Sunnyvale, California and repaid $8.1 million of the
    outstanding balance drawn under the construction allowance. As a
    result of these terminations, we are no longer contractually
    obligated to pay the lease payments for the lease periods and
    the residual guarantees.

Legal
    Contingencies

On September 5, 2007, we filed a patent infringement
    lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory
    damages and a permanent injunction against Sun Microsystems. On
    October 25, 2007, Sun Microsystems filed a counter
    claim against us in the Eastern District of Texas seeking
    compensatory damages and a permanent injunction. On
    October 29, 2007, Sun filed a second lawsuit against us in
    the Northern District of California asserting additional patents
    against us. The Texas court granted a joint motion to transfer
    the Texas lawsuit to the Northern District of California on
    November 26, 2007. On March 26, 2008, Sun filed a
    third lawsuit in federal court that extends the patent
    infringement charges to storage management technology we
    acquired in January 2008. The three lawsuits are currently in
    the discovery phase and no trial date has been set, so we are
    unable at this time to determine the likely outcome of these
    various patent litigations. In addition, as we are unable to
    reasonably estimate the amount or range of the potential
    settlement, no accrual has been recorded as of April 24,
    2009.

In April 2009, we entered into a settlement agreement with the
    United States of America, acting through the United States
    Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and on behalf of the
    General Services Administration (the “GSA”), under
    which we agreed to pay the United States $128.0 million,
    plus interest of $0.7 million, related to a dispute
    regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price
    reduction clause provisions of GSA contracts between August 1997
    and February 2005.

In addition, we are subject to various legal proceedings and
    claims which have arisen or may arise in the normal course of
    business. While the outcome of these legal matters is currently
    not determinable, we do not believe that any current litigation
    or claims will have a material adverse effect on our business,
    cash flow, operating results, or financial condition.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

During the ordinary course of business, we provide standby
    letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third
    parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by
    us or our subsidiaries. As of April 24, 2009, our financial
    guarantees of $5.9 million that were not recorded on our
    balance sheet consisted of standby letters of credit related to
    workers’ compensation, a customs guarantee, a corporate
    credit card program, foreign rent guarantees and surety bonds,
    which were primarily related to self-insurance.

We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign
    currency risk. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is
    to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated
    with changes in foreign currency. The program is not designated
    for trading or speculative purposes Currently, we do not enter
    into any foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures
    related to firm commitments or nonmarketable investments. Our
    major foreign currency exchange exposures and related hedging
    programs are described below:

•

We utilize monthly foreign currency forward and options
    contracts to hedge exchange rate fluctuations related to certain
    foreign monetary assets and liabilities.

•

We use currency forward contracts to hedge exposures related to
    forecasted sales denominated in certain foreign currencies.
    These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and in
    general closely match the underlying forecasted transactions in
    duration.

As of April 24, 2009, our notional fair value of foreign
    exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled
    $314.0 million. We do not believe that these derivatives
    present significant credit risks, because the



counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial
    institutions, and we manage the notional amount of contracts
    entered into with any one counterparty. We do not enter into
    derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading
    purposes. Other than the risk associated with the financial
    condition of the counterparties, our maximum exposure related to
    foreign currency forward and option contracts is limited to the
    premiums paid.

We have entered into indemnification agreements with third
    parties in the ordinary course of business. Generally, these
    indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses
    suffered by the third party due to various events, such as
    lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement. These
    indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet
    arrangements in accordance with FASB Interpretation 45, of
    FIN No. 45,

“Guarantor’s Accounting and
    Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
    Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.”

We have commitments related to four lease arrangements with
    BNPPLC for approximately 564,274 square feet of office
    space for our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California (as further
    described above under “Contractual Obligations”).

We have evaluated our accounting for these leases under the
    provisions of FIN No. 46R and have determined the
    following:

•

BNPPLC is a leasing company for BNP Paribas in the United
    States. BNPPLC is not a “special purpose entity”
    organized for the sole purpose of facilitating the leases to us.
    The obligation to absorb expected losses and receive expected
    residual returns rests with the parent, BNP Paribas. Therefore,
    we are not the primary beneficiary of BNPPLC as we do not absorb
    the majority of BNPPLC’s expected losses or expected
    residual returns; and

•

BNPPLC has represented in the related closing agreements that
    the fair value of the property leased to us by BNPPLC is less
    than half of the total of the fair values of all assets of
    BNPPLC, excluding any assets of BNPPLC held within a silo.
    Further, the property leased to NetApp is not held within a
    silo. The definition of “held within a silo” means
    that BNPPLC has obtained funds equal to or in excess of 95% of
    the fair value of the leased asset to acquire or maintain its
    investment in such asset through nonrecourse financing or other
    contractual arrangements, the effect of which is to leave such
    asset (or proceeds thereof) as the only significant asset of
    BNPPLC at risk for the repayment of such funds.

Accordingly, under the provisions of FIN No. 46R, we
    are not required to consolidate either the leasing entity or the
    specific assets that we lease under the BNPPLC lease. Our future
    minimum lease payments and residual guarantees under these real
    estate leases will amount to a total of $141.1 million as
    reported under our Note 15, “Commitments and
    Contingencies.”

We also have operating leases for various facilities. Total
    rental expense for operating leases was $28.8 million for
    fiscal 2009, $29.6 million for fiscal 2008, and
    $24.0 million for fiscal 2007.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in
    interest rates, market prices, and foreign currency exchange
    rates. We use certain derivative financial instruments to manage
    these risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for
    speculative or trading purposes. All financial instruments are
    used in accordance with management-approved policies.

Market
    Risk and Market Interest Risk

Investment and Interest Income

— As of
    April 24, 2009, we had available-for-sale investments of
    $1,228.2 million. Our investment portfolio primarily
    consists of investments with original maturities at the date of
    purchase of greater than three months, which are classified as
    available-for-sale. These investments, consisting primarily of
    corporate bonds, corporate securities, U.S. government
    agency bonds, U.S. Treasuries, certificates of deposit, and
    money market funds, are subject to interest rate and interest
    income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates
    increase. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in market
    interest rates from levels at April 24, 2009 would cause
    the fair value of these available-for-sale investments to
    decline by approximately $1.6 million.



Because we have the ability to hold these investments until
    maturity, we would not expect any significant decline in value
    of our investments caused by market interest rate changes.
    Declines in interest rates over time will, however, reduce our
    interest income. We do not use derivative financial instruments
    in our investment portfolio.

Our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through
    diversification and investment in highly rated securities. We
    further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our
    investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities
    of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies
    and type of issuer. We actively review, along with our
    investment advisors, current investment ratings, company
    specific events, and general economic conditions in managing our
    investments and in determining whether there is a significant
    decline in fair value that is other-than-temporary. As a result
    of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers, we recorded in
    fiscal 2009 an other-than-temporary impairment charge of
    $11.8 million on our corporate bonds related to investments
    in Lehman Brothers securities and approximately
    $9.3 million on our investments in the Reserve Primary
    Fund, which also held Lehman Brothers investments. We will
    continue to monitor and evaluate the accounting for our
    investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for additional
    other-than-temporary impairment charges. We could realize
    additional losses in our holdings of the Primary Fund and may
    not receive all or a portion of our remaining balance in the
    Primary Fund as a result of market conditions and ongoing
    litigation against the fund.

We are also exposed to market risk relating to our auction rate
    securities due to uncertainties in the credit and capital
    markets. As of April 24, 2009, we determined there was a
    total decline in the fair value of our auction rate securities
    investments of approximately $8.8 million, of which we
    recorded temporary impairment charges of $7.0 million,
    offset by unrealized gains of $0.3 million, and
    $2.1 million was recognized as an other-than-temporary
    impairment charge. The fair value of our auction rate securities
    may change significantly due to events and conditions in the
    credit and capital markets. These securities/issuers could be
    subject to review for possible downgrade. Any downgrade in these
    credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the
    estimated fair value of our auction rate securities. Changes in
    the various assumptions used to value these securities and any
    increase in the markets’ perceived risk associated with
    such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair
    value.

If current market conditions deteriorate further, or the
    anticipated recovery in market values does not occur, we may be
    required to record additional unrealized losses in other
    comprehensive income (loss) or other-than-temporary impairment
    charges to earnings in future quarters. We intend and have the
    ability to hold these investments until the market recovers. We
    do not believe that the lack of liquidity relating to our
    portfolio investments will impact our ability to fund working
    capital needs, capital expenditures or other operating
    requirements. See Note 8, “Fair Value
    Measurement,” to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8; Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
    “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” in Part II,
    Item 7; and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for a description of recent market events that may affect the
    value and liquidity of the investments in our portfolio that we
    held at April 24, 2009.

Lease Commitments

— As of April 24, 2009,
    one of our four lease arrangements with BNPPLC is based on a
    floating interest rate. The minimum lease payments will vary
    based on LIBOR plus a spread. All of our leases have a term of
    five years, and we have the option to renew these leases for two
    consecutive five-year periods upon approval by BNPPLC. A
    hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rate
    from the level at April 24, 2009 would increase our lease
    payments on this one floating lease arrangement under the
    initial five-year term by an immaterial amount. We do not
    currently hedge against market interest rate increases. As
    additional cash flow generated from operations is invested at
    current market rates, it will offer a natural hedge against
    interest rate risk from our lease commitments in the event of a
    significant change in market interest rate.

Convertible Notes

— In June 2008, we issued
    $1.265 billion principal amount of 1.75% Notes due
    2013. Holders may convert their Notes prior to maturity upon the
    occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would
    pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares
    of our common stock, up to the principal amount of the Note.
    Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid
    in cash or in stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance
    of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge
    transactions and separately, warrant transactions, to reduce the
    potential dilution from the conversion of the Notes and to
    mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the
    price of our common stock.



Our Notes have fixed annual interest rates at 1.75% and
    therefore, we do not have significant interest rate exposure on
    our Notes. However, we are exposed to interest rate risk.
    Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate
    Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as
    interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our Notes is
    affected by our stock price. The carrying value of our Notes was
    $1.265 billion, excluding $22.2 million of deferred
    debt issuance costs and total estimated fair value of our
    convertible debt at April 24, 2009 was $1.143 billion.
    The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price
    per $100 of our 1.75% Notes as of the last day of trading
    for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, which was $90.38.

Nonmarketable Securities

— We have from time to
    time made cash investments in companies with distinctive
    technologies that are potentially strategically important to us.
    Our investments in nonmarketable securities would be negatively
    affected by an adverse change in equity market prices, although
    the impact cannot be directly quantified. Such a change, or any
    negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the
    companies whose nonmarketable securities we own, would harm the
    ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the
    likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of
    our investments through liquidity events such as initial public
    offerings, acquisitions, and private sales. These types of
    investments involve a high degree of risk, and there can be no
    assurance that any company we invest in will grow or be
    successful. We do not currently engage in any hedging activities
    to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to such
    nonmarketable investments. Accordingly, we could lose all or
    part of these investments if there is an adverse change in the
    market price of a company we invest in. Our investments in
    nonmarketable securities had a carrying amount of
    $4.0 million as of April 24, 2009 and
    $11.2 million as of April 25, 2008. If we determine
    that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value exists for a
    nonmarketable equity security, we write down the investment to
    its fair value and record the related write-down as an
    investment loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
    During fiscal 2009, we recorded net losses of $6.3 million
    for our investments in privately held companies.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward
    Contracts

We hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to
    minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates on earnings. We utilize forward and option contracts to
    hedge against the short-term impact of foreign currency
    fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in
    foreign currencies. All balance sheet hedges are marked to
    market through earnings every period. We also use foreign
    exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted
    transactions related to forecasted sales transactions. These
    derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under
    SFAS No. 133. For cash flow hedges outstanding at
    April 24, 2009, the time-value component is recorded in
    earnings while all other gains or losses were included in other
    comprehensive income.

We do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative
    or trading purposes. In entering into forward and option foreign
    exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise
    from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms
    of their contracts. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit
    risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy
    multinational commercial banks. All contracts have a maturity of
    less than one year.



Item 8.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

NetApp, Inc.

Sunnyvale, California

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    NetApp, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, the
    “Company”) as of April 24, 2009 and
    April 25, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of
    operations, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period
    ended April 24, 2009. Our audits also included the
    consolidated financial statement schedule listed in
    Item 15. These financial statements and the financial
    statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    financial statements and the financial statement schedule based
    on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    NetApp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of April 24, 2009 and
    April 25, 2008, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    April 24, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
    opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, in the year ended April 25, 2008, the Company
    changed its method of measuring and recognizing tax benefits
    associated with uncertain tax positions in accordance with
    Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    April 24, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated June 16, 2009 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except per-share
    data)

1.

The
    Company

Based in Sunnyvale, California, NetApp, Inc. (“we” or
    “the Company”) was incorporated in California in
    April 1992 and reincorporated in Delaware in November 2001;
    in March 2008, the Company changed its name from Network
    Appliance, Inc. to NetApp, Inc. The Company is a supplier of
    enterprise storage and data management software and hardware
    products and services. Our solutions help global enterprises
    meet major information technology challenges such as managing
    storage growth, assuring secure and timely information access,
    protecting data and controlling costs by providing innovative
    solutions that simplify the complexity associated with managing
    corporate data.

2.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Fiscal Year

— We operate on a 52-week or
    53-week year ending on the last Friday in April. Fiscal 2009,
    2008 and 2007 were all 52-week fiscal years.

Basis of Presentation

— The consolidated
    financial statements include the Company and its wholly-owned
    subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions are
    eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassification

— In the first quarter of
    fiscal 2009, we implemented a change in the reporting of
    warranty costs and reported these costs in cost of product
    revenues. These costs, which were included in cost of service
    revenues in previous periods, amounted to $26,997 and $22,082
    for fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively, and have been
    reclassified on the accompanying financial statements to conform
    to current year classification. This change had no effect on the
    reported amounts of total costs of revenues, total gross margin,
    net income or cash flow from operations for any period presented.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of the
    consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates
    include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition and
    allowances; allowance for doubtful accounts; valuation of
    goodwill and intangibles; fair value of derivative instruments
    and related hedged items; accounting for income taxes; inventory
    valuation and contractual commitments; restructuring accruals;
    warranty reserve; impairment losses on investments; fair value
    of options granted under our stock-based compensation plans; and
    loss contingencies. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

Concentration of Credit Risk

— Financial
    instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of
    credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments,
    foreign exchange contracts and accounts receivable. Cash
    equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of
    corporate bonds, U.S. government agency securities, and
    money market funds, all of which are considered high investment
    grade. Our policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure
    through diversification and investment in highly rated
    securities. We further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in
    our investments by limiting our investments in the debt
    securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across
    geographies and type of issuer.

Our long term investments, including the Primary Fund and
    auction rate securities have been and will continue to be
    exposed to market risk due to uncertainties in the credit and
    capital markets. In fiscal 2009, we recorded an
    other-than-temporary impairment charge to earnings of $23,251
    related to auction rate securities, Lehman Brothers corporate
    bonds and the Primary Fund that held Lehman Brothers investments.

In entering into forward foreign exchange contracts, we have
    assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of
    counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The
    counterparties to these contracts are major multinational
    commercial banks, and we do not expect any losses as a result of
    counterparty defaults.



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We sell our products primarily to large organizations in
    different industries and geographies. We do not require
    collateral or other security to support accounts receivable. In
    addition, we maintain an allowance for potential credit losses.
    To reduce credit risk, we perform ongoing credit evaluations on
    our customers’ financial condition. We establish an
    allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding
    the credit risk of customers, historical trends and other
    information and, to date, such losses have been within
    management’s expectations. No customer represented more
    than 10% of accounts receivables in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007.
    Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts
    receivable are limited due to the wide variety of customers who
    are dispersed across many geographic regions.

Risk and Uncertainties

— There are no
    concentrations of business transacted with a particular market
    that would severely impact our business in the near term.
    However, we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for
    certain key components and a few key contract manufacturers to
    manufacture most of our products; any disruption or termination
    of these arrangements could materially adversely affect our
    operating results.

Comprehensive Income
    (Loss)

— Comprehensive income (loss) is
    defined as the change in equity during a period from nonowner
    sources. Comprehensive income consists of net income and other
    comprehensive income (loss), which is a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity. Other comprehensive income (loss)
    includes foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized
    gain, and losses on derivatives and unrealized gains and losses
    on our available-for-sale securities, which includes a temporary
    impairment charge of $7,037 and $3,500 in fiscal 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, associated with our auction rate securities. Refer
    to Note 3 for further discussion regarding this unrealized
    loss.

Other comprehensive income (loss) for fiscal years 2009, 2008
    and 2007 has been disclosed within the consolidated statement of
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income.

The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
    at the end of each fiscal year, were as follows (net of related
    tax effects):

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— We consider all
    highly liquid debt investments with original maturities of three
    months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Marketable Securities

— As of April 24,
    2009 and April 25, 2008, our short-term and long-term
    investments in marketable securities have been classified as
    “available-for-sale” and are carried at fair value.
    Available-for-sale investments with original maturities of
    greater than three months at the date of purchases are
    classified as short-term investments as these investments
    generally consist of highly marketable securities that are
    intended to be available to meet current cash requirements.
    Currently, all marketable securities held by us are classified
    as available-for-sale and our entire auction rate securities
    (ARS) portfolio and our investment in the Reserve Primary Fund
    (“Primary Fund”) are classified as long-term
    investments.

Our ARS are securities with long-term nominal maturities which,
    in accordance with investment policy guidelines, had credit
    ratings of AAA and Aaa at the time of purchase. During the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we reclassified all of our
    investments in ARS from short-term investments to long-term
    investments as we believed our ability to liquidate these
    investments in the next twelve months was uncertain. Based on an
    analysis of the fair value and marketability of these
    investments, we recorded temporary impairment charges of
    approximately $7,037 during fiscal 2009, partially offset by
    $296 in unrealized gains within other comprehensive income
    (loss). During fiscal



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss of
    $2,122 due to a significant decline in the estimated fair values
    of certain of our ARS related to credit quality risk and rating
    downgrades.

As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers, which
    occurred during fiscal 2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary
    impairment charge of $11,831 on our corporate bonds related to
    investments in Lehman Brothers securities and approximately
    $9,298 on our investments in the Primary Fund that held
    Lehman Brothers investments. As of April 24, 2009, we
    have an investment in the Primary Fund, an AAA-rated money
    market fund at the time of purchase, with a par value of $60,928
    and an estimated fair value of $51,630, which suspended
    redemptions in September 2008 and is in the process of
    liquidating its portfolio of investments. On December 3,
    2008, it announced a plan for liquidation and distribution of
    assets that includes the establishment of a special reserve to
    be set aside out of its assets for pending or threatened claims,
    as well as anticipated costs and expenses, including related
    legal and accounting fees. On February 26, 2009, the
    Primary Fund announced a plan to set aside $3,500,000 of the
    fund’s remaining assets as the “special reserve”
    which may be increased or decreased as further information
    becomes available. Our pro rata share of the $3,500,000 special
    reserve is approximately $41,455. The Primary Fund announced
    plans to continue to make periodic distributions, up to the
    amount of the special reserve, on a pro-rata basis. The Primary
    Fund has received an United States Security Exchange Commission
    order providing that the SEC will supervise the distribution of
    assets from the Primary Fund. We could realize additional losses
    in our holdings of the Primary Fund and may not receive all or a
    portion of our remaining balance in the Primary Fund as a result
    of market conditions and ongoing litigation against the fund.

During fiscal 2008 and 2007, recognized gains and losses on
    available-for-sale investments were not material. Management
    determines the appropriate classification of debt and equity
    securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the
    classification at each reporting date. The fair value of our
    marketable securities, including those included in long-term
    investments, was $1,228,220 and $543,226 as of April 24,
    2009 and April 25, 2008, respectively.

Investments in Nonpublic Companies

— We have
    certain investments in nonpublicly- traded companies in which we
    have less than 20% of the voting rights and in which we do not
    exercise significant influence and accordingly, we account for
    these investments under the cost method. As of April 24,
    2009 and April 25, 2008, $3,969 and $11,169 of these
    investments are included in long-term investments on the
    accompanying balance sheet. We perform periodic reviews of our
    investments for impairment. During fiscal 2009, we recorded a
    loss of $6,320 related to our investments in privately held
    companies.

Other-than-temporary Impairment

— All of our
    available-for-sale investments and nonmarketable equity
    securities are subject to a periodic impairment review.
    Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair
    value is judged to be other-than-temporary. This determination
    requires significant judgment. For publicly traded investments,
    impairment is determined based upon the specific facts and
    circumstances present at the time, including factors such as
    current economic and market conditions, the credit rating of the
    security’s issuer, the length of time an investment’s
    fair value has been below our carrying value, the extent to
    which fair value was below cost, and our ability and intent to
    hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for
    anticipated recovery in value. If an investment’s decline
    in fair value, caused by factors other than changes in interest
    rates, is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we reduce its
    carrying value to its estimated fair value, as determined based
    on quoted market prices or liquidation values. Declines in value
    judged to be other-than-temporary, if any, are recorded in
    operations as incurred. For long-term investments, such as
    auction rate securities, impairment is determined based on fair
    value and marketability of these investments. The valuation
    models we used to estimate fair value included numerous
    assumptions such as assessments of the underlying structure of
    each security, expected cash flows, discount rates, credit
    ratings, workout periods, and overall capital market liquidity.
    For nonmarketable equity securities, the impairment analysis
    requires the identification of events or circumstances that
    would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value
    of the investment, including revenue and earnings trends,
    overall business prospects, dilution of valuation due to new
    financing, limited capital resources, limited prospects of
    receiving additional



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

financing, limited prospects for liquidity of the related
    securities and general market conditions in the investees’
    industry.

Inventories

— Inventories are stated at the
    lower of cost or market, which approximates actual cost on a

first-in,

first out basis. We write down inventory and record purchase
    commitment liabilities for excess and obsolete inventory equal
    to the difference between the cost of inventory and the
    estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future demand
    and market conditions.

Property and Equipment

— Property and equipment
    are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets, which range from three to five years. The land at our
    Sunnyvale, California headquarters site and at Research Triangle
    Park, North Carolina, is not depreciated. Leasehold improvements
    are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of
    the assets or the remaining term of the lease. Buildings and
    building improvements are amortized over the estimated lives of
    the assets, which range from 10 to 40 years. Construction
    in progress will be amortized over the estimated useful lives of
    the respective assets when they are ready for their intended use.

We review the carrying values of long-lived assets whenever
    events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an
    asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows
    from its use and eventual disposition. The amount of impairment
    loss, if any, is measured as the difference between the net book
    value and the estimated fair value of the asset.

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets —

Goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for an
    acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and
    intangible assets acquired. Acquisition-related intangible
    assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
    economic lives of five years for patents, four to five years for
    existing technology, 18 months to eight years for customer
    relationships and two to seven years for trademarks and
    tradenames as we believe this method would most closely reflect
    the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets will be
    consumed.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets”,
    (“SFAS No. 142”) goodwill is measured and
    tested on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal
    year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment
    exist. Triggering events for impairment reviews may be
    indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends,
    restructuring actions, lower projections of profitability, or a
    sustained decline in our market capitalization. The performance
    of the test involves a two-step process. The first step requires
    comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book
    value, including goodwill. We have one reporting unit, the fair
    value of which is determined to equal our market capitalization
    as determined through quoted market prices. A potential
    impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is
    lower than its net book value. The second step of the process is
    only performed if a potential impairment exists, and it involves
    determining the difference between the fair value of the
    reporting unit’s net assets other than goodwill to the fair
    value of the reporting unit and if the difference is less than
    the net book value of goodwill an impairment exists and is
    recorded. We have not been required to perform this second step
    of the process since its adoption of SFAS No. 142
    because the fair value of the reporting unit has exceeded the
    net book value at every measurement date.

Long-Lived Assets —

We account for
    long-lived assets, including other purchased intangible assets
    acquired in business combinations, in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144, “

Accounting for the Impairment
    or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

”,
    (“SFAS No. 144”), which requires impairment
    losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations
    when indicators of impairment, such as reductions in demand,
    lower projections of profitability, significant changes in the
    manner of our use of acquired assets, or significant negative
    industry or economic trends are present. Reviews are performed
    to determine whether the carrying value of an asset is impaired,
    based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows.
    If this comparison indicates that there is impairment, the
    impaired asset is written down to fair value, which is typically
    calculated using: (i) quoted market prices

and/or

(ii) discounted expected future cash flows utilizing a
    discount rate consistent with the guidance provided in FASB
    Concepts Statement No. 7, “

Using Cash Flow
    Information and Present Value in Accounting
    Measurements

”.



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over
    the fair value of those assets. We estimate regarding future
    anticipated net revenue and cash flows, the remaining economic
    life of the products and technologies, or both, may differ from
    those used to assess the recoverability of assets. In that
    event, impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain
    long-lived assets may be required, resulting in a reduction in
    net income or an increase to net loss in the period when such
    determinations are made. Due to the recent negative economic
    trends, we tested our long-lived assets for impairment as of
    April 24, 2009 and determined they were not impaired,
    except for an impairment charge of intangibles of $14,917 in
    fiscal 2009 related to our decision to cease development and
    availability of a certain product.

Revenue Recognition

— We apply the provisions
    of Statement of Position (“SOP”)

No. 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,”

and related
    interpretations to our product sales, both hardware and
    software, because our software is essential to the performance
    of our hardware. We recognize revenue when:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists:

It is our customary practice to have a
    purchase order

and/or

contract prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement from our
    end users, customers, value-added resellers, or distributors.

•

Delivery has occurred:

Our product is
    physically delivered to our customers, generally with standard
    transfer terms such as FOB origin. We typically do not allow for
    restocking rights with any of our value- added resellers or
    distributors. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or
    return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria
    are achieved. If undelivered products or services exist that are
    essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an
    arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred.

•

The fee is fixed or determinable:

Arrangements
    with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms,
    conditions, and practices are not considered to be fixed or
    determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized as
    the fees become due and payable. We typically do not allow for
    price-protection rights with any of our value-added resellers or
    distributors.

•

Collection is probable:

Probability of
    collection is assessed on a

customer-by-customer

basis. Customers are subjected to a credit review process that
    evaluates the customers’ financial position and ultimately
    their ability to pay. If it is determined at the outset of an
    arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our
    review process, revenue is recognized upon cash receipt.

Our multiple element arrangements include our systems and one or
    more of the following undelivered software-related elements:
    software entitlements and maintenance, premium hardware
    maintenance, and storage review services. Our software
    entitlements and maintenance entitle our customers to receive
    unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a

when-and-if-available

basis, bug fixes, and patch releases. Premium hardware
    maintenance services include contracts for technical support and
    minimum response times. Revenues from software entitlements and
    maintenance, premium hardware maintenance services and storage
    review services are recognized ratably over the contractual
    term, generally from one to three years. We also offer extended
    service contracts (which extend our standard parts warranty and
    may include premium hardware maintenance) at the end of the
    warranty term; revenues from these contracts are recognized
    ratably over the contract term. We typically sell technical
    consulting services separately from any of our other revenue
    elements, either on a time and materials basis or for fixed
    price standard projects; we recognize revenue for these services
    as they are performed. Revenue from hardware installation
    services is recognized at the time of delivery and any remaining
    costs are accrued, as the remaining undelivered services are
    considered to be inconsequential and perfunctory. For
    arrangements with multiple elements, we recognize as revenue the
    difference between the total arrangement price and the greater
    of fair value or stated price for any undelivered elements
    (“the residual method”).

For our undelivered software-related elements, we apply the
    provisions of

SOP No. 97-2

and determine fair value of these undelivered elements based on
    vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”), which for
    us consists of the prices charged when these services are sold
    separately either alone, in the case of software entitlements
    and maintenance, or as a bundled element which always includes
    software entitlements and maintenance and premium



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

hardware maintenance, and may also include storage review
    services. To determine the fair value of these elements, we
    analyze both the selling prices when elements are sold
    separately as well as the concentrations of those prices. We
    believe those concentrations have been sufficient to enable us
    to establish VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements. If
    VSOE cannot be obtained to establish fair value of the
    undelivered elements, paragraph 12 of

SOP No. 97-2

would require that revenue from the entire arrangement be
    initially deferred and recognized ratably over the period these
    elements are delivered.

For purposes of presentation in the statement of operations,
    once fair value has been determined for our undelivered bundled
    elements, we allocate revenue first to software entitlements and
    maintenance, based on VSOE of its fair value with the remainder
    allocated to other service revenues.

We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at
    the time of shipment. Sales returns are estimated based on
    historical sales returns, current trends, and our expectations
    regarding future experience. We monitor and analyze the accuracy
    of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and
    adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of
    our current and future reserve needs. If actual future returns
    and allowances differ from past experience, additional
    allowances may be required.

We also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for
    estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility
    of specific customer accounts and the aging of our accounts
    receivable. We analyze accounts receivable and historical bad
    debts, customer concentrations, customer solvency, current
    economic and geographic trends, and changes in customer payment
    terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of the
    allowance for doubtful accounts. Our allowance for doubtful
    accounts as of April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, was
    $3,068, and $2,439, respectively. If the financial condition of
    our customers deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their
    ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

Deferred Revenues

— Deferred revenues consist
    primarily of amounts related to software entitlements and
    maintenance, service contracts and other service described in
    revenue recognition above.

Software Development Costs

— The costs for the
    development of new software products and substantial
    enhancements to existing software products are expensed as
    incurred until technological feasibility has been established,
    at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in
    accordance with SFAS No. 86,

“Accounting for
    the Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
    Marketed.”

Because we believe our current process for
    developing software is essentially completed concurrently with
    the establishment of technological feasibility, which occurs
    upon the completion of a working model, no costs have been
    capitalized for any of the periods presented. In accordance with

SOP No. 98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed
    or Obtained for Internal Use,”

the cost of internally
    developed software is capitalized and included in property and
    equipment at the point at which the conceptual formulation,
    design, and testing of possible software project alternatives
    have been completed and management authorizes and commits to
    funding the project. Projects where expected future economic
    benefits are less than probable are not capitalized. Internally
    developed software costs include the cost of software tools and
    licenses used in the development of our systems, as well as
    consulting costs. Completed projects are transferred to property
    and equipment at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis
    over their estimated useful lives, generally three years. We did
    not capitalize any software development costs in fiscal 2009,
    2008 or 2007.

Income Taxes

— Deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities are provided for temporary differences that will
    result in future tax deductions or income in future periods, as
    well as the future benefit of tax credit carryforwards. A
    valuation allowance reduces tax assets to their estimated
    realizable value.

Determining the liability for uncertain tax positions requires
    us to make significant estimates and judgments as to whether,
    and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due based on
    potential tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax
    jurisdictions throughout the world. Our estimates are based on
    the outcomes of previous audits, as well as the precedents set
    in cases in which others have taken similar tax positions to
    those taken by us. If we later determine



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not
    sufficient to cover our revised expectations, we adjust the
    liability and effect a related change in our tax provision
    during the period in which we make such a determination.

Effective April 28, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
    (“FIN”) No. 48,

“Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109.”

FIN No. 48
    prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should
    recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial
    statements uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect
    to take on a tax return (including a decision whether to file or
    not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction).
    FIN No. 48 is applicable to all uncertain tax
    positions for taxes accounted for under SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income Taxes,”

and
    substantially changes the applicable accounting model. There was
    no cumulative effect from the adoption of FIN No. 48.
    As a result of the implementation of FIN No. 48, we
    recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions
    on the income tax return based on the two-step process
    prescribed in the interpretation. The first step is to determine
    whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position
    would be sustained upon audit. The second step is to estimate
    and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater
    than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement
    with the tax authority. Estimating these amounts requires us to
    determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We
    evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. See
    “Note 6, Income Taxes,” for further discussion.

Foreign Currency Translation

— For subsidiaries
    whose functional currency is the local currency, gains and
    losses resulting from translation of these foreign currency
    financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded within
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income as part of
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries
    where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, gains and
    losses resulting from the process of remeasuring foreign
    currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are
    included in other income (expenses), net.

Derivative Instruments

— We follow
    SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”

as amended.
    Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to
    fair value through earnings. If the derivative is designated as
    a hedge, depending on the nature of the exposure being hedged,
    changes in fair value will either be offset against the change
    in fair value of the hedged items through earnings or recognized
    within stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss)
    until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective
    portion of the hedge is recognized in earnings immediately. For
    all periods presented, realized gains and losses on the
    ineffective portion of our hedges were not material.

As a result of our significant international operations, we are
    subject to risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates. We
    use derivative financial instruments, principally currency
    forward contracts and currency options, to attempt to minimize
    the impact of exchange rate movements on our balance sheet and
    operating results. Factors that could have an impact on the
    effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of
    forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets. These
    programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the
    impact of currency exchange movements. The maturities of these
    instruments are generally less than one year.

Currently, we do not enter into any foreign exchange forward
    contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments or
    nonmarketable investments.

Net Income per Share

— Basic net income per
    share is computed by dividing income available to common
    stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding, excluding common shares subject to repurchase for
    that period. Diluted net income per share is computed giving
    effect to all dilutive potential shares that were outstanding
    during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of
    incremental common shares subject to repurchase and common
    shares issuable upon exercise of stock options, employee stock
    purchase plan (“ESPP”), warrants, and restricted stock
    awards.

Certain awards outstanding, representing 61,050, 39,302, and
    22,827 shares of common stock, have been excluded from the
    diluted net income per share calculations for fiscal 2009, 2008
    and 2007, respectively, because their effect would have been
    antidilutive as these options’ exercise prices were above
    the average market prices in



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

such periods. Diluted shares outstanding do not include any
    effect resulting from the conversion of our Notes issued in June
    2008, warrants and ESPP shares as their impact would be
    anti-dilutive for all periods presented.

As of April 24, 2009, we have repurchased
    104,325 shares of our common stock under various stock
    repurchase programs since inception of the repurchase programs
    in May 2003. Such repurchased shares are held as treasury stock
    and our outstanding shares used to calculate earnings per share
    have been reduced by the weighted number of repurchased shares.

The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and
    denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share

Stock-Based Compensation

— We account for
    stock-based compensation expense in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123R,

“Share

-

Based
    Payment”

(“SFAS No. 123R”), which
    requires us to measure and recognize compensation expense for
    all stock-based payments awards, including employee stock
    options, restricted stock units and rights to purchase shares
    under our ESPP, based on their estimated fair value, and to
    recognize the costs in our financial statements over the
    employees’ requisite service period. Total stock-based
    compensation expense recognized in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007
    was $140,754, $147,964 and $163,033, respectively.

The fair value of employee restricted stock units is equal to
    the market value of our common stock on the date the award is
    granted. Calculating the fair value of employee stock options
    and the rights to purchase shares under the ESPP requires
    estimates and significant judgment. We use the Black-Scholes
    option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these awards,
    consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. The
    fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and is not
    remeasured as a result of subsequent stock price fluctuations.
    Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective
    assumptions, including the expected term of options, the
    expected price volatility of the stock underlying such options
    and forfeiture rate. Our expected term assumption is based
    primarily on historical exercise and post-vesting forfeiture
    experience. Our stock price volatility assumption is based on an
    implied volatility of call options and dealer quotes on call
    options, generally having a term of greater than twelve months.
    Changes in the subjective assumptions required in the valuation
    models may significantly affect the estimated value of our
    stock-based awards, the related stock-based compensation expense
    and, consequently, our results of operations. Likewise, the
    shortening of the



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

contractual life of our options could change the estimated
    exercise behavior in a manner other than currently expected.

In addition, SFAS 123R requires that we estimate the number
    of stock-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee
    turnover. Our forfeiture assumption is based primarily on
    historical experience. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate
    can have a significant effect on reported stock-based
    compensation expense, as the effect of adjusting the rate for
    all expense amortization after April 28, 2006 is recognized
    in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If the actual
    forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate,
    then an adjustment will be made to increase the estimated
    forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense
    recognized in the financial statements. If the actual forfeiture
    rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an
    adjustment will be made to lower the estimated forfeiture rate,
    which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in
    our financial statements. The expense we recognize in future
    periods will be affected by changes in the estimated forfeiture
    rate and may differ significantly from amounts recognized in the
    current period

and/or

our
    forecasts.

and APB

No. 28-1

are effective in reporting periods ending after June 15,
    2009, and are required to be adopted by us beginning in the

FSP

FAS No. 115-2

and

No. 124-2

amends the other-than-temporary impairment guidance for debt
    securities. Under FSP

FAS No. 115-2

and

No. 124-2,

the pre-existing “intent and ability” trigger was
    modified such that an other-than-temporary impairment is now
    triggered when there is intent to sell the security, it is more
    likely than not that the security will be required to be sold
    before recovery in value, or the security is not expected to
    recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Credit
    related losses on debt securities will be considered an
    other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings, and any
    other losses due to a decline in fair value relative to the
    amortized cost deemed not to be other-than-temporary will be
    recorded in other comprehensive income. FSP

FAS No. 115-2

and

No. 124-2

are effective in reporting periods ending after June 15,
    2009, and are required to be adopted by our beginning in the
    first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are currently evaluating the
    impact of the adoption of FSP

FAS No. 115-2

, in the current economic environment and
    reemphasizes that the objective of a fair value measurement
    remains the determination of an exit price. If we were to
    conclude that there has been a significant decrease in the
    volume and level of activity of the asset or liability in
    relation to normal market activities, quoted market values may
    not be representative of fair value and we may conclude that a
    change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation
    techniques may be appropriate. We do not expect the adoption of
    FSP

FAS No. 157-4

will have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    statements.

In January 2009, the FASB issued FSP EITF

No. 99-20-1,

“Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue

No. 99-20

”
    (“FSP EITF

No. 99-20-1”).

FSP EITF

No. 99-20-1

amends the impairment guidance under

EITF 99-20

to be consistent with guidance under FASB No. 115. FSP EITF

No. 99-20-1

removes the reference to market participants when a company
    determines impairment of a security under the expected future
    cash flows. FSP EITF

No. 99-20-1

requires the company to recognize other-than temporary
    impairment as a realized loss through earnings when it is
    probable that there has been an adverse change in estimated cash
    flows from the cash flows previously projected. The company must
    also consider all available information when developing the
    estimate of future cash flows. This FSP was effective for
    interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2008.
    The adoption of FSP EITF

No. 99-20-1

did not have a material impact on our financial position or
    results of operations.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. 157-3,

“Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When
    the Market for That Asset Is Not Active”

(“FSP

clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157,

“Fair Value Measurements,”

which we adopted as
    of July 26, 2008, in situations where the market is not
    active. We have considered the guidance provided by FSP

No. 157-3

in our determination of estimated fair values as of
    April 24, 2009, and the impact was not material.

In September 2008, the FASB issued FSP

In June 2008, the FASB issued EITF Issue

No. 07-5,

“Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature)

In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB

No. 14-1,

“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash Upon Conversion”

(“FSP APB

No. 14-1”.)

FSP APB

No. 14-1

requires that the liability and equity components of convertible
    debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion
    (including partial cash settlement) be separately accounted for
    in a manner that reflects an issuer’s non-convertible debt
    borrowing rate. Upon adoption of FSP APB

No. 14-1,

we will be required to allocate a portion of the proceeds
    received from the June 2008 issuance of our convertible notes
    between a liability component and equity component by
    determining the fair value of the liability component using our
    non-convertible debt borrowing rate. The difference between the
    proceeds of the notes and the fair value of the liability
    component will be recorded as a discount on our convertible
    notes with a corresponding offset to paid-in capital (the equity
    component). The resulting discount will be accreted by recording
    additional non-cash interest expense over the expected life of
    the convertible notes using the effective interest rate method.
    Although the adoption of FSP APB

No. 14-1

will have no impact on our past or future cash flows, it will
    require us to record a significant amount of non-cash interest
    expense as the debt discount is amortized. We will adopt FSP APB

No. 14-1

in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. FSP APB

No. 14-1

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years, and must be applied on a
    retrospective basis. Accordingly, commencing with the filing of
    our Quarterly Report on

Form 10-Q

for the quarter ended July 31, 2009, our historical
    financial statements will be adjusted to give effect to FSP APB

No. 14-1.

Due to the retrospective application, the notes will reflect a
    lower principal balance and additional non-cash interest expense
    based on our non-convertible debt borrowing rate. We estimate
    that the retrospective adoption of FSP APB

No. 14-1

will reduce fiscal 2009 convertible long-term debt by
    approximately $221,000, increase stockholders’ equity by
    approximately $157,000 as of April 24, 2009, and that it
    will increase non-cash interest expense and decrease income
    before income taxes by approximately $39,000, decrease net
    income by approximately $15,800, and reduce both basic and
    diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.05 for fiscal
    2009. Further, we expect to incur related non-cash interest
    expense of approximately $46,000 for fiscal 2010. Upon adoption
    of FSP APB

No. 14-1,

we will record certain deferred tax liabilities relating to the
    debt discount which can be offset against deferred tax assets
    related to our Note Hedge.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets”

(“FSP

No. 142-3”).

FSP

No. 142-3

amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible asset under
    SFAS No. 142, “

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

”. The intent of the position is to improve the
    consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible
    asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of expected
    cash flows used to measure the fair value of the intangible
    asset. FSP

No. 142-3

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. The adoption FSP

No. 142-3

may impact any intangibles the Company acquires in future
    transactions.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

“Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — An Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133”

(“SFAS No. 161”).
    SFAS No. 161 requires additional disclosures about the
    objectives of using derivative instruments, the method by which
    the derivative instruments and related hedged items are
    accounted for under FASB Statement No. 133 and its related
    interpretations, and the effect of derivative instruments and
    related hedged items on financial position, financial
    performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 also
    requires disclosure of the fair value of derivative instruments
    and their gains and losses in a tabular format. This statement
    was effective for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Since
    SFAS No. 161 only requires additional disclosure, the
    adoption of SFAS No. 161 did not have a material
    impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. 157-1,

“Application of FASB Statement 157 to FASB Statement 13
    and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value
    Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement
    under Statement 13”

(“FSP

No. 157-1”),

and FSP

No. 157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement 157”

(“FSP

No. 157-2”).

FSP

No. 157-1

amends SFAS No. 157 to remove certain leasing
    transactions from its scope. FSP

No. 157-2

delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all
    non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for
    items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
    financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually),
    until the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal year 2010. We
    are currently

evaluating the impact that the application of SFAS 157 to
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities may have on our
    consolidated financial statements. Our significant nonfinancial
    assets and nonfinancial liabilities that may be impacted by the
    adoption of FAS 157 include goodwill, intangible assets,
    long-lived assets and restructuring liabilities.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),

“Business Combinations”

(“SFAS No. 141(R)”).
    SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and
    requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination
    recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
    identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date
    fair value. SFAS No. 141(R) determines what
    information to disclose to enable users of the financial
    statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the
    business combination. We are required to adopt
    SFAS No. 141(R) at the beginning of the first quarter
    of fiscal 2010, which begins on April 25, 2009. The
    adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will change our accounting
    treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis
    beginning April 25, 2009. The impact that SFAS 141R
    has on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows will be dependent on the number and
    size of business combinations that we consummate subsequent to
    the adoption of the standard, as well as the valuation and
    allocation of the net assets acquired.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an Amendment of ARB No. 51”

(“SFAS No. 160”). SFAS No. 160
    will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests,
    which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and
    classified as a component of equity. This new consolidation
    method will significantly change the accounting for transactions
    with minority interest holders. We are required to adopt
    SFAS No. 160 at the beginning of our first quarter of
    fiscal 2010, which begins on April 25, 2009. We do not
    expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 to have a material
    impact on our financial position or result of operations.

The unrealized losses on our investments in corporate bonds,
    U.S. government agency bonds and corporate securities were
    caused by market value declines as a result of the recent
    economic environment, as well as fluctuations in market interest
    rates. We believe that we will be able to collect all principal
    and interest amounts due to us at maturity given the high credit
    quality of these investments. Because the decline in market
    value is attributable to changes in market conditions and not
    credit quality, and because we have the ability and intent to
    hold those investments until a recovery of par value, we do not
    consider these investments to be other-than temporarily impaired
    at April 24, 2009.

Our investments include direct and indirect investments in
    Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc.
    (“Lehman Brothers”) securities. As of
    April 24, 2009, our short-term investments include
    corporate bonds issued by Lehman Brothers, while our long-term
    investments include the Reserve Primary Fund (“Primary
    Fund”), which held Lehman Brothers investments. As a result
    of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers, we recorded an
    other-than-temporary impairment charge of $21,129 in fiscal 2009
    related to Lehman Brothers corporate bonds and the Primary Fund
    that held Lehman Brothers investments.

Our long-term investments also include auction rate securities
    (“ARS”) with a fair value of $66,537 and $72,702 at
    April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, respectively.
    Substantially all of our ARS are backed by pools of student
    loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education. These
    ARS are securities with long-term nominal maturities which, in
    accordance with our investment policy guidelines, had credit
    ratings of AAA and Aaa at the time of purchase. During the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we reclassified all of our
    investments in auction rate securities from short-term
    investments to long-term investments as our ability to liquidate
    these investments in the next twelve months is uncertain. Based
    on an analysis of the fair value and marketability of these
    investments, we recorded temporary impairment charges of
    approximately $7,037 as of April 24, 2009, partially offset
    by $296 in unrealized gains within other comprehensive income
    (loss). During fiscal 2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary
    impairment loss of $2,122 due to a significant decline in the
    estimated fair values of certain of our ARS related to credit
    quality risk and rating downgrades.

Convertible
    Notes and Credit Facilities

1.75% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due 2013

Principal Amount

— On June 10, 2008, we
    issued $1,265,000 aggregate principal amount of
    1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the
    “Notes”) to initial purchasers who resold the Notes to
    qualified institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A
    under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The net proceeds
    from the offering, after deducting the initial purchasers’
    issue costs and offering expenses of $26,581, were $1,238,419.

Ranking and Interest —

The Notes are unsecured,
    unsubordinated obligations of NetApp. Interest is payable in
    cash at a rate of 1.75% per annum. We capitalized issuance costs
    related to the Notes of $26,581, which are included in long-term
    other assets and are being amortized as interest expense over
    the term of the Notes using the effective interest method.

Maturity —

The Notes will mature on
    June 1, 2013 unless repurchased or converted earlier in
    accordance with their terms prior to such date.

Redemption—

The Notes are not redeemable by us
    prior to the maturity date, but the holders may require us to
    repurchase the Notes following a “fundamental change”
    (as defined in the Indenture). A fundamental change will be
    deemed to have occurred upon a change of control, liquidation or
    a termination of trading. Holders of the Notes who convert their
    Notes in connection with a fundamental change will, under
    certain circumstances, be entitled to a make-whole premium in
    the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in
    the event of a fundamental change, holders of the Notes may
    require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes at a
    repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
    Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not
    including, the fundamental change repurchase date.

Conversion —

Holders of the Notes may convert
    their Notes on or after March 1, 2013 until the close of
    business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the
    maturity date. Upon conversion, we will satisfy our conversion
    obligation by delivering cash and shares of our common stock, if
    any, based on a daily settlement amount. Prior to March 1,
    2013, holders of the Notes may convert their Notes, under any of
    the following conditions:

•

during the five business day period after any five consecutive
    trading day period in which the trading price of the Notes for
    each day in this five consecutive trading day period was less
    than 98% of an amount equal to (i) the last reported sale
    price of Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the conversion
    rate on such day;



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

during any calendar quarter beginning after June 30, 2008
    (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported
    sale price of Common Stock for 20 or more trading days in a
    period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
    day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130%
    of the applicable conversion price in effect for the Notes on
    the last trading day of such immediately preceding calendar
    quarter; or

•

upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions under
    the indenture for the Notes.

The Notes are convertible into the right to receive cash in an
    amount up to the principal amount and shares of our common stock
    for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, if
    any, at an initial conversion rate of 31.4006 shares of
    common stock per one thousand principal amount of Notes, subject
    to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the Notes,
    which represents an initial conversion price of $31.85 per share.

Note
    Hedges and Warrants

Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into note
    hedge transactions (the “Note Hedges”), which are
    designed to mitigate potential dilution from the conversion of
    the Notes in the event that the market value per share of our
    common stock at the time of exercise is greater than $31.85 per
    share, subject to adjustments. The Note Hedges generally cover,
    subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the net shares of our
    common stock that would be deliverable to converting Noteholders
    in the event of a conversion of the Notes. The Note Hedges
    expire at the earlier of (i) the last day on which any
    Notes remain outstanding and (ii) the scheduled trading day
    immediately preceding the maturity date of the Notes. We also
    entered into separate warrant transactions whereby we sold to
    the same financial institutions warrants (the
    “Warrants”) to acquire, subject to anti-dilution
    adjustments, 39,700 shares of our common stock at an
    exercise price of $41.28 per share, subject to adjustment, on a
    series of days commencing on September 3, 2013. Upon
    exercise of the Warrants, we have the option to deliver cash or
    shares of our common stock equal to the difference between the
    then market price and the strike price of the Warrants. As of
    April 24, 2009, we had not received any shares related to
    the Note Hedges or delivered cash or shares related to the
    Warrants.

If the market value per share of our common stock at the time of
    conversion of the Notes is above the strike price of the Note
    Hedges, the Note Hedges will generally entitle us to receive net
    shares of our common stock (and cash for any fractional share
    amount) based on the excess of the then current market price of
    our common stock over the strike price of the Note Hedges, which
    is designed to offset any shares that we may have to deliver to
    the Noteholders. Additionally, at the time of exercise of the
    Warrants, if the market price of our common stock exceeds the
    strike price of the Warrants, we will owe the option
    counterparties net shares of our common stock (and cash for any
    fractional share amount) or cash in an amount based on the
    excess of the then current market price of our common stock over
    the strike price of the Warrants.

The cost of the Note Hedges was $254,898, or $152,200 net
    of deferred tax benefits, and has been accounted for as an
    equity transaction in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”)

No. 00-19,

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
    to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock”

(EITF No. 00- 19).

We received proceeds of $163,059 related to the sale of the
    Warrants, which has also been classified as equity because the
    instruments meet all of the equity classification criteria
    within EITF

No. 00-19.

Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives, Inc. (“Lehman OTC”)
    is the counterparty to 20% of our Note Hedges. The bankruptcy
    filing by Lehman OTC on October 3, 2008 constituted an
    “event of default” under the hedge transaction that
    could, at our option, lead to termination under the hedge
    transaction to the extent we provide notice to the counterparty
    under such transaction. We have not terminated the Note Hedge
    transaction with Lehman OTC, and will continue to carefully
    monitor the developments impacting Lehman OTC. The “event
    of default” is not expected to have an impact on our
    financial position or results of operations. However, we could
    incur significant costs to replace this hedge transaction
    originally held with Lehman OTC if we elect to do so. If we do
    not elect to replace this hedge transaction, then we would be
    subject to potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes, if
    on the date of conversion the per-share market price of our
    common stock exceeds the conversion price of $31.85.



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The terms of the Notes, the rights of the holders of the Notes
    and other counterparties to Note Hedges and Warrants were not
    affected by the bankruptcy filings of Lehman OTC.

Earnings per share impact on the Notes, Note Hedges and
    Warrants —

In accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 128,
    the Notes will have no impact on diluted earnings per share
    unless the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion
    price (initially $31.85 per share) because the principal amount
    of the Notes will be settled in cash upon conversion. The Note
    Hedges are not included for purposes of calculating earnings per
    share for fiscal 2009, as their effect would be anti-dilutive.
    Upon conversion of the Notes, the Note Hedges are designed to
    neutralize the dilutive effect of the Notes when the stock price
    is above $31.85 per share. Also, in accordance with
    SFAS No. 128, the Warrants will have no impact on
    earnings per share until our common stock share price exceeds
    $41.28. Prior to conversion of the Notes or exercise of the Note
    Hedges, we will include the effect of additional shares that may
    be issued if our common stock price exceeds the conversion
    price, using the treasury stock method.

Unsecured
    Credit Agreement

On November 2, 2007, we entered into a senior unsecured
    credit agreement (the “Unsecured Credit Agreement”)
    with certain lenders and BNP Paribas (“BNP”), as
    syndication agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank National Association
    (“JPMorgan”), as administrative agent. The Unsecured
    Credit Agreement provides for a revolving unsecured credit
    facility that is comprised of commitments from various lenders
    who agree to make revolving loans and swingline loans and issue
    letters of credit of up to an aggregate amount of $250,000 with
    a term of five years. Revolving loans may be, at our option,
    Alternative Base Rate borrowings or Eurodollar borrowings.
    Interest on Eurodollar borrowings accrues at a floating rate
    based on LIBOR for the interest period specified by us plus a
    spread based on our leverage ratio. Interest on Alternative Base
    Rate borrowings, swingline loans, and letters of credit accrues
    at a rate based on the Prime Rate in effect on such day. The
    proceeds of the loans may be used for our general corporate
    purposes, including stock repurchases and working capital needs.
    As of April 24, 2009, no amount was outstanding under this
    facility. The amounts allocated under the Unsecured Credit
    Agreement to support certain of our outstanding letters of
    credit amounted to $638 as of April 24, 2009. As of
    April 24, 2009, we were in compliance with all covenants as
    required by the Unsecured Credit Agreement.

Secured
    Credit Agreement

On October 5, 2007, we entered into a secured credit
    agreement (the “Secured Credit Agreement”). The
    Secured Credit Agreement provided for a revolving secured credit
    facility of up to $250,000 with a term of five years. As of
    April 25, 2008, the outstanding balance on the Secured
    Credit Agreement was $172,600, which was recorded as Revolving
    Credit Facilities in the consolidated balance sheets, and was
    secured with $242,613 of long-term restricted investments
    pledged in connection with this agreement. During fiscal 2009,
    we terminated the Secured Credit Agreement. No borrowings were
    outstanding at the time of termination and no penalties resulted
    from the early termination.

Loan
    Agreement

On March 31, 2006, NetApp Global LTD. (“Global”),
    a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a loan agreement (the
    “Loan Agreement”). The Loan Agreement provided for an
    aggregate borrowings of $300,000. The Loan Agreement was fully
    repaid as of April 25, 2008.

Foreign
    Exchange Facilities

We also have foreign exchange facilities used for hedging
    arrangements with several banks that allow us to enter into
    foreign exchange contracts of up to $600,000, of which $317,210
    was available at April 24, 2009.

Equity
    Incentive Programs

Stock Incentive Plans

—

The 1995 Plan

— The 1995 Stock Incentive Plan
    (“the 1995 Plan”) expired on August 31, 2008, and
    no further grants may be made from the plan.

Options granted under the 1995 Plan generally vested at a rate
    of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date
    and then ratably over the following 36 months. Options
    expired as determined by the Board of Directors, but not more
    than 10 years after the date of grant. The 1999 Plan
    supplements the 1995 Plan.

The Nonofficer Plan

— In April 1997, the Board
    of Directors adopted the Special Nonofficer Stock Option Plan
    (“the Nonofficer Plan”) which provides for the grant
    of options and the issuance of common stock under terms
    substantially the same as those provided under the 1995 Plan,
    except that the Nonofficer Plan allows only for the issuance of
    nonqualified options to nonofficer employees. The Nonofficer
    Plan expired on December 31, 2007, and no further grants
    may be made from the plan.

The 1999 Plan

— As amended through
    April 24, 2009, the 1999 Stock Option Plan (“the 1999
    Plan”) comprises five separate equity incentive programs:
    (i) the Discretionary Option Grant Program under which
    options may be granted to eligible individuals during the
    service period at a fixed price per share; (ii) the Stock
    Appreciation Rights Program under which eligible persons may be
    granted stock appreciation rights that allow individuals to
    receive the appreciation in Fair Market Value of the shares;
    (iii) the Stock Issuance Program under which eligible
    individuals may be issued shares of Common Stock directly;
    (iv) the Performance Share and Performance Unit Program
    (also known as restricted stock units or RSUs) under which
    eligible persons may be granted performance shares and
    performance units which result in payment to the participant
    only if performance goals or other vesting criteria are
    achieved; and (v) the Automatic Option Grant Program under
    which nonemployee board members automatically receive option
    grants at designated intervals over their period of board
    service.

Under the 1999 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant to
    employees, nonemployee directors, and consultants and other
    independent advisors options to purchase shares of our common
    stock during their period of service with us. The exercise price
    for an incentive stock option and a nonstatutory option cannot
    be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock
    on the grant date. Options granted under the 1999 Plan generally
    vest over a four-year period. Options granted prior to
    April 29, 2006, have a term of no more than 10 years
    after the date of grant and those granted after April 29,
    2006 have a term of no more than seven years, subject to earlier
    termination upon the occurrence of certain events. The 1999 Plan
    prohibits the repricing of any outstanding stock option or stock
    appreciation right after it has been granted or to cancel any
    outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right and
    immediately replace it with a new stock option or stock
    appreciation right with a lower exercise price unless approved
    by stockholders. Restricted stock units granted under the 1999
    Plan generally vest over a four-year period with 25% of the
    units vesting on each annual anniversary of the grant date. The
    1999 Plan limits the percentage of Stock Issuance and
    Performance Shares or Performance Units that may be granted
    under the Plan to 30% of the shares reserved; limits the value
    of performance units a participant may receive during any
    calendar year to $2,000. The 1999 Plan expires on August 2019.

Acquisition Plans

— In fiscal 2008, we assumed
    a stock incentive plan in connection with our acquisition of
    Onaro (see Note 11). Under the terms of the merger
    agreement, options and restricted stock units to purchase
    1,000 shares were exchanged at certain exchange ratios. The
    options granted under this plan generally vest at a rate of 25%
    on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and
    then ratably over the following 36 months. The restricted
    stock units generally vest at a rate of 50% on the first and
    second annual anniversaries of the vesting commencement date.



NETAPP,

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In fiscal 2007, we assumed two stock incentive plans in
    connection with our acquisition of Topio (see Note 11.)
    Under the terms of the merger agreement, options and restricted
    stock units to purchase 858 shares were exchanged at
    certain exchange ratios. The options granted under these plans
    generally vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the
    vesting commencement date and then ratably over the following
    36 months. The restricted stock units generally vest at a
    rate of 50% on the first and second annual anniversaries of the
    vesting commencement date.

In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, 1999 Plan was amended to increase
    the share reserved by an additional 6,600, 7,200, and
    10,900 shares for issuance under the plan, respectively. As
    of April 24, 2009, 17,822 shares were available for
    grant under our equity incentive plans.

Stock Option Exchange Program

— On
    April 21, 2009, our stockholders approved a stock option
    exchange program pursuant to which eligible employees would be
    able to exchange some or all of their outstanding options with
    an exercise price greater or equal to $22.00 per share that were
    granted before June 20, 2008, whether vested or unvested,
    for new RSUs. The number of RSUs that will be granted in
    exchange for the options will depend on the exercise price of
    the options exchanged. The vesting schedule of the RSUs will be
    determined on a

grant-by-grant

basis and will depend on the extent to which the options
    surrendered in exchange for such RSUs have vested at the time of
    such exchange and, for surrendered options that are fully
    vested, the exercise price. Vesting of the RSUs will be
    conditioned upon continued service with us through each
    applicable vesting date. On May 22, 2009, we commenced the
    option exchange program, which unless extended by us, will
    expire on June 19, 2009. For more information, please see
    our tender offer statement on Schedule TO, as filed with
    the SEC on May 22, 2009, as may be amended from time to
    time.

Stock Issuance Program

— Under the 1999 Stock
    Issuance Program, certain eligible persons may be issued shares
    of common stock directly. No restricted stock award was issued
    to employees during fiscal 2009 and 2008. During fiscal 2007,
    125 shares of restricted stock awards were issued to
    certain employees. At April 24, 2009, 5,446 shares
    were available for future issuances under this program.

Although nonvested shares are legally issued, they are

    by the Company when employees terminate their employment. The
    total fair value of shares vested during fiscal 2009, 2008 and
    2007 was $1,987, $1,632, and $3,135, respectively. There was
    $2,530 of total unrecognized compensation expense as of
    April 24, 2009 related to restricted stock awards. The
    unrecognized compensation expense will be amortized on a
    straight-line basis over a weighted-average remaining period of
    1.3 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

— Under the ESPP,
    employees are entitled to purchase shares of our common stock at
    85% of the fair market value at certain specified dates over a
    two-year period. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, the plan was
    amended to increase the share reserved by an additional 2,900,
    1,600 and 1,600 shares of common stock, respectively. The
    weighted average fair value of purchase rights granted under the
    ESPP during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $6.17, $7.44, and
    $7.94, respectively. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, 3,333,
    2,057, and 1,632 shares, respectively, were issued under
    the ESPP at a weighted average price of $14.96, $23.38, and
    $22.78 respectively. Of the 23,500 shares authorized to be
    issued under this plan, 3,376 shares were available for
    issuance at April 24, 2009.

Stock Repurchase Program

— Since the inception

    $28.06 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $2,927,376.
    As of April 24, 2009, our Board of Directors had authorized
    the repurchase of up to $4,023,639 of common stock under the
    various stock repurchase programs, and $1,096,262 remains
    available under these authorizations. The stock repurchase
    program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

During fiscal 2009, we repurchased 16,960 shares of our
    common stock at an aggregate cost of $399,981, or a weighted
    average price of $23.58 per share. During fiscal 2008, we
    repurchased 32,772 shares of our common stock at an
    aggregate cost of $903,704, or a weighted average price of
    $27.58 per share. The repurchases were recorded as treasury

    Other Assets within the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets. The valuation allowance decreased by $528 in fiscal 2009
    primarily due to a change in the blended state tax rates.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As discussed in Note 2, effective April 28, 2007, we
    adopted FIN No. 48,

“Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109,”

, which clarifies the
    accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
    enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income
    Taxes”

. This interpretation prescribes a recognition
    threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
    recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
    to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides
    guidance on derecognition of tax benefits, classification on the
    balance sheet, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure, and transition.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Out of the entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits at
    April 24, 2009, $93,136 , if recognized, would affect our
    provision for income taxes.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. During
    the fiscal years ended 2005 through 2009, we recognized total
    accrued interest and penalties of approximately $170 and have
    included this accrual in our liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits.

We are subject to taxation in the United States, various states,
    and several foreign jurisdictions.

The tax years that remain subject to examination for our major
    tax jurisdictions are shown below:

In addition, we are effectively subject to federal tax
    examination adjustments for tax years ended on or after fiscal
    year 2000, in that we have net operating loss carryforwards from
    these years that could be subject to adjustment, if and when
    utilized.

We are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the
    United States for the fiscal years 2003 and 2004 and in several
    foreign tax jurisdictions. The rights to some of our
    intellectual property (“IP”) are owned by certain of
    our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made between foreign
    and U.S. tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this IP
    in a qualified cost sharing arrangement. Recently, several other
    U.S. companies have had their foreign IP arrangements
    challenged as part of IRS examinations, which have resulted in
    material proposed assessments

and/or

pending litigation. During fiscal 2009, we received Notices of
    Proposed Adjustments from the IRS in connection with the tax
    audit of our fiscal year 2003 and 2004 tax returns. We recently
    filed a protest with the IRS in response to



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Notices of Proposed Adjustment. The Notices of Proposed
    Adjustment focus primarily on issues of the timing and the
    amount of income recognized and deductions taken during the
    audit years and on the level of cost allocations made to foreign
    operations during the audit years. At this time we cannot make a
    determination as to the amount our unrecognized tax benefits
    will be reduced as a result of the audit. We do not expect
    resolution of our IRS audit or other audits within significant
    foreign or state jurisdictions over the next 12 months.

As mentioned above, the rights to some of our IP are owned by
    certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made
    between foreign and U.S. tax jurisdictions relating to the
    use of this IP and a qualified cost sharing arrangement.
    Effective September 27, 2007, the IRS’s Large and
    Mid-Sized Business Division (“LMSB”) released a
    Coordinated Issues Paper (“CIP”) with respect to
    qualified cost sharing arrangements (“CSAs”).
    Specifically, this CIP provides guidance to IRS personnel
    concerning methods that may be applied to evaluate the
    arm’s length charge (buy-in payment) for internally
    developed (pre-existing) as well as acquisition-related
    intangible property that is made available to a qualified CSA.
    On March 20, 2008, the IRS’s LMSB also released a CIP
    with respect to the cost sharing of stock based compensation.
    Specifically, this CIP provides guidance to IRS personnel
    concerning stock based compensation related to a CSA by
    providing that the parties to a CSA will share all costs related
    to intangible development of the covered intangibles, including
    but not limited to, salaries, bonuses, and other payroll costs
    and benefits. Taxpayers should include all forms of compensation
    in the cost pool, including those costs related to stock-based
    compensation.

Additionally, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
    Circuit on May 27, 2009 held in Xilinx Inc. v.
    Commissioner that stock-based compensation must be included in
    the research and development cost base of companies that have
    entered into a cost sharing arrangement and must, therefore, be
    allocated among the participants based on anticipated benefits.
    The Court’s reversal of the prior U.S. Tax Court
    decision will change our estimate of tax benefits that were
    required to be recognized in connection with our adoption of
    FIN 48 at the beginning of fiscal year 2008. We are
    currently evaluating the impact of the Xilinx case on our
    provision for income taxes for the first quarter of fiscal 2010
    but expect any final adjustment will be limited to a reduction
    of our unrecognized tax attributes.

Pursuant to the requirements of Footnote 82 of
    SFAS No. 123R, we do not include unrealized stock
    option attributes as components of our gross deferred tax assets
    and corresponding valuation allowance disclosures. Footnote 82
    is applied on a prospective basis. The tax effected amounts of
    gross unrealized net operating loss and business tax credit
    carryforwards, and their corresponding valuation allowance
    excluded under Footnote 82 for the years ended April 24,
    2009 and April 25, 2008 are $278,890 and $245,130,
    respectively, which will result in additional paid in capital if
    and when realized as a reduction in taxes otherwise paid.

As of our fiscal years ended April 24, 2009 and
    April 25, 2008, the amount of accumulated unremitted
    earnings from our foreign subsidiaries under APB No. 23 is
    approximately $873,100 and $677,200, respectively.

During fiscal 2006, our Netherlands subsidiary received a
    favorable tax ruling from the Netherlands tax authorities
    effective May 1, 2005. This ruling replaced a previous
    Netherlands tax ruling that was scheduled to expire on
    December 31, 2005. This ruling results in both a lower
    level of earnings subject to tax in the Netherlands and an
    extension of the expiration date to April 30, 2010.

Network Appliance Systems India Pvt. Ltd. received a tax holiday
    from the Indian tax authorities attributed to its call center
    and research and development activities effective June 6,
    2003. These activities qualify under the Software Technology
    Park of India (“STPI”) incentive for the development
    and manufacture of computer software and information technology
    enabled services. Under this tax holiday, net income derived
    from call center and research and development activities is
    exempt from Indian taxation. This tax holiday is set to expire
    on March 31, 2010. Notwithstanding qualification for this
    tax holiday, new general minimum tax rules in India effective
    for us as of fiscal 2009 override the full tax exemption. For
    fiscal 2009, we were subject to a minimum tax on this income in
    India at a rate of 11.33%.

As of April 24, 2009, our Netherlands subsidiary had a
    conditional royalty expense carryforward of $62,624 that may
    become available for offset against future Netherlands income.
    The carryforward may not, however, be used to offset income
    under the new Netherlands tax ruling expiring April 30,
    2010. The carryforward does not have an expiration date. We have
    established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset
    for the carryforward based upon our belief that we will not be
    able to utilize this attribute. In the event we are able to
    utilize this attribute, the tax benefit of the carryforward will
    be accounted for as a credit to stockholders’ equity of
    $9,219 and as a reduction to the income tax provision of $6,750.

As of April 24, 2009, the federal and state net operating
    loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately
    $538,372 and $142,414, respectively. The federal net operating
    loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2020. State
    net operating losses of $6,074 will expire in fiscal years 2010
    through 2012; $10,640 will expire in fiscal year 2013 while the
    remaining $125,700 will expire in fiscal years 2014 through 2029.

As of April 24, 2009, we had federal and state tax credit
    carryforwards of approximately $81,635 and $81,220,
    respectively, available to offset future income tax liabilities.
    Federal tax credit carryforwards of $40,077 will begin to expire
    in fiscal years 2010 through 2021, while the remaining $41,558
    will expire in fiscal years beginning 2022. State tax credits of
    $41 will expire in fiscal years 2010 through 2013, while the
    remaining $81,179 is available indefinitely to reduce cash taxes
    otherwise payable. As discussed above, most of the net operating
    loss and tax credit carryovers, if realized, will be recognized
    as additional paid in capital in that they are employee stock
    option tax attributes.

During fiscal 2004, as part of our acquisition of Spinnaker, we
    acquired approximately $52,000 and $12,000 of federal and state
    net operating losses, respectively, and $2,700 of federal tax
    credits that were realized as deferred tax assets upon
    acquisition. We also established a valuation allowance of $2,400
    against a portion of the state net operating loss carryforwards
    of Spinnaker, which if utilized, will be treated as a reduction
    of income tax expense.

During fiscal 2006, as part of our acquisition of Decru, we
    acquired approximately $32,100 of federal net operating losses
    and $1,100 of federal tax credits that were realized as deferred
    tax assets upon acquisition. We also established valuation
    reserves of $1,200 and $1,200 against all of Decru’s state
    net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credit
    carryforwards, respectively, that existed as of the acquisition
    date. If utilized, these attributes will be treated as a
    reduction of income tax expense.

we
    operate in one reportable industry segment: the design,
    manufacturing, marketing, and technical support of
    high-performance networked storage solutions. We market our

    by SFAS No. 131. The CODMs evaluates resource
    allocation decisions and operational performance based upon
    revenue by geographic regions. Under SFAS No. 131, we
    have one reportable segment, as our three geographic operating
    segments can be aggregated into one reportable segment as they
    have similar operating characteristics. For fiscal years 2009,

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

Effective April 26, 2008, we adopted
    SFAS No. 157,

“Fair Value Measurements”
    (

SFAS No. 157

)

, except as it applies to the
    non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities subject to
    Financial Staff Position

SFAS No. 157-2.

SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that
    would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
    at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based
    measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that
    market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities.
    When determining the fair value measurements for assets and
    liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value,
    we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which
    these assets and liabilities would be transacted.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

No. 157-3

“Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When
    the Market for That Asset Is Not Active”

(“FSP

No. 157-3”).

FSP

No. 157-3

clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157, which we
    adopted as of July 26, 2008, in situations where the market
    is not active. The adoption of FSP

No. 157-3

did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    position or results of operations.

In January 2009, the FASB issued FSP Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”)

No. 99-20-1,

“Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue

99-20.”

FSP EITF

No. 99-20-1

requires us to recognize other-than temporary impairments as a
    realized loss through earnings when it is probable that there
    has been an adverse change in estimated cash flows from the cash
    flows previously projected. We adopted FSP

No. EITF 99-20-1

as of January 24, 2009. Adoption did not have a material
    impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash
    flows.

Fair
    Value Hierarchy:

SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
    requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and
    minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
    value. The hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to
    measure fair value from market based assumptions to entity
    specific assumptions is as follows:

Level 1:

observable inputs such as quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities,
    and readily accessible by us at the reporting date;

Level 2:

inputs other than the quoted
    prices in active markets that are observable either directly or
    indirectly in active markets; and

Level 3:

unobservable inputs in which
    there is little or no market data, which require us to develop
    our own assumptions.

We consider an active market to be one in which transactions for
    the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and
    volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, and
    view an inactive market as one in which there are few
    transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not
    current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time
    or among market makers. Where appropriate our own or the
    counterparty’s non-performance risk is considered in
    determining the fair values of liabilities and assets,
    respectively.

The following table summarizes our financial assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in
    accordance with SFAS No. 157 as of April 24, 2009:

Our marketable securities include U.S. Treasury securities,
    U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, corporate
    securities, auction rate securities, and money market funds,
    including the Primary Fund and certificates of deposit. Cash
    equivalents consist of instruments with remaining maturities of
    three months or less at the date of purchase. The remaining
    balance of cash equivalents consists primarily of certain money
    market funds, for which the carrying amounts is a reasonable
    estimate of fair value.

We classify investments within Level 1 if quoted prices are
    available in active markets. Level 1 investments generally
    include U.S. Treasury notes, trading securities with quoted
    prices on active markets, and money market funds, with the
    exception of the Primary Fund, which is classified in
    Level 3.

We classify items in Level 2 if the investments are valued
    using observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark
    yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative
    pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
    These investments include: corporate bonds, corporate
    securities, U.S. government agency bonds, certificates of
    deposit, and foreign currency contracts. Investments are held by
    a custodian who obtains investment prices from a third party
    pricing provider that uses standard inputs to models which vary
    by asset class. We corroborate the prices obtained from the
    pricing service against other independent sources and, as of
    April 24, 2009, have not found it necessary to make any
    adjustments to the prices obtained. Included in Level 2 are
    corporate bonds issued by Lehman Brothers.

Our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are also
    classified within Level 2. We determine the fair value of
    these instruments by considering the estimated amount we would
    pay or receive to terminate these agreements at the reporting
    date. We use observable inputs, including quoted prices in
    active markets for similar assets or liabilities. Foreign
    currency contracts consist of forward foreign exchange contracts
    for primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and
    Australian dollar. Our foreign currency derivative contracts are
    classified within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based
    on quoted market prices of similar instruments in active
    markets. In fiscal 2009, net losses generated by hedged assets
    and liabilities totaled $25,905, which were offset by gains on
    the related derivative instruments of $20,872. In fiscal 2008,
    net gains generated by hedged assets and liabilities totaled
    $12,752, which were offset by losses on the related derivative
    instruments of $13,487. In fiscal 2007, net gains generated by
    hedged assets and liabilities totaled $5,180, which were offset
    by losses on the related derivative instruments of $2,829.

We classify items in Level 3 if the investments are valued
    using a pricing model or based on unobservable inputs in the
    market. These investments include auction rate securities, the
    Primary Fund and cost method investments.

The table below provides a reconciliation of our Level 3

As of April 24, 2009, we have an investment in the Primary
    Fund, an AAA-rated money market fund at the time of purchase,
    with a par value of $60,928 and an estimated fair value of
    $51,630, which suspended redemptions in September 2008 and is in
    the process of liquidating its portfolio of investments. During
    fiscal 2009, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment
    charge of $9,298, which was our pro rata share of the Primary
    Fund’s overall investment in Lehman Brothers’
    securities. All amounts invested in the Primary Fund are
    included in long-term investments given the lack of liquidity of
    the fund and the uncertainty as to the timing and the amount of
    the final distributions of the fund.

The Primary Fund investments were classified as Level 3 due
    to lack of market data to determine fair value. We received
    total distributions of $546,344 in fiscal 2009 from the Primary
    Fund. Those proceeds have been invested in unrelated money
    market funds. Our remaining investment in the Primary Fund as of
    April 24, 2009 is $51,630.

As of April 24, 2009, we had auction rate securities with a
    par value of $75,400 and an estimated fair value of $66,537.
    Substantially all of our ARS are backed by pools of student
    loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education.
    During fiscal 2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary
    impairment loss of $2,122, due to a decline in the estimated
    fair values of certain of our ARS related to credit quality risk
    and rating downgrades. Based on an analysis of the fair value
    and marketability of these investments, we recorded temporary
    impairment charges of approximately $7,037 as of April 24,
    2009, partially offset by unrealized gains of $296, within other
    comprehensive income (loss). We estimated the fair value for
    each individual ARS using an income (discounted cash flow)
    approach which incorporates both observable and unobservable
    inputs to discount the expected future cash flows.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Based on our ability to access our cash and other short-term
    investments, our expected operating cash flows, and our other
    sources of cash, we have the intent and ability to hold these
    investments until recovery of par value. We will continue to
    monitor our ARS investments in light of the current debt market
    environment and evaluate our accounting for these investments
    quarterly.

At April 24, 2009, we held $3,969 of other investments
    consisting of a private equity fund and direct investments in
    technology companies. These investments are accounted for using
    the cost method under Accounting Principles Board
    (“APB”) Opinion No. 18, “

The Equity
    Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.

”
    During fiscal 2009, we recorded $6,320 of impairment charges on
    certain of these investments and adjusted their carrying amount
    to fair value, as we deemed the decline in the value of those
    assets to be other-than-temporary. These cost method investments
    fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, due to the
    use of significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value,
    as the investments are in privately held technology entities
    without quoted market prices.

Other
    Fair Value Disclosures

In accordance with SFAS No. 107, “

Disclosures
    about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

,” we are
    required to disclose the fair value of our long-term debt at
    least annually or more frequently if the fair value has changed
    significantly. Our convertible notes and debt are carried at
    cost. The fair value of our debt also approximates its carrying
    value as of April 25, 2008 based upon inputs that are
    observable directly in active markets (Level 2). The
    estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $1,143,244
    at April 24, 2009, based upon quoted market information
    (Level 2).

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Financial Liabilities”

(SFAS No. 159).
    SFAS No. 159 provides companies the option (the
    “Fair Value Option”) to measure certain financial
    instruments and other items at fair value. Unrealized gains and
    losses on items for which the Fair Value Option has been elected
    are reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007,
    although earlier adoption is permitted. Currently, we have
    elected not to adopt the Fair Value Option under this
    pronouncement.

Derivatives
    and Hedging Activities

We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign
    currency risk. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is
    to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated
    with changes in foreign currency. The program is not designated
    for trading or speculative purposes. Our derivatives expose us
    to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be
    unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We seek to mitigate
    such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial
    institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any
    one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is
    monitored on an ongoing basis. We also have in place a master
    netting arrangement to mitigate the credit risk of our
    counterparty and potentially to reduce our losses due to
    counterparty nonperformance. All contracts have a maturity of
    less than six months.

In accordance with SFAS No. 133
    (“SFAS No. 133”), “

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

”, we
    recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities
    on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in fair value (i.e.
    gains or losses) of the derivatives are recorded as revenues or
    other income (expense), or as accumulated other comprehensive
    income (“OCI”). If the derivative is designated as a
    hedge, depending on the nature of the exposure being hedged,
    changes in fair value will either be offset against the change
    in fair value of the hedged items through earnings or recognized
    in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is
    recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedge is
    recognized in earnings immediately.

Currently, we do not enter into any foreign exchange forward
    contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments or
    nonmarketable investments. Our major foreign currency exchange
    exposures and related hedging programs are described below:

Balance Sheet.

We utilize monthly foreign
    currency forward and options contracts to hedge exchange rate
    fluctuations related to certain foreign monetary assets and
    liabilities. These derivative instruments do not subject us to
    material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements
    because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to
    offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being
    hedged and the net amount is included in earnings. In fiscal
    2009, net loss generated by hedged assets and liabilities
    totaled $25,905, which were offset by gains on the related
    derivative instruments of $20,872, which includes time value
    expense of $719 on cash flow revenue hedge contracts.

Forecasted Transactions.

We use currency
    forward contracts to hedge exposures related to forecasted sales
    denominated in certain foreign currencies. These contracts are
    designated as cash flow hedges and in general closely match the
    underlying forecasted transactions in duration. The contracts
    are carried on the balance sheet at fair value, and the
    effective portion of the contracts’ gains and losses is
    recorded as other comprehensive income (loss) until the
    forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction
    occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow
    hedge to revenue. If the underlying forecasted transactions do
    not occur, or it becomes probable that they will not occur, the
    gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge is recognized
    immediately in



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

earnings. We measure the effectiveness of hedges of forecasted
    transactions on a monthly basis by comparing the fair values of
    the designated currency forward contracts with the fair values
    of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion of the
    derivative hedging gain or loss as well as changes in the fair
    value of the derivative’s time value (which are excluded
    from the assessment of hedge effectiveness) is recognized in
    current period earnings. During fiscal 2009, no ineffectiveness
    was recognized in earnings and the time value component in our
    cash flow hedges of $719 was recognized as a reduction to other
    income, (expenses), net.

Over the next twelve months, it is expected that $524 of
    derivative net losses recorded in other comprehensive income
    (“OCI”) as of April 24, 2009 will be reclassified
    into earnings as an adjustment to sales revenue. The maximum
    length of time over which forecasted foreign denominated sales
    revenues are hedged is six months.

As of April 24, 2009, we had the following outstanding
    currency forward contracts that were entered into to hedge
    forecasted foreign denominated sales and our balance sheet
    monetary asset and liability exposures:

Employee
    Benefit, Incentive Compensation Plans and Deferred

We have established a 401(k) tax-deferred savings plan
    (“Savings Plan”). Employees meeting the eligibility
    requirements, as defined, may contribute specified percentages
    of their salaries. We contributed $13,568, $12,241, and $10,920
    for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively to the Savings Plan.

All employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the
    Incentive Compensation Plan (“Incentive Plan”)
    provided that they meet certain requirements pursuant to the
    Incentive Plan. Incentive Plan contributions totaled $66,178,
    $56,632, and $56,722 in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007.

At April 24, 2009, we have marketable securities of $7,934
    related to investments in debt and equity securities that are
    held in a rabbi trust under non-qualified deferred compensation
    plans. The total related deferred compensation liability was
    $7,934 at April 24, 2009, of which $953 was classified as

Acquisition
    of Onaro

On January 28, 2008, we acquired Onaro, Inc.
    (“Onaro”), a privately-held company based in Boston,
    Massachusetts, that provided software solutions for enterprises
    to increase service quality, return on storage, and compliance
    by managing storage as a service. Goodwill of $79,211 was
    recorded in connection with our acquisition of Onaro. The
    acquisition gave our customers access to new storage service
    management and change management capabilities. It allowed us to
    help enterprise organizations increase data center and storage
    network efficiencies by proactively managing and optimizing
    storage service levels for availability and performance in
    dynamic data center environments, using our cost-effective and
    highly scalable modular storage systems.

We plan to further develop and extend Onaro’s service
    management software technologies and build upon the foundation
    that the Onaro’s software provides. In addition, Onaro has
    an experienced and knowledgeable workforce and an existing
    infrastructure. These opportunities, along with the ability to
    leverage the Onaro workforce, were primary contributing factors
    to the establishment of the purchase price, resulting in the
    recognition of a significant amount of goodwill. The fair values
    assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed were based on management estimates and
    assumptions, and other information compiled by management that
    utilized established valuation techniques appropriate for the
    high-technology industry. Goodwill recorded as a result of this
    acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

The net deferred income tax liability of $11,709 recorded in
    connection with this acquisition is comprised of deferred tax
    assets of $2,893, primarily related to net operating losses
    incurred from inception through the acquisition date and a
    deferred tax liability of $14,602 related to acquired intangible
    assets.

As of the acquisition date, no amounts were allocated to
    in-process research and development. In-process research and
    development is dependent on the status of new projects on the
    date the acquisition is consummated. Prior to the acquisition
    date, Onaro had released new versions of its software products.
    Accordingly, there were no substantive research and development
    projects in process on the date the acquisition was consummated.

Acquisition
    of Topio

On December 7, 2006, we acquired Topio, Inc.
    (“Topio”), a privately-held company based in
    Santa Clara, California that developed and sold
    enterprise-class software for data replication and rapid
    recovery across the spectrum of locations, platforms and storage
    that support an enterprise. The acquisition will continue to
    expand our data protection portfolio and simplify the
    replication of data from other storage arrays to our storage
    systems.

Goodwill of $114,700 was recorded in connection with our
    acquisition of Topio. The current and future potential of the
    Topio technology will enable us to expand our data protection
    portfolio and simplify the replication of data from other
    storage arrays to our storage systems. In addition, Topio has an
    experienced and knowledgeable workforce and an existing
    infrastructure. These opportunities, along with the ability to
    leverage the Topio workforce, were significant contributing
    factors to the establishment of the purchase price, resulting in
    the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill. The fair
    values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed are based on management estimates and
    assumptions, and other information compiled by management that
    utilized established valuation techniques appropriate for the
    high-technology industry. Goodwill recorded as a result of this
    acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

The net deferred income tax liability of $5,150 recorded in
    connection with this acquisition is comprised of deferred tax
    assets of $7,644 primarily related to net operating losses
    incurred from inception through the acquisition date and a
    deferred tax liability of $12,794 related to acquired intangible
    assets.

Because Topio had recently introduced its products as of the
    date of acquisition, no amount was allocated to in-process
    research and development.

Divestiture
    of NetCache

On September 11, 2006, we completed the sale of certain
    assets of our NetCache product line to Blue Coat and agreed not
    to compete in the market served by NetCache for a period of no
    less than three years from and after September 11, 2006. We
    received $23,914 in cash and 360 shares of Blue Coat’s
    common stock with a fair value of $4,637 as of
    September 11, 2006. In addition, we accrued $2,032 for
    costs expected to be incurred to fulfill our engineering and
    service contractual obligations. Because of these continuing
    obligations, the NetCache sale did not qualify for presentation
    as a discontinued operation. As a result of this divestiture, we
    recorded a pre-tax gain of $25,339 in our income from operations
    and a reduction of goodwill of $1,179. We recorded revenues of
    $57,421 from NetCache products for fiscal 2007. The contribution
    to operating income from these products was not significant.

Goodwill
    and Purchased Intangible Assets

Under SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,”

goodwill attributable to each of
    our reporting units is required to be tested for impairment by
    comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its
    carrying value. Our reporting units are the same as our
    operating segments, as defined by SFAS No. 131,
    “

Segment Reporting

.”

We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually, or more
    frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that
    the recorded goodwill may be impaired. During fiscal 2009, we
    experienced a decline in our stock price, resulting in a loss of
    market capitalization. However, we determined that no events or
    circumstances had occurred to indicate that an assessment was
    necessary, other than our required annual assessment. As of
    April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, there was no
    impairment of goodwill. We will continue to monitor conditions
    and changes in the global economy that could impact future
    operating results of our reporting units. If the businesses
    acquired fail to meet our expectations as set out at the time of
    acquisition or if the market capitalization of our stock trades

Our acquired patents are intended to enhance our technology base
    to build next-generation network-attached storage, storage area
    network, and fabric-attached storage systems for the benefit of
    our enterprise customers. The costs of such patents for use in
    research and development activities that have alternative future
    uses have been capitalized and amortized over an estimated
    useful life of five years as research and development expenses.

Existing technology is amortized as cost of product revenue.
    Trademarks, tradenames, customer contracts and relationships are
    amortized as sales and marketing expenses. Covenants not to
    compete are amortized as general and administrative expenses.

In December 2008, we decided to cease development and
    availability of our SnapMirror for Open Systems product. In
    connection with this decision, we recorded charges of $14,917
    attributable to the impairment of existing technology and

Restructuring
    and Other Charges

Fiscal
    2009 Restructuring Plans

In February 2009, we announced our decision to execute a
    worldwide restructuring program, which included a reduction in
    workforce, the closing or downsizing of certain facilities, and
    the establishment of a plan to outsource certain internal
    activities. In December 2008, we announced our decision to cease
    the development and availability of our
    SnapMirror

®

for Open Systems (“SMOS”) product, which was
    originally acquired through our acquisition of Topio in fiscal
    2007. As part of this decision, we also announced the closure of
    our engineering facility in Haifa, Israel.

These restructuring activities resulted in restructuring charges
    totaling $51,447 related to severance-related amounts and other
    charges attributable to the termination of approximately 450
    regular positions, abandoned excess facilities charges relating
    to non-cancelable lease costs, which are net of expected
    sublease income; contract cancellation charges; and outplacement
    expenses, to support restructuring and fixed assets intangibles
    write-offs; as well as $2,959 of other charges to support our
    restructuring initiatives. In recording the facility lease
    restructuring reserve, we made certain estimates and assumptions
    related to the (i) time period over which the relevant
    buildings would remain vacant, (ii) sublease terms, and
    (iii) sublease rates.

As of April 24, 2009, approximately $15,896 of the costs
    associated with these activities were unpaid. We expect that
    severance-related charges and other costs will be substantially
    paid by the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and the
    facilities-related lease payments to be substantially paid by
    the third quarter of fiscal 2013.

Fiscal
    2002 Restructuring Plan

As of April 24, 2009, we also have $1,265 remaining in
    facility restructuring reserves established as part of a
    restructuring in fiscal 2002 related to future lease commitments
    on exited facilities, net of expected sublease

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

income. We reevaluate our estimates and assumptions periodically
    and make adjustments as necessary based on the time period over
    which the facilities will be vacant, expected sublease terms,
    and expected sublease rates. During fiscal 2009, we recorded
    restructuring recoveries of $61 resulting from a change in the
    estimated operating expenses relating to this facility
    restructuring reserve. We expect to substantially fulfill the
    remaining contractual obligations related to this facility
    restructuring reserve by fiscal 2011.

The following table summarizes the provisions, respective
    payments, and remaining accrued balance as of April 24,

Real
    Estate Leases

We have commitments related to four lease arrangements with
    BNPPLC for approximately 564,274 square feet of office
    space for our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. As of
    April 24, 2009, we have a leasing arrangement
    (“Leasing Arrangements 1”) which requires us to lease
    land in Sunnyvale to BNPPLC for a period of 99 years and to
    lease approximately 190,000 square feet of space costing up
    to $48,500. As of April 24, 2009, we also have commitments
    relating to financing and operating leasing arrangements with
    BNPPLC (“Leasing Arrangements 2, 3, 4”) for land and
    approximately 374,274 square feet of buildings located in
    Sunnyvale, California, costing up to $101,050. Under these
    leasing arrangements, we began paying BNPPLC minimum lease
    payments, which vary based on LIBOR plus a spread or a fixed
    rate on the costs of the facilities on the respective lease
    commencement dates. We will make payments for each of the leases
    for a term of five years. We have the option to renew each of
    the leases for two consecutive five-year periods upon approval
    by BNPPLC. Upon expiration (or upon any earlier termination) of
    the lease terms, we must elect one of the following options:
    (i) purchase the buildings from BNPPLC at cost;
    (ii) if certain conditions are met, arrange for the sale of
    the buildings by BNPPLC to a third party for an amount equal to
    at least 85% of the costs (residual guarantee), and be liable
    for any deficiency between the net proceeds received from the
    third party and such amounts; or (iii) pay BNPPLC
    supplemental payments for an amount equal to at least 85% of the
    costs (residual guarantee), in which event we may recoup some or
    all of such payments by arranging for a sale of each or all
    buildings by BNPPLC during the ensuing two-year period. The
    following table summarizes the costs, the residual guarantee,
    the applicable LIBOR plus spread or fixed rate at April 24,

All leases require us to maintain specified financial covenants
    with which we were in compliance as of April 24, 2009. Such
    specified financial covenants include a maximum ratio of Total
    Debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and
    Amortization (“EBITDA”) and a minimum amount of
    Unencumbered Cash and Short-Term Investments.

On April 1, 2009, we terminated two leasing arrangement in
    connection with two buildings located in Sunnyvale, California
    and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, and repaid $119,297
    of the outstanding balance under the leasing arrangements, a
    portion of which is included in construction-in-progress at
    April 24, 2009.

On December 1, 2008, we terminated a leasing arrangement in
    connection with a separate building located in Sunnyvale,
    California and repaid $8,080 of the outstanding balance drawn
    under the construction allowance. As a

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

result of these terminations, we are no longer contractually
    obligated to pay lease payments for the lease periods and the
    residual guarantees.

Guarantees

As of April 24, 2009, our financial guarantees consisted of
    standby letters of credit outstanding, bank guarantees, foreign
    rent guarantees, service performance guarantees, customs and
    duties guarantees, VAT requirements, workers’ compensation
    plans and surety bonds, which were primarily related to self
    insurance. The maximum amount of potential future payments under
    these arrangements was $12,104 as of April 24, 2009, of
    which $1,001 and $5,182 were collateralized as short-term and
    long-term restricted cash and investments, respectively, on our
    balance sheet. The maximum amount of potential future payments
    under these arrangements was $253,350 as of April 25, 2008, of
    which $2,953 and $247,234 were collateralized by short-term and
    long-term restricted cash, respectively, on our consolidated
    balance sheets.

Warranty
    Reserve

We provide customers a warranty on software of ninety days and a
    warranty on hardware with terms ranging from one to three years.
    Estimated future warranty costs are expensed as a cost of
    product revenues when revenue is recognized, based on estimates
    of the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations
    including material, distribution and labor costs. Our accrued
    liability for estimated future warranty costs is included in
    other accrued liabilities and other long-term obligations on the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Factors that affect
    our warranty liability include the number of installed units,
    estimated material costs, estimated distribution costs and
    estimated labor costs. We periodically assess the adequacy of
    our warranty accrual and adjust the amount as considered
    necessary. During fiscal year 2009, 2008, and 2007, we accrued
    warranty charges of $25,909, $26,997 and $22,082, respectively.
    As of April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, our warranty
    reserve accrual balances were $42, 325 and $42,815, respectively.

Recourse
    and Nonrecourse Leases

We have both recourse and nonrecourse lease financing
    arrangements with third-party leasing companies through
    preexisting relationships with customers. Under the terms of
    recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we
    remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments
    to the third-party leasing company in the event that any
    customers default. These arrangements are generally
    collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets.
    For these recourse arrangements, revenues on the sale of our
    product to the leasing company are deferred and recognized into
    income as payments to the leasing company are received. As of
    April 24, 2009, and April 25, 2008, the maximum
    recourse exposure under such leases totaled approximately
    $25,682 and $24,842, respectively. Under the terms of the
    nonrecourse leases, we do not have any continuing obligations or
    liabilities. To date, we have not experienced material losses
    under our lease financing programs.

Purchase
    Commitments

In the normal course of business we make commitments to our
    third party contract manufacturers, to manage manufacturer lead
    times and meet product forecasts, and to other parties, to
    purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our
    products. We establish accruals for estimated losses on
    purchased components for which we believe it is probable that
    they will not be utilized in future operations. To the extent
    that such forecasts are not achieved, our commitments and
    associated accruals may change.

Indemnification
    agreements

We enter into standard indemnification agreements in the
    ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, we
    agree to defend and indemnify the other party —
    primarily our customers or business partners or subcontractors
    — for damages and reasonable costs incurred in any
    suit or claim brought against them alleging that



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

our products sold to them infringe any U.S. patent,
    copyright, trade secret, or similar right. If a product becomes
    the subject of an infringement claim, we may, at our option:
    (i) replace the product with another noninfringing product
    that provides substantially similar performance;
    (ii) modify the infringing product so that it no longer
    infringes but remains functionally equivalent; (iii) obtain
    the right for the customer to continue using the product at our
    expense and for the reseller to continue selling the product;
    (iv) take back the infringing product and refund to
    customer the purchase price paid less depreciation amortized on
    a straight-line basis. We have not been required to make
    material payments pursuant to these provisions historically. We
    have not recorded any liability at April 24, 2009, and
    April 25, 2008, respectively, related to these guarantees
    since the maximum amount of potential future payments under such
    guarantees, indemnities and warranties is not determinable,
    other than as described above.

Legal
    Contingencies

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which may
    arise in the normal course of business. While the outcome of
    these legal matters is currently not determinable, we do not
    believe that any current litigation or claims will have a
    material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, operating
    results, or financial condition.

In April 2009, we entered into a settlement agreement with the
    United States of America, acting through the United States
    Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and on behalf of the
    General Services Administration (the “GSA”), under
    which we agreed to pay the United States $128,000, plus interest
    of $715, related to a dispute regarding our discount practices
    and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of GSA
    contracts between August 1997 and February 2005.

On September 5, 2007, we filed a patent infringement
    lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory
    damages and a permanent injunction against Sun Microsystems. On
    October 25, 2007, Sun Microsystems filed a counter claim
    against us in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory
    damages and a permanent injunction. On October 29, 2007,
    Sun filed a second lawsuit against us in the Northern District
    of California asserting additional patents against us. The Texas
    court granted a joint motion to transfer the Texas lawsuit to
    the Northern District of California on November 26, 2007.
    On March 26, 2008, Sun filed a third lawsuit in federal
    court that extends the patent infringement charges to storage
    management technology we acquired in January 2008. The three
    lawsuits are currently in the discovery phase and no trial date
    has been set, so we are unable at this time to determine the
    likely outcome of these various patent litigations. Since we are
    unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any
    potential settlement, no accrual has been recorded as of
    April 24, 2009.

15.

Subsequent
    Event

On May 20, 2009, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of
    Merger (the merger agreement) by and among us, Kentucky Merger
    Sub One Corporation, our wholly owned subsidiary, referred to as
    Merger Sub One, Derby Merger Sub Two LLC, our wholly owned
    subsidiary, referred to as Merger Sub Two, and Data Domain. The
    merger agreement was subsequently amended on June 3, 2009
    to reflect the terms described below. The merger agreement
    provides for the acquisition of Data Domain by NetApp by means
    of a merger of Merger Sub One with and into Data Domain,
    referred to as the first-step merger, with Data Domain as the
    interim surviving entity, immediately followed by a merger of
    Data Domain, as the interim surviving entity, with and into
    Merger Sub Two, referred to as the second-step merger, with
    Merger Sub Two as the final surviving entity.

Upon the completion of the first-step merger, Data Domain will
    become our wholly owned subsidiary, and each share of Data
    Domain common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
    the completion of the first-step merger, will be cancelled and
    converted into the right to receive, subject to adjustment as
    described below, a combination of $16.45 in cash, or the cash
    consideration, without interest and less any required
    withholding, and a certain number of shares of our common stock,
    or the stock consideration, and together with the cash
    consideration, the merger consideration. The number of shares of
    our common stock issuable in exchange for Data Domain common
    stock will be determined by dividing $13.55 by the closing
    average, defined as the average closing price of our common
    stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the 10 consecutive
    trading days ending on the third



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

trading day immediately prior to the closing date of the
    first-step merger; provided, that if the closing average is less
    than $17.41, each share of Data Domain common stock will be
    exchangeable for 0.7783 shares of our common stock and if
    the closing average is greater than $21.27, each share of Data
    Domain common stock will be exchangeable for 0.637 shares
    of our common stock. In the event that the exchange ratio is
    greater than or equal to 0.7006 and less than 0.7783, we may
    (a) reduce the stock consideration by such amount as we may
    determine and (b) increase the cash consideration by an
    amount equal to the product of (i) the amount of such
    reduction in the stock consideration multiplied by (ii) the
    closing average. However, we may not reduce the amount of the
    stock consideration and increase the cash consideration as
    described in the immediately preceding sentence to the extent
    that it would reasonably be expected to cause the merger to fail
    to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal
    Revenue Code. In addition, if the aggregate amount of the stock
    consideration issuable in the merger (including the stock
    consideration issuable to holders of Data Domain options and
    restricted stock units) would exceed 19.5% of the outstanding
    shares of our common stock immediately prior to the effective
    time of the first-step merger, the stock consideration will be
    decreased to the minimum extent necessary so that no more than
    19.5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock will be
    issued in the merger (with such percentage measured immediately
    prior to the effective time of the first-step merger). In such
    event, the cash consideration will be increased by an amount
    equal to the product of (a) the amount of the reduction in
    the stock consideration multiplied by (b) the closing
    average. In the event that the stock consideration is decreased
    in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, the
    merger may fail to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under
    the Internal Revenue Code.

Upon the completion of the first-step merger, each outstanding
    Data Domain stock option, whether or not then vested and
    exercisable, will be assumed and converted by us. In accordance
    with its terms and the requirements of applicable law, each
    option shall (i) be converted into an option to acquire
    that number of shares of our common stock equal to the product
    obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Data
    Domain common stock subject to such option, by (y) the
    option exchange ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share,
    and (ii) have an exercise price per share equal to the
    quotient obtained by dividing (x) the per share exercise
    price of Data Domain common stock subject to such option, by
    (y) the option exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest
    cent. The option exchange ratio is calculated as the sum of
    (x) the stock consideration to be received pursuant to the
    merger agreement for a share of Data Domain common stock plus
    (y) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the cash
    consideration to be received pursuant to the merger agreement
    for a share of Data Domain common stock, by (2) the average
    closing sales prices of our common stock, rounded to the nearest
    one-hundredth of a cent, for the ten most recent consecutive
    trading days ending on the third trading day immediately prior
    to the effective time of the merger. Each assumed and converted
    option shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and
    conditions (including as to vesting and exercisability) as were
    applicable to the option immediately prior to the completion of
    the first-step merger.

Each of Data Domain’s unvested restricted stock units and
    shares of restricted stock outstanding at the effective time of
    the first-step merger shall be assumed and converted into
    restricted stock units or shares of restricted stock, as
    applicable, representing the right to receive merger
    consideration payable for shares of Data Domain underlying each
    assumed and converted restricted stock unit or restricted share,
    as applicable. Each assumed and converted restricted stock unit
    and share of restricted stock shall otherwise be subject to the
    same terms and conditions, including vesting restrictions, as
    were applicable to such award immediately prior to the
    completion of the first-step merger.



NETAPP,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including
    regulatory approvals. The transaction is valued at approximately
    $2 billion and is expected to be completed in 60 to
    120 days.

Controls
    and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls are procedures designed to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under
    the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure Controls are also
    designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and
    communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the
    end of the period covered by this report (the “Evaluation
    Date”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the

    effective such that the information relating to NetApp,
    including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be
    disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) reports (i) is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
    rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated
    to NetApp’s management, including our principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow
    timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its
    inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
    may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
    any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
    the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
    in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that,
    as of April 24, 2009, our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective based on those criteria.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of April 24, 2009 has been audited by
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is
    included herein.

(c)

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with
    management’s evaluation during our last fiscal quarter that
    have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    effect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

NetApp, Inc.

Sunnyvale, California

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    NetApp, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, the
    “Company”) as of April 24, 2009, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of April 24, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial
    statement schedule as of and for the year ended April 24,
    2009 of the Company and our report dated June 16, 2009
    expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements
    and financial statement schedule.
