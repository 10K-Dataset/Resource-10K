improved data center operations, economical business
continuance, and efficient remote data access. Network
Appliance’s success to date has been in delivering highly
cost-effective network storage solutions that reduce the
complexity associated with conventional storage solutions. Our
products have set the standard for simplicity and ease of
operation, with what we believe to be one of the lowest total
costs of ownership (TCO) and highest returns on investment (ROI)
in the industry. Network Appliance

TM

solutions are
the data management and storage foundation for leading
enterprises, government agencies, and universities worldwide.

Network Appliance was founded in 1992 with the
goal of simplifying data access by creating the world’s
first network storage appliance. The first system was shipped in
1993. Today Network Appliance is a multinational corporation
with over 2,300 employees and an installed base of products in
over 90 countries.

Network Appliance focuses on “simplifying
the complex.” This philosophy drives the entire Company,
from product design and system operation through support
processes. This results in significant customer advantages,
including:

Customer Base

Our diversified customer base spans a number of
large vertical markets. Our storage infrastructure is deployed
in the largest enterprises within each of the vertical markets
on which we have focused our efforts. Examples include:

•

The U.S. federal government is one of
    the largest IT consumers in the world, and Network Appliance
    Federal Systems, Inc., provides solutions for many
    data-intensive activities, including intelligence gathering,
    analysis, and civilian and military operations.

•

Financial services.

New data-processing methodologies,
    shorter time frames for settlement transactions, and new demands
    for better knowledge management are requiring financial services
    firms to improve their data storage infrastructures. Network
    Appliance solutions for enterprise storage enable these
    financial institutions to effectively manage large amounts of
    data in a high-speed distributed infrastructure, enabling
    customers to leverage their existing technology investments and
    derive maximum value from their time-sensitive information.



Customer Challenges

Network Appliance enterprise network storage
solutions directly address the major information technology
challenges that enterprises face — consolidating
rapidly growing quantities of storage, reducing costs associated
with data center operations, ensuring business continuance, and
managing data throughout the globally distributed enterprise.

•

Storage consolidation.

Managing the explosive growth of data
    is one of the greatest challenges enterprises face today.
    Network Appliance gives enterprises the scalable solutions they
    need to consolidate storage from hundreds or thousands of
    servers and manage storage efficiently in a mixed server
    environment.

•

Data center operations.

More than just applications and
    hardware, the data center is the nerve center of an
    organization, controlling the flow of information throughout the
    enterprise. Many of the costs that drive up the total cost of
    information technology (IT) ownership are associated with data
    center operations, and include tasks such as data backup and
    recovery, hardware and software maintenance, performance
    management, and resource allocation. Our simplified appliance
    architecture automates or eliminates many of these
    administrative tasks, and delivers simple, centrally managed,
    and flexible data storage that leverages and increases the
    performance of existing IT infrastructures.

•

Business continuance.

Many enterprises are increasingly
    focused on disaster preparedness and recovery and must avoid
    costly downtime in the event of a major disaster or localized
    disruption. Minutes of downtime are costly, and hours of
    downtime can be catastrophic. Working in tandem with



the existing network infrastructure (both Fibre
    Channel and Ethernet), our storage appliances and data
    management software enable customers to implement disaster
    recovery and data mirroring plans quickly and effectively, while
    minimizing incremental telecommunications and administration
    costs.

•

Distributed enterprise.

As enterprises grow, it becomes
    increasingly difficult to provide timely information to remote
    locations and branch offices, jeopardizing their productivity.
    NetApp products accelerate information access and application
    performance while reducing bandwidth costs, and also reduce the
    cost and complexity associated with managing the data in these
    distributed offices. Our solutions enable enterprises to quickly
    replicate and relay information to and from one or many
    locations, fully protecting data in remote offices and locations.

A Solution-Based Approach

To solve these customer challenges, Network
Appliance offers a growing number of integrated solutions that
address the specific data management hurdles faced by our
enterprise customers. These turnkey solutions, which include
hardware, software, service, and financing components, enable
our customers to simplify their storage management, leverage
their existing infrastructure, and increase their return on
investment. The solutions that have received the greatest level
of interest to date include:

•

File sharing and messaging
    applications are critical to successful enterprise operations.
    Network Appliance offers highly available, scalable, and
    cost-effective storage consolidation solutions that incorporate
    the NetApp unified storage platform and the feature-rich
    functionality of data and resource management software to
    deliver storage with simplified backup and reduced recovery time
    as well as the capability to add storage without downtime. By
    freeing up valuable infrastructure and staff resources, Network
    Appliance storage consolidation solutions improve enterprise
    productivity, performance, and profitability.

•

Data protection:

The
    Network Appliance data protection solution simplifies the
    complex backup and recovery process while accelerating
    time-to-recovery. This is accomplished through reduced
    operational costs, enabling immediate access to information, and
    the elimination of backup windows.

•

Internet access and security:

The Internet access and security
    solution merges proxy caching and storage technologies to
    improve the secure access and management of information to
    eliminate obstacles created by geography, complexity, and
    resource limitations. In accomplishing this NetApp reduces
    costs, increases collaboration, and increases productivity.

No matter the solution, NetApp strives to
simplify whenever possible, utilizing open standards and driving
industry collaboration, partnering with other industry leaders,
and providing world-class global service and support.

•

Simplicity.

The
    NetApp appliance architecture allows enterprises to reduce
    management overhead, decrease deployment times, and eliminate
    downtime typically associated with general-purpose
    architectures. Network Appliance plans to continue to expand on
    the appliance architecture in future product designs and service
    offerings.

•

Open standards and industry collaboration.

Network Appliance participates in and
    leads many industry initiatives and organizations, such as the
    Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA), that have
    defined standards that are widely deployed today. Standards that
    Network Appliance has helped advance include the Network File
    System (NFS) protocol for file access in UNIX® and
    Linux® environments; the Common Internet File System (CIFS)
    protocol for file access in Windows® environments; the
    Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) for simplifying backup
    of networked storage; the Internet Content Adaptation Protocol
    (ICAP) for content adaptation in Web environments; the Direct
    Access File System (DAFS) protocol for high-performance,
    high-throughput access to data; and the Internet Small Computer
    System Interface (iSCSI) protocol for building block-based
    storage area networks using widely deployed Ethernet
    infrastructures. We plan to continue to participate in driving
    emerging standards, including NFS version 4 and 10 Gigabit
    Ethernet.



•

Business application integration and
    partnerships.

Network Appliance’s
    goal is to deliver complete network storage solutions to
    customers. Our partners are vital to our success in this area,
    and we have significant partner relationships with database and
    business application companies including Dassault Catia,
    Documentum, EDS/PLM Solutions, several units within IBM

•

Global service and support.

Network Appliance’s increasing
    number of enterprise customers requires a global, integrated
    service and support model. These requirements have been met by
    expanding efforts in professional services and support
    offerings, as well as by continuing to develop strategic
    partnerships. Our partnerships with service providers such as
    Accenture, Computer Sciences Corporation, and IBM Global
    Services allow us to better serve customers by broadening
    service offerings, as well as leveraging existing service and
    support relationships that customers may already have in place.

Classes of Data

NetApp products and solutions are based on the
premise that not all data is created equal. Enterprise customers
face a significant challenge in designing networked storage
infrastructures that balance the availability requirements of
their applications and associated data with the cost of the
storage solution. Storing all data on an expensive, monolithic,
mainframe-class array is no longer acceptable to customers who
must carefully evaluate the value of their information. As a
result, data is being classified by availability and performance
requirements in relation to cost.



•

Archive data.

Enterprises require a very low-cost
    storage solution for archive data and backups, which have
    historically been stored on magnetic tape. Many customers are
    now storing archive data on more flexible disk-based systems,
    such as the NetApp NearStore

TM

, which reduces backup
    windows and enables rapid recovery in the event of a disaster.

Network Appliance solutions meet the needs of
archive, reference, departmental/remote office, business
internal, business operations, and business critical data with a
common product architecture and data management methodology,
enabling customers to easily deploy and manage all their
networked storage infrastructure in the same way.

System Products

NetApp products consist of fabric-attached
storage (FAS) appliances, also known as filers, NearStore
systems, NetCache® content delivery appliances, data
management and content delivery software, and professional and
support services. Our configured appliances range in price from
$4,000 to more than $1,000,000.

All NetApp systems come packaged in
rack-mountable enclosures that can be installed in a
customer’s existing server racks or factory-installed and
configured in cabinets. Our appliances are based primarily on
commodity hardware, including Intel® Pentium®
processors, an advanced implementation of the industry-standard
PCI bus architecture, standard Ethernet adapters, and either
Fibre Channel-Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL), Advanced Technology
Attachment (ATA), or Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) disk
interconnects.

Filers

NetApp filers are scalable, highly available,
field-proven, unified networked storage systems for data storage
and simplifying data management. The filer appliances are easy
to install, configure, and manage. They are specifically
designed for highly scalable, network-centric IT system
architectures, and support both network-attached storage
(“NAS”) and storage-attached networks
(“SAN”) on a single, unified platform. Our filers are
designed for and deliver lower total cost of ownership than
alternative competitive systems. Heterogeneous data sharing
allows our systems to deliver simultaneous data access to Linux,
UNIX, Windows, and Web-based servers and clients, dramatically
lowering the total cost of ownership and management complexity
versus homogeneous storage systems. Filers are available in
either single-node configurations or fully redundant,
active/active cluster configurations that provide high data
availability for business-critical environments.

Current filer products include:

•

NetApp FAS 960c/FAS960 enterprise servers.

Introduced during fiscal year 2003 and

backup/restore solutions. The product complements and
significantly improves existing tape backup processes by
inserting economical and simple-to-use disk-based storage
between application storage and tape libraries, resulting in a
highly efficient two-stage backup configuration. Unlike
alternative technologies, recovery time is measured in seconds
and minutes, not hours and days. Almost any type of primary
storage can be backed up to NearStore systems, including UNIX,
Linux, or Windows servers with direct-attached or SAN-attached
storage from all other storage vendors, desktop and notebook
computers, and NetApp filers. NearStore can also be used as a
mirror



target within a data center, or for mirroring
data from distributed offices or branches to a central location
in a fully heterogeneous, platform-independent architecture.

NearStore systems are also ideal for
consolidating nearline data resources, including reference and
archive data into a single storage platform. This platform can

Segment and Geographic Information

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financials
Statements accompanying this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Seasonality

Although operating results have not been
materially and adversely affected by seasonality in the past,
because of the significant seasonal effects experienced within
the industry, particularly in Europe, our future operating
results could be materially adversely affected by seasonality.
See “Risk Factors — Factors beyond our control
could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate” and
“Risks inherent in our international operations



could have a material adverse effect on our
operating results” accompanying this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Sales and Marketing

Network Appliance markets and distributes
products globally in over 90 countries employing a multichannel
distribution strategy, which focuses on product sales to end
users through a direct sales force, value-added resellers,
system integrators, and original equipment manufacturers (OEM).
In North America, we employ all forms of distribution previously
mentioned, with a focus on direct sales to our strategic and
named accounts. In Europe, we employ a mix of resellers and
direct sales channels to sell to end users. In Asia, our
products are primarily sold through resellers, which are
supported by channel sales representatives and technical support
personnel. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of net
sales in fiscal 2003, 2002, or 2001.

Backlog

Network Appliance manufactures products based on
a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of
our customers’ demand. Orders are generally placed by
customers on an as-needed basis. Products are typically shipped
within one to four weeks following receipt of an order. In
certain circumstances, customers may cancel or reschedule orders
without penalty. For these reasons, “orders” may not
constitute a firm backlog and may not be a meaningful indicator
of revenues.

Manufacturing

Manufacturing operations, with insourced and
outsourced locations in Sunnyvale, California, and Glasgow,
Scotland, include materials procurement, commodity management,
component engineering, test engineering, manufacturing
engineering, product assembly, product assurance, quality
control, and final test. We rely on many suppliers for
materials, as well as several key subcontractors for the
production of certain subassemblies and finished systems. Our
strategy has been to develop close relationships with our
suppliers, exchanging critical information and implementing
joint quality-training programs. We also use contract
manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies to
improve our manufacturing redundancy. See “Risk
Factors — We rely on a limited number of
suppliers” and “Risk Factors — The loss of
our contract manufacturers.” This manufacturing strategy
minimizes capital investment and overhead expenditures and
creates flexibility for rapid expansion. We were awarded the ISO
9001 certification on May 29, 1997, and continue to be
ISO-certified.

Research and Development

During fiscal year 2003, Network Appliance
launched unified storage platforms designed to support both SAN
and NAS simultaneously. We introduced a number of new systems,
including the F825 midrange filer, the FAS940 and FAS960
high-end filers, the NetCache C1200 and C2100, and the NearStore
R150, which continues to define a new category of storage
solution. We completed the development of the new FAS250
entry-level enterprise filer, and began delivery to customers in
the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. We also launched new
software products that significantly improve data management
capabilities, provide new solutions in the areas of data
protection and backup and recovery, and enable new business
continuance functionality.

See “Risk Factors — If we are
unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to
technological change, or if our new products do not achieve
market acceptance, our operating results could be materially
adversely affected.”

Competition

The storage and content delivery markets are
intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing
technology.



In the storage market, our FAS appliances and
data management software compete primarily against storage
products and data management software from EMC Corporation,
Hitachi Data Systems, Hewlett-Packard Company (including the
integrated Compaq Computer Corporation), IBM Corporation, and
Sun Microsystems, Inc. We have also historically encountered
less-frequent competition from companies including Dell, LSI
Logic Corp., MTI Corp., Procom Technology, and Silicon Graphics,
Inc.

In the content delivery market, our NetCache
appliances and content delivery software compete against caching
appliance and content delivery software vendors including Akamai
Technologies, Inc., BlueCoat Systems (formerly CacheFlow, Inc.),
and Cisco Systems, Inc.

Additionally a number of new, privately held
companies are currently attempting to enter the storage and
content delivery markets, some of which may become significant
competitors in the future.

We believe that the principal competitive factors
affecting the storage and content delivery markets include
product benefits such as response time, reliability, data
availability, scalability, ease of use, price, multiprotocol
capabilities, and customer service and support.

See “Risk Factors — An increase in
competition could materially adversely affect our operating
results” and “If we are unable to develop and
introduce new products and respond to technological change, or
if our new products do not achieve market acceptance.”

Proprietary Rights

We currently rely on a combination of copyright
and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures,
contractual provisions, and patents to protect our proprietary
rights. We seek to protect our software, documentation, and
other written materials under trade secret, copyright, and
patent laws, which afford only limited protection. We have
registered our Network Appliance name and logo, FAServer®,
FilerView, NetApp, NetCache, SecureShare® SnapManager,
SnapMirror, SnapRestore, and WAFL as trademarks in the United
States (“U.S.”). Other U.S. trademarks and some of the
other U.S. registered trademarks are registered internationally
as well. We will continue to evaluate the registration of
additional trademarks as appropriate. We generally enter into
confidentiality agreements with our employees, resellers, and
customers. We currently have multiple U.S. and international
patent applications pending and multiple U.S. patents issued.
See “Risk Factors — If we are unable to protect
our intellectual property, we may be subject to increased
competition that could materially adversely affect our operating
results.”

Employees

As of April 25, 2003, we had 2,345
employees. Of the total, 1,199 were in sales and marketing, 526
in research and development, 283 in finance and administration,
and 337 in manufacturing and customer service operations. Our
future performance depends in significant part on our key
technical and senior management personnel, none of whom is bound
by an employment agreement. We have never had a work stoppage
and consider relations with our employees to be good.

Risk Factors

The following risk factors and other
information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties
described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks
and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently
deem less significant may also impair our business operations.
Please see page [3] of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
for additional discussion of these forward-looking statements.
If any of the following risks actually occur, our business,
operating results, and financial condition could be materially
adversely affected.

Factors beyond our control could cause our
    quarterly results to fluctuate.

We believe that period-to-period comparisons of
our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and
should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance.
Many of the factors that could cause our quarterly operating
results to fluctuate significantly in the future are beyond our
control and include, but are not limited to, the following:

In addition, sales for any future quarter may
vary and accordingly be inconsistent with our plans. We
manufacture products based on a combination of specific order
requirements and forecasts of our customer



demands. Products are typically shipped within
one to four weeks following receipt of an order. In certain
circumstances, customers may cancel or reschedule orders without
penalty. Product sales are also difficult to forecast because
the network storage market is rapidly evolving and our sales
cycle varies substantially from customer to customer.

Due to all of the foregoing factors, it is
possible that in one or more future quarters our results may
fall below the expectations of public market analysts and
investors. In such event, the trading price of our common stock
would likely decrease.

Our gross margins may vary based on the
    configuration of our products, and such variation may make it
    more difficult to forecast our earnings.

We derive a significant portion of our sales from
the resale of disk drives as components of our filers, and the
resale market for hard disk drives is highly competitive and
subject to intense pricing pressures. Our sales of disk drives
generate lower gross margin percentages than those of our filer
products. As a result, as we sell more highly configured systems
with greater disk drive content, overall gross margin
percentages may be negatively affected.

Our gross margins have been and may continue to
be affected by a variety of other factors, including:

A significant percentage of our expenses
    are fixed, which could affect our net income.

Our expense levels are based in part on our
expectations as to future sales and a significant percentage of
our expenses are fixed. As a result, if sales levels are below
expectations or previously higher levels, net income will be
disproportionately affected in a material and adverse manner.

Cost and expense control may be critical to
    maintaining positive cash flow from operations and
    profitability.

In fiscal 2002, we reduced fixed costs through
workforce reductions and a consolidation of facilities. We
believe strict cost containment is essential to maintaining
positive cash flow from operations and remaining profitable in
future quarters, especially since the outlook for future
quarters is uncertain. Additional measures to reduce expenses
may be undertaken if revenues and market conditions do not
improve. A number of factors could preclude us from successfully
bringing costs and expenses in line with our revenues, such as
our inability to accurately forecast business activities and
deterioration of our revenues. If we are not able to effectively
control our costs and achieve an expense structure commensurate
with our business activities and revenues, our cash flow and net
income will be adversely affected.



Our future financial performance depends on
    growth in the network storage and content delivery markets; if
    these markets do not continue to grow at the rates at which we
    forecast growth, our operating results will be materially and
    adversely impacted.

All of our products address the storage and
content delivery markets. Accordingly, our future financial
performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the
storage and content delivery markets and on our ability to adapt
to emerging standards in these markets. We cannot assure you
that the markets for storage and content delivery will continue
to grow or that emerging standards in these markets will not
adversely affect the growth of UNIX, Windows, and the World Wide
Web server markets upon which we depend. In addition, our
business also depends on general economic and business
conditions. A reduction in demand for network storage and
content delivery caused by weakening economic conditions and
decreases in corporate spending have resulted in decreased
revenues and lower revenue growth rates. The network storage and
content delivery market growth declined significantly beginning
in the third quarter of fiscal 2001, causing both our revenues
and operating results to decline. If the network storage and
content delivery markets grow more slowly than anticipated or if
emerging standards other than those adopted by us become
increasingly accepted by these markets, our operating results
could be materially adversely affected.

The market price for our common stock has
    fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to
    do so in the future.

The market price for our common stock has
experienced substantial volatility in the past, and several
factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the
future. These factors include:

In addition, the stock market has experienced
volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of
equity securities of many high-technology companies.
Additionally, certain macroeconomic factors such as changes in
interest rates, the market climate for the high-technology
sector, and levels of corporate spending on information
technology could also have an impact on the trading price of our
stock. As a result, the market price of our common stock may
fluctuate significantly in the future and any broad market
decline, as well as our own operating results, may materially
adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

If we are unable to develop and introduce
    new products and respond to technological change, if our new
    products do not achieve market acceptance, or if we fail to
    manage the transition between our new and old products, our
    operating results could be materially adversely
    affected.

Our future growth depends upon the successful
development and introduction of new hardware and software
products. Due to the complexity of storage subsystems and
Internet caching devices, and the difficulty in gauging the
engineering effort required to produce new products, such
products are subject to significant technical risks. However, we
cannot assure you that any of our new products will achieve
market acceptance. Additional product introductions in future
periods may also impact the sales of existing products. In
addition, our new products must respond to technological changes
and evolving industry standards. If we are unable, for
technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new
products in a timely manner in



response to changing market conditions or
customer requirements, or if such products do not achieve market
acceptance, our operating results could be materially adversely
affected.

In particular, in conjunction with the
introduction of our product offerings in the fabric-attached
storage market, we introduced products with new features and
functionality that address the storage area network market.
During fiscal 2003, we introduced iSCSI-enabled unified storage
solutions. We also introduced Direct Access File System (DAFS)
protocol-capable products and NearStore backup and recovery
products during fiscal 2002. We face risks relating to these
product introductions, including risks relating to forecasting
of demand for such products, as well as possible product and
software defects and a potentially different sales and support
environment associated with selling these new systems. If any of
the foregoing occur, our operating results could be adversely
affected.

As new or enhanced products are introduced, we
must successfully manage the transition from older products in
order to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering
patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories,
and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered
to meet customers’ demands.

Our business could be materially adversely
    affected as a result of a natural disaster, terrorist acts, or
    other catastrophic event.

Our operations, including our suppliers’ and
contract manufacturers’ operations, are susceptible to
outages due to fire, floods, power loss, power shortages,
telecommunications failures, break-ins, and similar events. In
addition, our headquarters are located in Northern California,
an area susceptible to earthquakes. If any significant disaster
were to occur, our ability to operate our business could be
impaired.

Weak economic conditions or terrorist actions
could lead to significant business interruptions. If such
disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders, a
general decrease in corporate spending on information
technology, or direct impacts on our marketing, manufacturing,
financial functions, or our suppliers’ logistics function,
our results of operations and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

We depend on attracting and retaining
    qualified technical and sales personnel; if we are unable to
    attract and retain such personnel, our operating results could
    be materially and adversely impacted.

Our continued success depends, in part, on our
ability to identify, attract, motivate, and retain qualified
technical and sales personnel. Because our future success is
dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce
new products, we are particularly dependent on our ability to
identify, attract, motivate, and retain qualified engineers with
the requisite education, backgrounds, and industry experience.
In spite of the economic downturn, competition for qualified
engineers, particularly in Silicon Valley, can be intense. The
loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or
sales people could be disruptive to our development efforts or
business relationships and could materially adversely affect our
operating results.

Risks inherent in our international
    operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating
    results.

We conduct business internationally. For fiscal
2003, approximately 42.1% of our total revenues were from
international customers (including U.S. exports). Accordingly,
our future operating results could be materially adversely
affected by a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our
control, including regulatory, political, or economic conditions
in a specific country or region, trade protection measures and
other regulatory requirements, government spending patterns, and
acts of terrorism and international conflicts.

Our international sales are denominated in U.S.
dollars and in foreign currencies. An increase in the value of
the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our
products more expensive and, therefore, potentially less
competitive in foreign markets. For international sales and
expenditures denominated in foreign currencies, we are subject
to risks associated with currency fluctuations. We hedge risks
associated with foreign currency transactions in order to
minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange
rates on earnings. We utilize forward contracts to hedge our
currency exposure associated with certain assets



and liabilities as well as anticipated foreign
currency cash flow. All balance sheet hedges are marked to
market through earnings every period, while gains and losses on
cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income.
There can be no assurance that such hedging strategy will be
successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not
have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

Additional risks inherent in our international
business activities generally include, among others, longer
accounts receivable payment cycles, difficulties in managing
international operations, and potentially adverse tax
consequences. Such factors could materially adversely affect our
future international sales and, consequently, our operating
results.

Although operating results have not been
materially adversely affected by seasonality in the past,
because of the significant seasonal effects experienced within
the industry, particularly in Europe, our future operating
results could be materially adversely affected by seasonality.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to
maintain or increase international market demand for our
products.

An increase in competition could materially
    adversely affect our operating results.

The storage and content delivery markets are
intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing
technology.

In the storage market, our FAS appliances and
data management software compete primarily against storage
products and data management software from EMC Corporation,
Hitachi Data Systems, Hewlett-Packard Company (including the
integrated Compaq Computer Corporation), IBM Corporation, and
Sun Microsystems, Inc. We have also historically encountered
less-frequent competition from companies including Dell, LSI
Logic Corp., MTI Corp., Procom Technology and Silicon Graphics,
Inc.

In the content delivery market, our NetCache
appliances and content delivery software compete against caching
appliance and content delivery software vendors including Akamai
Technologies, Inc., BlueCoat Systems (formerly Cacheflow, Inc.)
and Cisco Systems, Inc.

Additionally a number of new, privately held
companies are currently attempting to enter the storage and
content delivery markets, some of which may become significant
competitors in the future.

We believe that the principal competitive factors
affecting the storage and content delivery markets include
product benefits such as response time, reliability, data
availability, scalability, ease of use, price, multiprotocol
capabilities, and customer service and support. Although we
believe that our products currently compete favorably with
respect to these factors, we cannot assure you that we can
maintain our competitive position against current and potential
competitors, especially those with significantly greater
financial, marketing, service, support, technical, and other
resources.

Increased competition could result in price
reductions, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, any
of which could materially adversely affect our operating
results. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly
than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in
customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the
development, promotion, sale, and support of their products. In
addition, current and potential competitors have established or
may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with
third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors
or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire
significant market share. We cannot assure you that we will be
able to compete successfully against current or future
competitors. Competitive pressures we face could materially
adversely affect our operating results.

We rely on a limited number of suppliers,
    and any disruption or termination of these supply arrangements
    could delay shipment of our products and could materially
    adversely affect our operating results.

We rely on a limited number of suppliers of
several key components utilized in the assembly of our products.
We purchase most of our disk drives through a single supplier.
We purchase computer boards and



microprocessors from a limited number of
suppliers. Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers
involves several risks, including:

Component quality is particularly significant
with respect to our suppliers of disk drives. In order to meet
product performance requirements, we must obtain disk drives of
extremely high quality and capacity. In addition, there are
periodic supply-and-demand issues for disk drives,
microprocessors, and for semiconductor memory components, which
could result in component shortages, selective supply
allocations, and increased prices of such components. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to obtain our full requirements
of such components in the future or that prices of such
components will not increase. In addition, problems with respect
to yield and quality of such components and timeliness of
deliveries could occur. Disruption or termination of the supply
of these components could delay shipments of our products and
could materially adversely affect our operating results. Such
delays could also damage relationships with current and
prospective customers.

In addition, we license certain technology and
software from third parties that is incorporated into our
products. If we are unable to obtain or license the technology
and software on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver
product to our customers in a timely manner.

The loss of any contract manufacturers or
    the failure to accurately forecast demand for our products or
    successfully manage our relationship with our contract
    manufacturers could negatively impact our ability to manufacture
    and sell our products.

We currently rely on several contract
manufacturers to manufacture most of our products. Our reliance
on our third-party contract manufacturers reduces our control
over the manufacturing process, exposing us to risks including
reduced control over quality assurance, production costs, and
product supply. If we should fail to effectively manage our
relationship with our contract manufacturers, or if our contract
manufacturers experience delays, disruptions, capacity
constraints, or quality control problems in their manufacturing
operations, our ability to ship products to our customers could
be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could be
harmed. Qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing
volume production are expensive and time-consuming. If we are
required to change contract manufacturers or assume internal
manufacturing operations, we may lose revenue and damage our
customer relationships. If we inaccurately forecast demand for
our products, we may have excess or inadequate inventory, or
incur cancellation charges or penalties, which could adversely
impact our operating results.

We intend to regularly introduce new products and
product enhancements, which will require us to rapidly achieve
volume production by coordinating with our contract
manufacturers and suppliers. We may need to increase our
material purchases, contract manufacturing capacity, and
internal test and quality functions to meet anticipated demand.
The inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with
adequate supplies of high-quality products, or the inability to
obtain raw materials, could cause a delay in our ability to
fulfill orders.

If we are unable to maintain our existing
    relationships and develop new relationships with major strategic
    partners, our revenue may be impacted negatively.

An element of our strategy to enhance revenue is
to strategically partner with major third-party software and
hardware vendors who integrate our products into their products
and also comarket our products. A number of these strategic
partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to
segments of the storage



market. There is intense competition for
attractive strategic partners, and even if we can establish
strategic relationships with these partners, we cannot assure
you that these partnerships will generate significant revenue or
that the partnerships will continue to be in effect for any
specific period of time.

We intend to continue to establish and maintain
business relationships with technology companies to accelerate
the development and marketing of our storage solutions. To the
extent we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships and
maintaining our existing relationships, our future revenue and
operating results could be impacted negatively. In addition, the
loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse effect
on the progress of new products under development with that
partner.

We may incur problems with current or
    future equity investments and acquisitions, and these
    investments may not achieve our objectives.

From time to time, we make equity investments for
the promotion of business and strategic objectives. We have
already made strategic investments in a number of network
storage-related technology companies. Equity investments may
result in the loss of investment capital. The market price and
valuation of our equity investments in these companies may
fluctuate due to market conditions and other circumstances over
which we have little or no control, and recent events have
adversely affected the public equity market. To the extent that
the fair value of these securities is less than our cost over an
extended period of time, our results of operations and financial
position could be negatively impacted. In fiscal 2003, we
recorded a non-cash, other-than-temporary write-down of
$0.7 million related to the impairment of our investment in
a publicly traded company. In the second quarter of fiscal 2002,
we recorded a noncash, other-than-temporary write-down of
$13.0 million related to impairments in publicly traded and
private companies.

As part of our strategy, we are continuously
evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies
that would complement our current products, expand the breadth
of our markets, or enhance our technical capabilities. We have
acquired two companies since the beginning of fiscal 2001. We
may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our
stockholders’ investments and cause us to use cash, to
incur debt, or to assume contingent liabilities.

Acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks,
and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired
operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies,
economies of scale, or other value. In addition, we may
experience a diversion of management’s attention, the loss
of key employees of acquired operations, or the inability to
recover strategic investments in development stage entities. Any
such problems could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operation.

In addition, we adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) 142

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”

which
changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method
to an impairment-only approach. As of May 1, 2002, the fair
value for each of our reporting units exceeded the reporting
unit’s carrying amount and no impairment was recognized. On
an ongoing basis, goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment
(or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise). As of
April 30, 2003, there had been no impairment of goodwill
and intangible assets. There can be no assurance that future
impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings. See
Note 13 under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We do not have exclusive relationships with
    our resellers and accordingly there is a risk that those
    resellers may give higher priority to products of other
    suppliers, which could materially adversely affect our operating
    results.

Our reseller partners generally offer products
from several different companies, including products of our
competitors. Accordingly, there is risk that these resellers may
give higher priority to products of other suppliers, which could
materially adversely affect our operating results.



Undetected software, hardware errors, or
    failures found in new products may result in loss of or delay in
    market acceptance of our products, which could increase our
    costs and reduce our revenues.

Our products may contain undetected software,
hardware errors, or failures when first introduced or as new
versions are released. Despite testing by us and by current and
potential customers, errors may not be found in new products
until after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in
loss of or delay in market acceptance, which could materially
adversely affect our operating results.

If actual results or events differ
    materially from those contemplated by us in making estimates and
    assumptions, our reported financial condition and results of
    operation for future periods could be materially
    affected.

The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements and related disclosure in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to establish policies that contain estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
describes the significant accounting policies essential to
preparing our consolidated financial statements. The preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. We
base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that
we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
future results may differ materially from these estimates. We
evaluate, on an ongoing basis, our estimates and assumptions. In
addition, see our Critical Accounting Policies under Item 7.

If we are unable to protect our
    intellectual property, we may be subject to increased
    competition that could materially adversely affect our operating
    results.

Our success depends significantly upon our
proprietary technology. We currently rely on a combination of
copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality
procedures, contractual provisions, and patents to protect our
proprietary rights. We seek to protect our software,
documentation, and other written materials under trade secret,
copyright, and patent laws, which afford only limited
protection. Some U.S. trademarks and some U.S.-registered
trademarks are registered internationally as well. We will
continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks
as appropriate. We generally enter into confidentiality
agreements with our employees and with our resellers, strategic
partners, and customers. We currently have multiple U.S. and
international patent applications pending and multiple
U.S. patents issued. The pending applications may not be
approved and if patents are issued, such patents may be
challenged. If such challenges are brought, the patents may be
invalidated. We cannot assure you that we will develop
proprietary products or technologies that are patentable, that
any issued patent will provide us with any competitive
advantages or will not be challenged by third parties, or that
the patents of others will not materially adversely affect our
ability to do business.

Litigation may be necessary to protect our
proprietary technology. Any such litigation may be
time-consuming and costly. Despite our efforts to protect our
proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy
aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we
regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign
countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an
extent as do the laws of the U.S. We cannot assure you that our
means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or
that our competitors will not independently develop similar
technology, duplicate our products, or design around patents
issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours.

We are subject to intellectual property
infringement claims. We may, from time to time, receive claims
that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property
rights. Third parties may in the future claim infringement by us
with respect to current or future products, patents, trademarks,
or other proprietary rights. We expect that companies in the
appliance market will increasingly be subject to infringement
claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry
segment grows and the functionality of products in different
industry segments overlaps. Any such claims could be
time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product
shipment delays, require us to redesign our products or require
us to enter into royalty or



licensing agreements, any of which could
materially adversely affect our operating results. Such royalty
or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on
terms acceptable to us or at all.

Item 2.

Properties

Our headquarters site for corporate general
administration, sales and marketing, research and development,
customer services, and manufacturing operations occupies
approximately 675,000 square feet of buildings in
Sunnyvale, California. In fiscal 2002, we terminated our
operating lease obligations for our Sunnyvale headquarters site
by purchasing the land and buildings for $249.8 million.

We lease other sales offices and research and
development facilities throughout the U.S. and internationally.
We believe that our existing facilities and those being
developed in Sunnyvale are adequate for our requirements over at
least the next two years and that additional space will be
available as needed.

As a result of reductions in headcount in fiscal
2002, we have exited office space under noncancellable leases in
both the U.S. and Europe. If we are unable to successfully
sublease our vacated and unoccupied office space, our operating
results may be adversely affected. See Note 12 to our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

See additional discussion regarding properties in
“Note 4 under Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” and “Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and
litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We defend
ourselves vigorously against any such claims. While the outcome
of these matters is currently not determinable, management does
not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will
have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Item 4.

Submissions of Matters to a Vote of
    Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security
holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

PART II

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity
    and Related Stockholder Matters

Our common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq
National Market on November 21, 1995, and is traded under
the symbol “NTAP.” As of April 25, 2003, there
were 1,016 holders of record of the common stock. The following
table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low
closing sale prices for our common stock as reported on the
Nasdaq National Market.

We believe that a number of factors may cause the
market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. See
“Item 1. Business — Risk Factors.”

We have never paid cash dividends on our capital
stock. We currently anticipate retaining all available funds, if
any, to finance internal growth and product development as well
as other management initiatives, including stock repurchases and
acquisitions. Payment of dividends in the future will depend
upon our



earnings and financial condition and such other
factors as the directors may consider or deem appropriate at the
time.

Item 6.

Selected Consolidated Financial
    Data

Five fiscal years ended April 30,

All Net Income per Share amounts have been
adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock splits which were
effective November 11, 1997, December 21, 1998,
December 20, 1999 and March 22, 2000.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read together with
the financial statements and the related notes set forth under
“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data” and the Risk Factors set forth in
“Item 1. Business.”

Code of
    Business Conduct and Ethics

We maintain a code of business conduct and ethics
for directors, officers and employees, and will promptly
disclose any waivers of the code for directors or executive
officers. Our code of business practices addresses conflicts of
interest; confidentiality; compliance with laws, rules and
regulations (including insider trading laws); and related
matters.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations is based upon our
Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The preparation of these Consolidated
Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues, and expenses, and related disclosure. We evaluate, on
an ongoing basis, our estimates and judgments, including those
related to sales returns, bad debts, excess inventory and
purchase commitments, investments, intangible assets, lease
losses and restructuring accruals, income taxes, and
contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience
and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

We believe the accounting policies described
below, among others, are the ones that most frequently require
us to make estimates and judgments, and therefore are critical
to the understanding of our results of operations:

•

revenue recognition and allowances;

•

inventory write-down;

•

restructuring accruals;



Revenue
    Recognition and Allowances

We apply the provisions of SOP 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition”

and related
interpretations to all revenue transactions. We recognize
revenue when:

For arrangements with multiple elements, we
allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based
on vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered items.
We defer the portion of the arrangement fee equal to the fair
value of the undelivered elements until they are delivered.
Vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged
when the element is sold separately.

A typical arrangement includes product, software
subscription, and maintenance. Some arrangements include
training and consulting. Software subscriptions include
unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a
when-and-if-available basis, bug fixes, and patch releases, and
are included in product revenues. Service maintenance includes
contracts for technical support and hardware maintenance.
Revenue from software subscriptions and service is recognized
ratably over the contractual term, generally one to three years.
Revenue from training and consulting is recognized as the
services are performed.

We record reductions to revenue for estimated
sales returns at the time of shipment. These estimates are based
on historical sales returns, changes in customer demand, and
other factors. If actual future returns and allowances differ
from past experience, additional allowances may be required.

Allowance for
    Doubtful Accounts

We also maintain a separate allowance for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment
of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the
aging of the accounts receivable. We analyze accounts receivable
and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer
solvency, current economic and geographic trends, and changes in
customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the
adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. If the
financial condition of our customers deteriorates, resulting in
an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional
allowances may be required.



Inventory
    Write-down

We write down inventory and record purchase
commitment liabilities for estimated excess and obsolete
inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory
and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future
demand and market conditions. Although we strive for accuracy in
our forecasts of future product demand, any significant
unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments
could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory
and commitments, and our reported results. If actual market
conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional
write-downs and other charges against earnings may be required.
If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may realize
higher gross margin in the period when the written-down
inventory is sold.

We engage in extensive product quality programs
and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the
quality of our component suppliers. We also provide for the
estimated cost of known product failures based on known quality
issues when they arise. Should actual cost of product failure
differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated liability
would be required.

Restructuring
    Accruals

In fiscal 2002, as a result of continuing
unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in IT spending
rates, we implemented two restructuring plans, which included
reductions in workforce and a consolidation of facilities. These
restructuring accruals were accounted for in accordance with
EITF Issue No. 94-3,

Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)

, and included various assumptions such as the
time period over which the facilities will be vacant, expected
sublease terms, and expected sublease rates. These estimates are
reviewed and revised periodically and may result in a
substantial change to restructuring expense should different
conditions prevail than were anticipated in original management
estimates. See Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion.

Loss
    Contingencies

We are subject to the possibility of various loss
contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We
consider the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or
the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to
reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss
contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it
is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has
been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably
estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available
to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.

Impairment
    Losses on Investments

We perform periodic reviews of our investments
for impairment. Our investments in publicly held companies are
generally considered impaired when a decline in the fair value
of an investment as measured by quoted market prices is less
than its carrying value, and such a decline is not considered
temporary. Our investments in privately held companies are
considered impaired when a review of the investees’
operations and other indicators of impairment indicate that the
carrying value of the investment is not likely to be
recoverable. Such indicators include, but are not limited to,
limited capital resources, limited prospects of receiving
additional financing, and limited prospects for liquidity of the
related securities. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we
recorded a non-cash, other-than-temporary write-down of $0.7
million related to impairments of our investments in a publicly
traded company. In the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we
recorded a non-cash, other-than-temporary write-down of
$13.0 million related to impairments of our investments in
publicly traded and private companies.

Accounting for Stock-based
Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principle Board
Opinion No. 25 (“APB” No. 25),

Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees

, and comply with the
disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123

“Accounting
for



Stock-Based
Compensation,”

as amended by
SFAS 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosures.

Deferred compensation recognized under APB No. 25
is amortized to expense using the graded vesting method. We
account for stock options issued to non-employees in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and
EITF No. 96-18 under the fair value based method.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

The determination of our tax provision is subject
to judgments and estimates due to operations in several tax
jurisdictions outside the U.S. Earnings derived from our
international business are generally taxed at rates that are
lower than U.S. rates, resulting in a reduction of our
effective tax rate. The ability to maintain our current
effective tax rate is contingent upon existing tax laws in both
the U.S. and in the respective countries in which our
international subsidiaries are located. Future changes in
domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued
realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving and
expect to receive from international business. In addition, a
decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from our
international business or in the mix of international business
among particular tax jurisdictions could increase our overall
effective tax rate. Also, our current effective tax rate assumes
that U.S. income taxes are not provided for undistributed
earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. These earnings
could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or
federal and state income taxes should they be either deemed or
actually remitted to the U.S.

The carrying value of our net deferred tax
assets, which is made up primarily of income tax deductions,
credits, and net operating loss carryforwards resulting from
stock option exercises, assumes that we will be able to generate
sufficient future income to fully utilize these tax deductions
and credits. If we do not generate sufficient future income, the
realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired
resulting in additional income tax expense. We have provided a
valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets
because of uncertainty regarding their realizability due to
expectation of future employee stock option exercises.

New Accounting Standards

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 146,

“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities,”

which addresses accounting for
restructuring and similar costs. SFAS No. 146 supersedes
previous accounting guidance, principally EITF Issue
No. 94-3. The Company adopted the provisions of
SFAS No. 146 for restructuring activities initiated
after December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 146 requires
that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal
activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under
EITF Issue No. 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was
recognized at the date of the Company’s commitment to an
exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the
liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair
value. Accordingly, SFAS No. 146 may affect the timing
of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts
recognized.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 45,

“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others”

(“FIN 45”).
FIN 45 requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair
value and requires a guarantor to make disclosures, even when
the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is
remote. For those guarantees and indemnifications that do not
fall within initial recognition and measurement requirements of
FIN 45, the Company must continue to monitor the conditions
that are subject to the guarantees and indemnifications, as
required under existing generally accepted accounting
principles, to identify if a loss has been incurred. If the
Company determines that it is probable that a loss has been
incurred, any such estimable loss would be recognized. The
initial recognition and measurement requirements do not apply to
the Company’s product warranties or to the provisions
contained in the majority of the Company’s software license
agreements that indemnify licensees of the Company’s
software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging
that the Company’s software infringes the intellectual
property rights of a third party. The Company has provided
disclosures for the year ended April 30, 2003 as required
by FIN 45 in Note 14 to its consolidated financial
statements. The Company does not expect adoption of the
liability recognition provisions to have a material impact on
its financial position or results of operations.



In December 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on
EITF 00-21,

“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables.”

This issue addresses certain aspects of
the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will
perform multiple revenue-generating activities. In some
arrangements, the different revenue-generating activities
(deliverables) are sufficiently separable and there exists
sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account
for some or all of the deliverables (that is, there are separate
units of accounting). In other arrangements, some or all of the
deliverables are not independently functional, or there is not
sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them
separately. This issue addresses when and, if so, how an
arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided
into separate units of accounting. This issue does not change
otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria. The guidance
in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into
in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The
Company does not expect that the adoption of EITF 00-21 will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure, an amendment to FASB Statement
123.”

SFAS 148 provides alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method
of accounting of stock-based employee compensation. In addition,
SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of
SFAS 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,”

to require prominent disclosures in both
annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect
of the method used on reported results. The Company adopted the
disclosure provisions of SFAS 148 effective April 30,
2003.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 46 (“FIN 46”),

“Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities.”

FIN 46 requires an
investor with a majority of the variable interests in a variable
interest entity to consolidate the entity and also requires
majority and significant variable interest investors to provide
certain disclosures. A variable interest entity is an entity in
which the equity investors do not have a controlling interest or
the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the
entity’s activities without receiving additional
subordinated financial support from the other parties. The
Company does not expect to identify any variable interest
entities that must be consolidated.

In April 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 149,

“Amendment of SFAS No. 133
on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”

SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies accounting for
derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under
SFAS No. 133. In particular, this Statement clarifies
under what circumstances a contract with an initial net
investment meets the characteristic of a derivative. It also
clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that
warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows.
SFAS No. 149 is generally effective for contracts
entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and is not
expected to have an impact on the Company upon adoption.

In May 2003, the FASB has issued
SFAS No. 150,

“Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities
and Equity.”

The Statement improves the accounting for
certain financial instruments that, under previous guidance,
issuers could account for as equity. The new Statement requires
that those instruments be classified as liabilities in
statements of financial position. This statement is effective
for interim periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The
Company is currently evaluating the effect of this statement on
its consolidated financial statement. The Company does not
expect that the adoption of SFAS 150 will have a material
effect on its consolidated financial statements.

Non-Audit Services Provided by Independent
Auditors

During fiscal 2003, our independent auditors,
Deloitte & Touche LLP, performed the following
non-audit services that have been approved by our Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors: local statutory audits and
certain taxation matters. See more detailed disclosure in the
Proxy Statement.



Results of Operations

The following table sets forth certain
consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of
total revenues for the periods indicated:

Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002

Product
revenues

— Product revenues
increased by 9.9% to $802.3 million in fiscal 2003, from
$729.9 million in fiscal 2002. Product revenues growth was
across all geographies. This increase in product revenues was
specifically attributable to increased software licenses and
software subscriptions and an increase in units shipped, as
compared to the prior year.

Our revenue growth was primarily driven by new
product innovation as we continue to enhance and extend our
full-line enterprise portfolio, providing customers with a lower
overall cost of ownership. We expanded both our customer base
and strategic partnerships with enterprise infrastructure
providers and gained market acceptance for our new and expanded
unified storage, NearStore and NetCache products. We believe our
competitive advantage is a result of lower total cost of
ownership from a combination of four factors: lower acquisition
cost, reduced administrative overhead, minimized service cost,
and reduced downtime of critical business applications.



Product revenues were favorably impacted by the
following factors:

Product revenues were negatively impacted by the
following factors:

Service
revenues

— Service revenues,
which include hardware support, professional services, and
educational services, increased by 31.2% to $89.8 million
in fiscal 2003, from $68.5 million in fiscal 2002. Service
revenues are generally deferred and, in most cases, recognized
ratably over the service period obligations, which are typically
one to three years. The increase in service revenues
(representing 10.1% and 8.6% of total revenues for fiscal 2003
and 2002, respectively) was due to an increasing number of
enterprise customers, who typically purchase more complete
service packages. Higher service revenues was also related to a
growing installed base resulting in new customer support
contracts in addition to support contract renewals by existing
customers. While it is an element of our strategy to expand and
offer a more comprehensive, global enterprise support and
service solution, we cannot assure you that service revenue will
grow at the current rate in fiscal 2004.

International total revenues (including
U.S. exports) increased by 11.9% for fiscal 2003 as
compared to fiscal 2002. International total revenues were
$375.2 million, or 42.1% of total revenues for fiscal 2003.
The increase in international sales for fiscal 2003 was
primarily a result of European and Asia Pacific net revenues
growth, driven by larger storage implementations and new
products, and positive foreign exchange effects from a weak
U.S. dollar, as compared to the prior year.

Product gross
margin

— Product gross
margin increased to 65.1% of product revenues for fiscal 2003 as
compared to 63.3% in fiscal 2002. Amortization of existing
technology included in cost of product revenue was $5.5 and
$5.7 million, respectively, for fiscal 2003 and 2002. For
fiscal 2004, estimated future amortization expense is
$3.0 million and none thereafter.

Product gross margin was favorably impacted by:

•

favorable product and add-on software mix;

•

competitive pricing solutions with our core filer
    products bundled with software features;

•

higher average selling prices for our new
    products;



•

growth in software subscription upgrades and
    software licenses due primarily to a larger installed base and
    an increasing number of new enterprise customers; and

•

manufacturing cost management.

Product gross margin was negatively impacted by:

Service gross
margin

— Service gross
margin increased to 26.5% for fiscal 2003 compared to 18.2% for
fiscal 2002. Investments in customer service increased by 17.8%
to $66.0 million in fiscal 2003 from $56.0 million in
fiscal 2002. The improvement in service gross margin in fiscal
2003 was primarily due to operational and cost efficiencies in
the global customer service organizations, combined with the
ramping up of our service infrastructure in fiscal 2002 in
anticipation of service revenue growth.

Sales and
marketing

— Sales and
marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions,
advertising and promotional expenses, and certain customer
service and support costs. Sales and marketing expenses
increased 7.0% to $304.2 million for fiscal 2003, from
$284.4 million for fiscal 2002. These expenses were 34.2%
and 35.6% of total revenues for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002,
respectively. The increase was attributed to the continued
worldwide investment in our sales and customer service
organizations associated with selling complete solutions at the
enterprise level, marketing and various advertising programs,
and expenses associated with our growing mix of enterprise
customers and associated global account programs. Sales and
marketing headcount decreased to 1,199 in fiscal 2003, from
1,224 in fiscal 2002.

We expect to continue to selectively add sales
capacity in an effort to expand domestic and international
markets, introduce new products, establish and expand new
distribution channels, and increase product and company
awareness. We expect to increase our sales and marketing
expenses commensurate with future revenue growth.

Research and
development

— Research and
development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits,
prototype expenses, non-recurring engineering charges, and fees
paid to outside consultants. Research and development expenses
decreased 3.3% to $112.9 million in fiscal 2003, from
$116.7 million in fiscal 2002. These expenses represented
12.7% and 14.6% of total revenues for fiscal 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Research and development expenses decreased in
absolute dollars, primarily as a result of cost control,
reduction in discretionary spending efforts, the impact of
fiscal 2002 restructuring activities. Research and development
headcount increased to 526 in fiscal 2003, from 514 in fiscal
2002. We expect to continuously support current and future
product development and enhancement efforts, and incur
prototyping expenses and non-recurring engineering charges
associated with the development of new products and technologies.

We believe that our future performance will
depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our
current product line, develop new products that achieve market
acceptance, maintain technological competitiveness, and meet an
expanding range of customer requirements. We intend to
continuously expand our existing product offerings and introduce
new products, and expect that expenditures for these purposes
will increase in absolute dollars. For both fiscal 2003 and
2002, no software development costs were capitalized.

General and
administrative

— General and
administrative expenses decreased 8.4% to $36.8 million in
fiscal 2003, from $40.2 million in fiscal 2002. These
expenses represented 4.1% and 5.1% of total revenues for fiscal
2003 and 2002, respectively. Decreases in absolute dollars were
primarily due to cost control, reduction in discretionary
spending efforts, the successful collection of previously
accrued customer-specific bad debt allowances, partially offset
by expenses associated with initiatives to enhance and implement
an enterprise-wide ERP system. General and administrative
headcount increased to 283 in fiscal 2003 from 246 in fiscal
2002. We believe that our general and administrative expenses
will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal 2004 due to the
investment in our enterprise-wide ERP system and expanded
regulatory requirements.



Amortization of
Goodwill

— Due to the
adoption of SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized
in fiscal 2003 as compared to amortization expense of
$15.2 million in fiscal 2002.

Stock
compensation

— We account
for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance
with the provisions of APB No. 25,

“Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees,”

and comply with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123,

“Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,”

for non-employee
compensation awards. Accordingly, we recognize the intrinsic
value for employees and the fair value for non-employees as
stock compensation expense over the vesting terms of the awards.
Stock compensation expenses were $3.6 million and
$7.2 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. This
decrease was primarily due to $2.2 million of lower
deferred stock compensation amortization in fiscal 2003 compared
to fiscal 2002 attributed to forfeitures of unvested options
assumed in the WebManage acquisition; a decrease of
$2.1 million of stock compensation as 165,310 contingently
issuable milestone shares relating to Orca valued at
$3.0 million were released in fiscal 2002 as compared to
the release of 99,186 shares valued at $0.9 million in
fiscal 2003; offset by an increase of $0.7 million relating
to the fair value of options granted to a member of the Board of
Directors. Estimated future deferred stock compensation
amortization relating to assumed WebManage unvested options and
deferred salary investment options for fiscal 2004 are expected
to be $1.2 million. For fiscal 2005, estimated future stock
compensation amortization expenses are $0.2 million and
none thereafter.

Restructuring
charges

— In fiscal 2002, as
a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a
reduction in IT spending rates, we implemented two restructuring
plans, which included reductions in workforce and a
consolidation of facilities.

Fiscal 2002 Second Quarter Restructuring
    Plan

In August 2001, we implemented the first
restructuring plan, which included a reduction in workforce by
approximately 200 employees and a consolidation of
facilities. The action was required to properly align and manage
the business commensurate with our then current revenue levels.
All functional areas of the Company were affected by the
reduction. We completed our actions during the second quarter of
fiscal 2002. As a result of this restructuring, we incurred a
charge of $8.0 million. The restructuring charge included
$4.8 million of severance-related amounts,
$2.7 million of committed excess facilities and facility
closure expenses, and $0.5 million in fixed assets
write-offs. The reserve balances of $0.8 million and
$0.5 million, respectively, at April 30, 2003 and
2002, were included in other accrued liabilities.

During fiscal 2002, we purchased our Sunnyvale
headquarters site and terminated the operating leases. As a
result, an adjustment was made to reduce the previously recorded
estimated facilities lease losses by $1.5 million. During
fiscal 2003, we recorded a net restructuring adjustment of
$0.3 million due to changes in the estimated costs of
certain actions and final resolution of certain restructuring
activities. In the event that the foreign facilities are not
subleased, we will be obligated for additional total lease
payments of approximately $0.7 million to be payable
through January 2006.



The following analysis sets forth the significant
components of the restructuring reserve at April 30, 2003
and 2002 (in thousands):

Fiscal 2002 Fourth Quarter Restructuring
    Plan

In April 2002, we announced and substantially
completed a restructuring related to the closure of an
engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the
Sunnyvale headquarters, which included a headcount reduction of
34 employees. As a result of this restructuring, we
incurred a charge of $5.9 million. The restructuring charge
included $0.8 million of severance-related amounts,
$4.6 million of committed excess facilities and facility
closure expenses, and $0.5 million in fixed assets
write-off. Of the reserve balance at April 30, 2003,
$1.5 million was included in other accrued liabilities and
the remaining $3.1 million was classified as long-term
obligations.

In January 2003, we updated our assumptions and
estimates based on certain triggering events, which resulted in
an additional net charge of $0.9 million, primarily
relating to our engineering facility lease. Our estimates are
reviewed and revised periodically and may result in a
substantial charge to restructuring expense should different
conditions prevail than were anticipated in original management
estimates. Such estimates included various assumptions such as
the time period over which the facilities will be vacant,
expected sublease terms, and expected sublease rates. In the
event that the engineering facility is not subleased, we will be
obligated for additional total lease payments of
$3.4 million to be payable through November 2010.

The following analysis sets forth the significant
components of the restructuring reserve at April 30, 2003
and 2002 (in thousands):

Of the reserve balances at April 30, 2003
and 2002, $1.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively
were included in other accrued liabilities and the remaining
$3.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively, were
classified as long-term obligations.



Interest
income

— During fiscal 2003,
interest income was $12.2 million, as compared to
$18.5 million in fiscal 2002. The decrease in interest
income was primarily due to lower average interest rates,
partially offset by higher investment balances provided by
operating activities. We expect interest income to decline
further in fiscal 2004, as existing investments mature and
proceeds are reinvested in a lower interest-rate environment.

Other income (expense),
net

— Other income
(expense), net, included a net exchange loss from foreign
currency transactions of $1.0 million and
$1.8 million, respectively, for fiscal 2003 and 2002.

Net loss on
investments

— Our
investments in publicly held companies are generally considered
impaired when a decline in the fair value of an investment as
measured by quoted market prices is less than its carrying
value, and such a decline is not considered temporary. In fiscal
2003, we recorded a noncash, other-than-temporary write-down of
$0.7 million related to the impairment of our investment in
a publicly traded company. In fiscal 2002, we recorded a
noncash, other-than-temporary write-down of $13.0 million
related to impairments of our investments in publicly traded and
private companies. During fiscal 2003, we sold shares of certain
privately held investments and realized a net loss of
$0.5 million. During fiscal 2002, we sold shares of certain
marketable investments and the realized gain was not material.

Gain on sale of intangible
assets

— We recorded a gain
on sale of intangible assets of $0.6 million in fiscal 2003
related to the sale of our ContentReporter

TM

software. We intend to resell this software through a licensing
arrangement.

Provision (benefit), for income
taxes

— For fiscal 2003, our
effective tax rate was 21.8%. The effective tax rate for fiscal
2003 differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to
credits, and foreign earnings in a lower tax jurisdiction. For
fiscal 2002, we applied an annual benefit rate of 19.7% to
pretax loss. Our effective tax rate is based on existing tax
laws and distributions of income/(loss) among different entities
and tax jurisdictions.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001

Product
revenues

— Product revenues
decreased by 23.8% to $729.9 million in fiscal 2002, from
$957.8 million in fiscal 2001. The decline in product
revenues was due to a decrease in product sales to
Internet-based companies and reduced capital spending among
technology companies across all geographies, but primarily in
North America. This decrease in product revenues for fiscal 2002
was specifically attributable to a lower volume of units and
software licenses shipped, as compared to fiscal 2001.

Product revenues were negatively impacted by the
following factors:

Product revenues were favorably impacted by the
following factors:

•

increased sales from new industry verticals:
    energy, telecommunications, financial services, manufacturing,
    life sciences and the government;

•

a higher average selling price of our new
    products: our high-end F880 and low-end F87 filer products, as
    well as new NetCache appliances and software features;

•

competitive pricing advantage as a result of
    lower total cost of ownership in four aspects: lower acquisition
    cost, reduced administrative overhead, minimized service cost
    and reduced downtime of critical business applications;



Service
revenues

— Service revenues
increased by 41.6% to $68.5 million in fiscal 2002, from
$48.4 million in fiscal 2001. Service revenue is generally
deferred and, in most cases, recognized ratably over the service
period obligations, which are typically one to three years. The
increase in service revenues (representing 8.6% and 4.8% of
total revenues for fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively) was
primarily related to a growing installed base resulting in new
customer support contracts in addition to support contract
renewals by existing customers.

International total revenues (including U.S.
exports) decreased by 12.4% for fiscal 2002 as compared to
fiscal 2001. International total revenues were
$335.2 million, or 42.0% of total revenues for fiscal 2002.
The decline in international sales for fiscal 2002 was primarily
a result of a slower demand in the Europe and Asia Pacific
markets offset by our increased sales and marketing efforts
internationally.

Product gross
margin

— Product gross
margin decreased to 63.3% of product revenues for fiscal 2002 as
compared to 64.0% in fiscal 2001. Amortization of existing
technology included in cost of product revenue was $5.7 and
$2.6 million, respectively, for fiscal 2002 and 2001.

Product gross margin was negatively impacted by:

Product gross margin was favorably impacted by:

Service gross
margin

— Service gross
margin increased to 18.2% for fiscal 2002 as compared to a
negative gross margin of 23.8% in fiscal 2001. Investments in
customer service decreased by 6.5% to $56.0 million in
fiscal 2002, from $59.9 million in fiscal 2001. The
improvement in service gross margin in fiscal 2002 was primarily
due to operational and cost efficiencies in the global customer
service organizations. The negative



service gross margin in fiscal 2001 was due to
the ramping up and continued investment in our service
infrastructure in anticipation of service revenue growth.

Sales and
marketing

— Sales and
marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions,
advertising and promotional expenses, and certain customer
service and support costs. Sales and marketing expenses
decreased 1.6% to $284.4 million for fiscal 2002, from
$289.0 million for fiscal 2001. These expenses were 35.6%
and 28.7% of total revenues for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001,
respectively. The decrease in absolute dollars was attributed to
various cost control and reduction measures, restructuring
impact, lower commission expenses and other profit-dependent
payroll-related expenses, and disposal of certain capital assets
in fiscal 2001, partially offset by the continued worldwide
investment in our sales and customer service organizations.
Sales and marketing headcount decreased to 1,224 in fiscal 2002,
from 1,277 in fiscal 2001 due primarily to the restructuring
impact.

Research and
development

— Research and
development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits,
prototype expenses, non-recurring engineering charges, and fees
paid to outside consultants. Research and development expenses
decreased 3.5% to $116.7 million in fiscal 2002, from
$120.9 million in fiscal 2001. These expenses represented
14.6% and 12.0% of total revenues for fiscal 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Research and development expenses decreased in
absolute dollars, primarily as a result of cost control,
reduction in discretionary spending efforts, restructuring
impact, the two holiday facility shutdowns, lower headcount, and
lower profit-dependent payroll related expenses, partially
offset by the operating impact of the Orca and WebManage
acquisitions. Research and development headcount decreased to
514 in fiscal 2002, from 566 in fiscal 2001.

General and
administrative

— General and
administrative expenses decreased 0.1% to $40.2 million in
fiscal 2002, from $40.2 million in fiscal 2001. These
expenses represented 5.0% and 4.0% of total revenues for fiscal
2002 and 2001, respectively. Decreases in absolute dollars were
primarily due to cost controls, reductions in discretionary
spending, the impact of restructuring, the two holiday facility
shutdowns, and lower profit-dependent payroll related expenses,
partially offset by expenses associated with initiatives to
enhance enterprise-wide management information systems, general
legal costs, and an increase in the allowance for bad debts.
General and administrative headcount decreased to 246 in fiscal
2002, from 253 in fiscal 2001.

Amortization of
Goodwill

— Due to the
adoption of SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized
in fiscal 2003 as compared to amortization expense of
$15.2 million in fiscal 2002 and $9.1 million in
fiscal 2001.

In-process research and
development

— We incurred
in-process research and development charges of approximately
$26.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2001 related
to the acquisition of Orca. The purchase price of the
transaction was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities
based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the
acquisition. Approximately $26.7 million was allocated to
in-process research and development and charged to operations,
because the acquired technology had not reached technological
feasibility and had no alternative uses. The value was
determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired
in-process technology into commercially viable products,
estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects, and
discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The
discount rate included a factor that took into account the
uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the
acquired in-process technology. These estimates are subject to
change, given the uncertainties of the development process, and
no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates
will not occur.

The Orca acquisition has been successfully
utilized for the design and development of the DAFS protocol. By
eliminating much of the traditional operating system overhead,
DAFS allows for improved I/O performance while using fewer CPU
cycles. The protocol leverages next generation networking
technologies that provide remote memory transfer capabilities,
including Remote Direct Memory Access (“RDMA”)
implemented in Virtual Interface (“VI”) and
Infiniband. The DAFS protocol has good industry support and is
now under consideration as an industry standard. We introduced
DAFS capable products in April 2002.

Stock
compensation

— We account
for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance
with the provisions of APB No. 25,

“Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees,”

and comply with the



provisions of SFAS No. 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,”

for
non-employee compensation awards. Accordingly, we recognize the
intrinsic value for employees and the fair value for
non-employees as stock compensation expense over the vesting
terms of the awards. Stock compensation expenses were
$7.2 million and $6.2 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001,
respectively. This increase was primarily attributable to the
recognition of stock compensation on options assumed in the
WebManage acquisition and the release of 165,310 contingently
issuable milestone shares relating to Orca valued at
$3.0 million.

Restructuring
charges

— In August 2001, we
implemented a restructuring plan, which included a reduction in
workforce by approximately 200 employees and a
consolidation of facilities. The action was required to properly
align and manage the business commensurate with our then-current
revenue levels. All functional areas of the Company were
affected by the reduction. We completed our actions during the
second quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result of this
restructuring, we incurred a charge of $8.0 million. The
restructuring charge included $4.8 million of
severance-related amounts, $2.7 million of committed excess
facilities and facility closure expenses, and $0.5 million
in fixed assets write-offs.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we
purchased our Sunnyvale headquarters site and terminated the
operating leases. As a result, an adjustment was made to reduce
the previously recorded estimated facilities lease losses by
$1.5 million.

As of April 30, 2002, we had paid
substantially all of the severance liability. Of the balance at
April 30, 2002, $0.5 million was included in other
accrued liabilities.

The following analysis sets forth the significant
components of the second quarter fiscal 2002 restructuring at
April 30, 2002 (in thousands):

In April 2002, we announced and substantially
completed a restructuring related to the closure of an
engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the
Sunnyvale headquarters, which included a headcount reduction of
34 employees. As a result of this restructuring, we
incurred a charge of $5.9 million. The restructuring charge
included $0.8 million of severance-related amounts,
$4.6 million of committed excess facilities and facility
closure expenses, and $0.5 million in fixed assets
write-offs. Of the reserve balance at April 30, 2002,
$1.1 million was included in other accrued liabilities and
the remaining $3.6 million was classified as long-term
obligations.

The following analysis sets forth the significant
components of the fourth quarter fiscal 2002 restructuring at
April 30, 2002 (in thousands):

Interest income and other,
net

— During fiscal 2002,
interest income and other, net was $16.6 million, as
compared to $23.4 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease in
interest income was primarily due to lower average interest
rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances
from cash, short-term investments and



restricted cash generated from operations.
Interest income and other, net also included gains and losses
from foreign currency transactions.

Net loss on
investments

— We perform
periodic reviews of our investments for impairment. Our
investments in publicly held companies are generally considered
impaired when a decline in the fair value of an investment as
measured by quoted market prices is less than its carrying
value, and such a decline is not considered temporary. Our
investments in privately held companies are considered impaired
when a review of the investees’ operations and other
indicators of impairment indicate that the carrying value of the
investment is not likely to be recoverable. Such indicators
include, but are not limited to, limited capital resources,
limited prospects of receiving additional financing, and limited
prospects for liquidity of the related securities. In the second
quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded a noncash,
other-than-temporary write-down of $13.0 million related to
impairments of our investments in publicly traded and private
companies. During fiscal 2002 and 2001, we sold shares of
certain marketable equity securities and the realized gains for
those periods were not material.

Provision (benefit), for income
taxes

— For fiscal 2002, we
applied an annual benefit rate of 19.7% to pretax loss. For
fiscal 2001, our effective tax rate was 34.5%, which excluded
the effect of non-deductible amortization of goodwill and the
write-off of acquired in-process research and development. Our
effective tax rate is based on existing tax laws and
distributions of income/(loss) among different entities and tax
jurisdictions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of April 30, 2003, as compared to the
April 30, 2002 balances, our cash, cash equivalents, and
short-term investments increased by $164.7 million to
$618.8 million. We derive our liquidity and capital
resources primarily from our cash flow from operations and from
working capital. Working capital increased by
$124.9 million to $588.5 million as of April 30,
2003, compared to $463.6 million as of April 30, 2002.
We generated cash from operating activities totaling
$195.3 million and $143.9 million in fiscal 2003 and
2002, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities in
fiscal 2003 was principally related to net income of
$76.5 million, increases in other accrued liabilities,
accrued compensation and related benefits, income taxes payable,
deferred revenue, coupled with depreciation, net loss on
investments, amortization of intangible assets and stock
compensation, partially offset by decreased accounts payable,
and increases in accounts receivable, inventories, deferred
income taxes and prepaid expenses and other assets.

We used $61.3 million and
$284.2 million of cash in fiscal 2003 and 2002,
respectively, for capital expenditures. The fiscal 2002 property
and equipment expenditure included the purchase of the land and
buildings at our Sunnyvale headquarters site for
$249.8 million. Excluding the Sunnyvale headquarters land
and buildings acquisition, the increase in capital purchases
year over year was primarily attributed to upgrades of our ERP
infrastructure, computer-related purchases, and building
improvements. We used net proceeds of $90.0 million and
$149.9 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively, for
net purchases of short-term investments. Investing activities in
fiscal 2003 and 2002 also included new investments in
privately-held companies of $0.7 million and
$1.1 million, respectively. During fiscal 2003, we sold
certain privately held investments and received proceeds of
$0.8 million.

We received $29.2 million and
$230.2 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively, from
financing activities. The change in cash flow from financing in
fiscal 2002 included the effects of a decrease in restricted
cash requirements of $193.7 million. This requirement was
eliminated in April 2002 in conjunction with the purchase of our
Sunnyvale headquarters and termination of our operating leases,
and thus had no effect on cash flows from financing activities
in fiscal 2003. The decrease in cash flow from financing
activities was also a result of lower proceeds from stock option
exercises as a result of the decline in our stock price.

Our capital and liquidity requirements depend on
numerous factors, including risks relating to fluctuating
operating results, continued growth in the network storage and
content delivery markets, customer and market acceptance of our
products, dependence on new products, rapid technological
change, dependence on qualified technical and sales personnel,
risk inherent in our international operations, competition,
reliance on a limited number of suppliers and contract
manufacturers, relationships with strategic partners, dependence
on



proprietary technology, intellectual property
rights, the value of our investments in equity securities and
real estate, and other factors. We believe that our existing
liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to fund our
operations for at least the next twelve months.

Contractual Obligations

The following summarizes our contractual
obligations at April 30, 2003, and the effect such
obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow
in future periods, (in thousands):

Item 7a.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to
fluctuations in interest rates, market prices and foreign
currency exchange rates. We use certain derivative financial
instruments to manage these risks. We do not use derivative
financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All
financial instruments are used in accordance with
management-approved policies.

Market Interest and Interest Income
Risk

Interest and Investment
Income

— As of
April 30, 2003, we had short-term investments of
$334.7 million. Our investment portfolio primarily consists
of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the
date of purchase of greater than three months, which are
classified as available-for-sale, and investment in marketable
equity securities in primarily technology companies. These
highly liquid investments, consisting primarily of government
and corporate debt securities, are subject to interest rate and
interest income risk and will decrease in value if market
interest rates increase. A hypothetical 10% increase in market
interest rates from levels at April 30, 2003, would cause
the fair value of these short-term investments to decline by
approximately $0.7 million. Because we have the ability to
hold these investments until maturity we would not expect any
significant decline in value of our investments caused by market
interest rate changes. Declines in interest rates over time
will, however, reduce our interest income. We do not use
derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.

Market Price Risk

Equity
Securities

— We are also
exposed to market price risk on our equity securities included
in our short-term investments, which are primarily in publicly
traded companies in the volatile high-technology industry
sector. In fiscal 2003, we recorded a non-cash,
other-than-temporary write-down of $0.7 million related to
the impairment of our investment in a publicly traded company.
In fiscal 2002, we recorded a noncash, other-than-temporary
write-down of $13.0 million related to impairments in
publicly traded and private companies.

We do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our
market exposure on these securities and, as a result, the amount
of income and cash flow that we ultimately realize from our
investment in future periods may vary materially from the
current fair value. A 50% adverse change in the equity price
would result in an approximate $0.1 million decrease in the
fair value of our equity security as of April 30, 2003.

The hypothetical changes and assumptions
discussed above will be different from what actually occurs in
the future. Furthermore, such computations do not anticipate
actions that may be taken by management,



should the hypothetical market changes actually
occur over time. As a result, the effect on actual earnings in
the future will differ from those described above.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk and
Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts

We hedge risks associated with foreign currency
transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in
foreign currency exchange rates on earnings. We utilize forward
contracts to hedge against the short-term impact of foreign
currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies. All balance sheet hedges are
marked to market through earnings every period. We also use
foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency
forecasted transactions related to certain sales and operating
expenses. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges
under SFAS 133. For cash flow hedges, the gains or losses
were included in other comprehensive income and were not
material at April 30, 2003.

We do not enter into foreign exchange contracts
for speculative or trading purposes. In entering into forward
foreign exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might
arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the
terms of their contracts. We attempt to limit our exposure to
credit risk by executing foreign contracts with credit worthy
multinational commercial banks. All contracts have a maturity of
less than one year.

The following table provides information about
our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding on
April 30, 2003 (in thousands):

Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Stockholders of

Network Appliance, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Network Appliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries
(the “Company”) as of April 30, 2003 and 2002,
and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
April 30, 2003. Our audits also included the consolidated
financial statement schedule listed in Item 14(a)(2). These
financial statements and the financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
statements and the financial statement schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Network Appliance, Inc. and its
subsidiaries as of April 30, 2003 and 2002, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended April 30, 2003 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also, in our opinion, the consolidated financial
statement schedule listed in Item 14(a)(2), when considered
in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 13, effective May 1,
2002, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill
and other intangible assets to conform to Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142,

Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal
Year

— We operate on a
52-week or 53-week year ending on the last Friday in April. For
presentation purposes we have indicated in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements that our fiscal year end is
April 30. Fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 were 52-week fiscal
years.

Basis of
Presentation

— The
consolidated financial statements include the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts
from prior years have been reclassified to conform to
current-year presentation. These reclassifications did not
change previously reported total assets, liabilities,
stockholders’ equity or net income.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

— We consider
all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Short-Term
Investments

—
Available-for-sale investments with original maturities of
greater than three months are classified as short-term
investments, as these investments generally consist of highly
marketable securities that are intended to be available to meet
current cash requirements. All of our investments are classified
as available-for-sale, which are carried at fair market value,
and unrealized gains or losses recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive loss, which is a separate component of
stockholders’ equity, net of taxes. Any gains or losses on
sales of investments are computed based upon specific
identification. For all periods presented, realized gains and
losses on available-for-sale investments were not material.
Management determines the appropriate classification of debt and
equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the
classification at each reporting date. Available-for-sale
investments are reviewed for evidence of reductions in market
value that are other than temporary. We perform periodic reviews
of our investments for impairment. Our investments in publicly
held companies are generally considered impaired when a decline
in the fair value of an investment as measured by quoted market
prices is less than its carrying value and such a decline is not
considered temporary. During fiscal 2003 and 2002, we recorded a
noncash, other-than-temporary write-down of $726 and $3,641,
respectively, related to impairment of our investments in
publicly traded companies. These write-downs are included in net
loss on investments on the income statement. No write-downs were
recorded during fiscal 2001.

Investments in Nonpublic
Companies

— We have certain
investments in nonpublicly traded companies in which we have
less than 20% of the voting rights and in which we do not
exercise significant influence. As of April 30, 2003 and
2002, $909 and $1,724 of these investments are included in other
long-term assets on the balance sheet and are carried at cost.
We perform periodic reviews of our investments for impairment.
Our investments in privately held companies are considered
impaired when a review of the investees’ operations and
other indicators of impairment indicate that the carrying value
of the investment is not likely to be recoverable. Such
indicators include, but are not limited to, limited capital
resources, limited prospects of



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

receiving additional financing, and limited
prospects for liquidity of the related securities. During fiscal
2002, we recorded a noncash, other-than-temporary write-down of
$9,367 related to impairments of our investments in private
companies. No write-downs were recorded during fiscal 2003 and
2001. During fiscal 2003, we sold shares of certain privately
held investments and realized a net loss of $503.

Inventories

—
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out
basis) or market.

Property and
Equipment

— Property and
equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, which generally range from three to five years. The land
at the Sunnyvale headquarters site acquired in April 2002 is not
being depreciated. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the
remaining term of the lease. Building improvements are amortized
over the estimated lives of the assets, which generally range
from ten to forty years. Construction in progress will be
amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective
assets when they are ready for their intended use.

We review the carrying values of long-lived
assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net
book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected
future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition. The
amount of impairment loss, if any, is measured as the difference
between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the
asset.

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible
Assets

— Goodwill and
purchased intangible assets include goodwill and other
intangible assets such as existing workforce and existing
technology, which are carried at cost less accumulated
amortization. For business combinations consummated before
July 1, 2001, goodwill and existing workforce were
amortized through April 30, 2002 using the straight-line
method over an estimated useful life of three to five years.
Amortization of other purchased intangibles is computed using
the straight-line method over the expected useful life of three
to five years. We evaluate the impairment of goodwill and
purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. See Note 13 —

Goodwill and
Purchased Intangible Assets

.

Revenue Recognition and
Allowance

— We apply the
provisions of SOP 97-2,

“Software Revenue
Recognition,”

and related interpretations to all
revenue transactions. We recognize revenue when:

For arrangements with multiple elements, we
allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based
on vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered items.
We defer the portion of the arrangement fee equal to the fair
value of the undelivered elements until they are delivered.
Vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged
when the element is sold separately.



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

A typical arrangement includes product, software
subscription, and maintenance. Some arrangements include
training and consulting. Software subscriptions include
unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a
when-and-if-available basis, bug fixes, and patch releases, and
are included in product revenues. Service maintenance includes
contracts for technical support and hardware maintenance.
Revenue from software subscriptions and service is recognized
ratably over the contractual term, generally one to three years.
Revenue from training and consulting is recognized as the
services are performed.

The following table presents the components of
revenues, stated as a percentage of total revenues:

We record reductions to revenue for estimated
sales returns at the time of shipment. These estimates are based
on historical sales returns, changes in customer demand, and
other factors. If actual future returns and allowances differ
from past experience, additional allowances may be required.

We also maintain a separate allowance for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of our customers to make required payments. We analyze
accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer solvency, current economic and
geographic trends, and changes in customer payment terms and
practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for
doubtful accounts. If the financial condition of our customers
deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to
make payments, additional allowances may be required.

Software Development
Costs

— The costs for the
development of new software products and substantial
enhancements to existing software products are expensed as
incurred until technological feasibility has been established,
at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in
accordance with SFAS No. 86,

“Accounting for the
Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
Marketed.”

Because we believe our current process for
developing software is essentially completed concurrently with
the establishment of technological feasibility, which occurs
upon the completion of a working model, no costs have been
capitalized for any of the periods presented. In accordance with
SOP 98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use,”

the
cost of internally-developed software is capitalized and
included in property and equipment at the point at which the
conceptual formulation, design and testing of possible software
project alternatives have been completed and management
authorizes and commits to funding the project. Pilot projects
and projects where expected future economic benefits are less
than probable are not capitalized. Internally-developed software
costs include the cost of software tools and licenses used in
the development of our systems, as well as consulting costs.
Completed projects are transferred to property and equipment at
cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives, generally three years.

Foreign Currency
Translation

— For
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency,
gains and losses resulting from translation of these foreign
currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are
recorded within stockholders’ equity as part of accumulated
other comprehensive loss. For subsidiaries where the functional
currency is the U.S. dollar, gains and losses resulting
from the process of remeasuring foreign currency financial
statements into U.S. dollars are included in other income.



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In fiscal 2002, we determined that the functional
currency of one of our subsidiaries had changed from the Euro to
the U.S. Dollar. Accordingly, all monetary assets and
liabilities were translated at the current exchange rate in
effect as of the balance sheet date, nonmonetary assets and
liabilities were translated at historical rates, and total
revenues and expenses were translated at average exchange rates
in effect during the period. Transaction gains and losses are
included in other income (expense) in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.

Derivative
Instruments

— We adopted
SFAS 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities.”

Derivatives that are not
designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through
earnings. If the derivative is designated as a hedge, depending
on the nature of the exposure being hedged, changes in fair
value will either be offset against the change in fair value of
the hedged asset or liability through earnings, or recognized in
other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized
in earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedge is recognized
in earnings immediately. The adoption of this accounting
standard did not have a significant impact on our financial
position, results of operations, or cash flow.

As a result of our significant international
operations, we are subject to risks associated with fluctuating
exchange rates. We use derivative financial instruments,
principally currency forward contracts, to attempt to minimize
the impact of exchange rate movements on our balance sheet
relating to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and
operating results. We do not enter into derivative financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Currently, we
do not enter into any foreign exchange forward contracts to
hedge exposures related to firm commitments or equity
investments. Our major foreign currency exchange exposures and
related hedging programs are described below:

Balance Sheet. We utilize currency forward
contracts to hedge currency exchange rate fluctuations related
to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. Gains and
losses on these undesignated derivatives offset gains and losses
on the assets and liabilities being hedged and the net amount is
included in earnings. In fiscal 2003, net gains generated by
hedged assets and liabilities totaled $9,910, which were offset
by losses on the related derivative instruments of $10,932. In
fiscal 2002, net gains generated by hedged assets and
liabilities totaled $1,684, which were offset by losses on the
related derivative instruments of $3,485. In fiscal 2001, net
losses generated by hedged assets and liabilities totaled
$2,250, which were offset by gains on the related derivative
instruments of $3,898.

Forecasted transactions. We use currency forward
contracts to hedge exposures related to forecasted sales and
operating expenses denominated in Euros and British Pounds.
These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges when the
transactions are forecasted and in general closely match the
underlying forecasted transactions in duration. The contracts
are carried on the balance sheet at fair value and the effective
portion of the contracts’ gains and losses is recorded as
other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction
occurs.

If the underlying forecasted transactions do not
occur, or it becomes probable that they will not occur, the gain
or loss on the related cash flow hedge is recognized immediately
in other income. During fiscal 2003, we did not record any gains
or losses related to forecasted transactions that did not occur
or became improbable.

We measure the effectiveness of hedges of
forecasted transactions on at least a quarterly basis by
comparing the fair values of the designated currency forward
contracts with the fair values of the forecasted transactions.
No ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings during fiscal 2003.

Use of
Estimates

— The preparation
of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America requires management to establish
accounting policies which contain estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Concentration of Credit
Risk

— Financial instruments
which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk
consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments,
and accounts receivable. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments consist primarily of U.S. government agencies,
corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, cash accounts held at
various banks, and money market funds held at several financial
institutions. We sell our products primarily to large
organizations in different industries and geographies. Credit
risk is mitigated by our credit evaluation process and limited
payment terms. We do not require collateral or other security to
support accounts receivable. In addition, we maintain an
allowance for potential credit losses. In entering into forward
foreign exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might
arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the
terms of their contracts. The counterparties to these contracts
are major multinational commercial banks, and we do not expect
any losses as a result of counterparty defaults.

Comprehensive
Income

— Comprehensive
income is defined as the change in equity during a period from
non-owner sources. Comprehensive income for the years ending
April 30, 2003, 2002, and 2001 has been disclosed within
the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity and
comprehensive income.

The components of accumulated other comprehensive
loss at April 30, were as follows:

Net Income per
Share

— Basic net income per
share is computed by dividing income available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for that period. Diluted net income per share is
computed giving effect to all dilutive potential shares that
were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common
shares consist of incremental common shares subject to
repurchase and common shares issuable upon exercise of stock
options.



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following is a reconciliation of the
numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income
per share computations for the periods presented:

At April 30, 2003, 2002, and 2001, 44,582,
30,991, and 18,005 shares of common stock options with a
weighted average exercise price of $30.98, $40.17, and $59.45
respectively, were excluded from the diluted net income per
share computation, as their exercise prices were greater than
the average market price of the common shares for the periods.

Stock-Based
Compensation

— We account
for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions
of APB No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

, and comply with the disclosure provisions of
SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosures

. Deferred compensation recognized
under APB No. 25 is amortized to expense using the
graded vesting method. We account for stock options issued to
non-employees in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 123 and EITF No. 96-18 under the
fair value based method.

We adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
SFAS 123, and accordingly, no expense has been recognized
for options granted to employees under the various Plans. We
amortize deferred stock-based compensation on the graded vesting
method over the vesting periods of the applicable stock purchase
rights and stock options, generally four years. The graded
vesting method provides for vesting of portions of the overall
awards at interim dates and results in greater vesting in
earlier years than the straight-line method. Had compensation
expense been determined based on the fair value at the grant
date for awards, consistent with



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the provisions of SFAS 123, the
Company’s pro forma net loss and net loss per share would
be as follows (in thousands, except per share data):

During the preparation of the Company’s
fiscal 2003 consolidated financial statements, management
determined that the pro forma net loss and the pro forma net
loss per share for fiscal 2002 and 2001 (for purposes of
recording compensation for stock-based awards to employees under
SFAS 123 for disclosure purposes) did not include the
add-back of the APB 25 stock compensation expense and
accordingly such amounts have been reflected. These changes did
not impact the Company’s consolidated balance sheet,
consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of
stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income and
consolidated statements of cash flow for any of the periods
presented.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model, and is not subject to revaluation as a result of
subsequent stock price fluctuations. The following
weighted-average assumptions are used:

The Black-Scholes option pricing model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, option pricing models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
volatility. We use projected volatility rates, which are based
upon historical volatility rates since our initial public
offering, trended into future years. Because our employee stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those
of traded options and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management’s opinion, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value
of our options.



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

Statements of Cash Flows —

Supplemental cash flow and noncash
investing and financing activities are as follows:

Recently Issued Accounting
Standards —

In June 2002,
FASB issued SFAS No. 146,

“Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,”

which
addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs. SFAS
No. 146 supersedes previous accounting guidance,
principally EITF Issue No. 94-3. The Company adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 146 for restructuring activities
initiated after December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 146
requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred.
Under EITF Issue No. 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was
recognized at the date of the Company’s commitment to an
exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability
should initially be measured and recorded at fair value.
Accordingly, SFAS No. 146 may affect the timing of
recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts
recognized.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 45,

“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others”

(“FIN 45”).
FIN 45 requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair
value and requires a guarantor to make disclosures, even when
the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is
remote. For those guarantees and indemnifications that do not
fall within initial recognition and measurement requirements of
FIN 45, the Company must continue to monitor the conditions
that are subject to the guarantees and indemnifications, as
required under existing generally accepted accounting
principles, to identify if a loss has been incurred. If the
Company determines that it is probable that a loss has been
incurred, any such estimable loss would be recognized. The
initial recognition and measurement requirements do not apply to
the Company’s product warranties or to the provisions
contained in the majority of the Company’s software license
agreements that indemnify licensees of the Company’s
software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging
that the Company’s software infringes the intellectual
property rights of a third party. The Company has provided
disclosures for the year ended April 30, 2003 as required
by FIN 45 in Note 14 to its consolidated financial
statements. The Company does not expect adoption of the
liability recognition provisions to have a material impact on
its financial position or results of operations.

In December 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on
EITF 00-21,

“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables.”

This issue addresses certain aspects of
the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will
perform multiple revenue-generating activities. In some
arrangements, the different revenue-generating activities
(deliverables) are sufficiently separable and there exists
sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account
for some or all of the deliverables (that is, there are separate
units of accounting). In other arrangements, some or all of the
deliverables are not independently functional, or there is not
sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them
separately. This issue addresses when and, if



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

so, how an arrangement involving multiple
deliverables should be divided into separate units of
accounting. This issue does not change otherwise applicable
revenue recognition criteria. The guidance in this issue is
effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company does not
expect that the adoption of EITF 00-21 will have a material
effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure, an amendment to FASB Statement

.” SFAS 148 provides alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method
of accounting of stock-based employee compensation. In addition,
SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of
SFAS 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,”

to require prominent disclosures in both
annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect
of the method used on reported results. The Company adopted the
disclosure provisions of SFAS 148 effective April 30,
2003.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 46,

“Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities.”

FIN 46 requires an investor with a
majority of the variable interests in a variable interest entity
to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and
significant variable interest investors to provide certain
disclosures. A variable interest entity is an entity in which
the equity investors do not have a controlling interest or the
equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the
entity’s activities without receiving additional
subordinated financial support from the other parties. The
Company does not expect to identify any variable interest
entities that must be consolidated.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149,

“Amendment of SFAS No. 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.”

SFAS No. 149
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133.
In particular, this Statement clarifies under what circumstances
a contract with an initial net investment meets the
characteristic of a derivative. It also clarifies when a
derivative contains a financing component that warrants special
reporting in the statement of cash flows. SFAS No. 149 is
generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003 and is not expected to have an impact on the
Company upon adoption.

In May 2003, the FASB has issued SFAS
No. 150,

“Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity.”

The Statement improves the accounting for
certain financial instruments that, under previous guidance,
issuers could account for as equity. The new Statement requires
that those instruments be classified as liabilities in
statements of financial position. This statement is effective
for interim periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The
Company is currently evaluating the effect of this statement on
its consolidated financial statement. The Company does not
expect that the adoption of SFAS 150 will have a material effect
on its consolidated financial statements.

4.     Commitments
and Contingencies

In fiscal 2002, we terminated our operating lease
obligations for our Sunnyvale headquarters site by purchasing
the land and buildings for $249,840. As a result of headcount
reductions in fiscal 2002, we are not currently utilizing
certain existing spaces at our California headquarters site.
Additionally, we have also exited office spaces under
non-cancellable leases in other locations both in the
U.S. and Europe. If we are unable to successfully sublease
our vacated and unoccupied office space under operating leases,
our operating results may be adversely affected. See
“Note 12: Restructuring Charges.”

We lease other sales offices and research and
development facilities throughout the U.S. and
internationally. These sales offices are also leased under
operating leases which expire through fiscal 2019. We are
responsible for certain maintenance costs, taxes, and insurance
under these leases. The aggregate annual minimum rent commitment
under our operating leases is included in the minimum annual
lease payments schedule below.

Future minimum annual lease payments as of
April 30, 2003, are as follows:

Rent expense was $12,609, $18,150, and $18,090
for the years ended April 30, 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively. Rent expense under certain of our facility leases
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease. The difference between the amounts paid and the amounts
expensed is classified as long-term obligations in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In the past, we entered into agreements and
established Network Appliance accounts with Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown whereby we had the option to guarantee any defaults of
certain margin loans made to two corporate officers by the
financial institution on their Network Appliance stock. In the
past, we also entered into an agreement and established a
Network Appliance account with Goldman, Sachs and Co. whereby we



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

had the option to guarantee any default of a
certain margin loan made to a third corporate officer by the
financial institution on his Network Appliance stock. The amount
of the guarantee was limited to the excess, if any, of the
amount of such loans over the fair market value of the Network
Appliance stock securing the loans. As of August 26, 2002,
these accounts with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and Goldman, Sachs
and Co. were closed.

In May 2000, we entered into a split dollar
insurance arrangement with our CEO. Under the arrangement, we
will pay the annual premiums on several insurance policies on
the life of the survivor of our CEO and his wife, and our CEO
will reimburse us each year for a portion of those premiums
equal to the economic value of the term insurance coverage
provided him under the policies. For each of the 2001, 2002 and
2003 fiscal years, we paid an aggregate net annual premium on
these split dollar polices in the amount of $2,050. Under the
arrangement, we will be reimbursed for all premium payments made
on those policies, and it is intended that we will be reimbursed
not later than May 2005. Upon the death of both our CEO and his
wife or any earlier cash-out of the policies, we will be
entitled to a refund of all cumulative premiums paid on these
policies by us, and the balance will be paid to our CEO or his
designated beneficiaries. The arrangement is terminable by us
upon thirty (30)-days prior notice, and such termination will
trigger a refund of the net cumulative premiums paid by us on
the policies.

From time to time, we have committed to purchase
various key components used in the manufacture of our products.
Our loss accrual for such commitments to these key component
vendors is based on our current forecasts of inventory usage. We
establish accruals for estimated losses on purchased components
for which we believe it is probable that they will not be
utilized in future operations. To the extent that such forecasts
are not achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may
change.

We are subject to various legal proceedings and
claims which may arise in the normal course of business. We do
not believe that any current litigation or claims will have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or
financial condition.

5.     Line of
Credit

In July 1998, we negotiated a $5,000 unsecured
revolving credit facility with a domestic commercial bank. Under
terms of the credit facility, which expires in December 2003, we
must maintain various financial covenants. Any borrowings under
this agreement bear interest at either LIBOR plus 1% or at the
lender’s “prime” lending rate, such rate
determined at our discretion. As of April 30, 2003, the
amounts outstanding under this line of credit amounted to $1,194
relating to workers’ compensation and a foreign lease.

We also have foreign exchange facilities used for
hedging arrangements with several banks that allow us to enter
into foreign exchange contracts of up to $125,000, of which
$7,484 was available at April 30, 2003.

6.     Stockholders’
Equity

Preferred
Stock

— Our Board of
Directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000 shares of
preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences,
privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, of those
shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders.

Stock Option
Plans

— We adopted the 1993
Stock Option/ Stock Issuance Plan (the “1993 Plan”) in
April 1993. In September 1995, we adopted the 1995 Stock
Incentive Plan (the “1995 Plan”). The 1995 Plan
replaced the 1993 Plan and provides for the grant of options and
the issuance of common stock under terms substantially the same
as those provided under the 1993 Plan, except that the 1995 Plan
does not allow for the exercise of options prior to vesting.
Accordingly, all options and shares issued under the 1993 Plan
were incorporated into the 1995 Plan upon the effectiveness of
our initial public offering.



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Under the 1995 Plan, the Board of Directors may
grant to employees, directors and consultants options to
purchase shares of our common stock. The exercise price for an
incentive stock option and a nonqualified stock option cannot be
less than 100% and 85%, respectively, of the fair market value
of our common stock as determined by the Board of Directors on
the date of grant. Options granted under the 1995 Plan generally
vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting
commencement date and then ratably over the following
36 months. Options expire as determined by the Board of
Directors, but not more than ten years after the date of grant.

In April 1997, the Board of Directors adopted the
Special Non-officer Stock Option Plan (the “Non-officer
Plan”) which provides for the grant of options and the
issuance of common stock under terms substantially the same as
those provided under the 1995 Plan, except that the Non-officer
Plan allows only for the issuance of nonqualified options to
non-officer employees.

In August 1999, the Board of Directors adopted
the 1999 Stock Option Plan (the “1999 Plan”), which is
comprised of two separate equity incentive programs:
(i) the Discretionary Option Grant Program under which
options may be granted to eligible individuals during the
service period at a fixed price per share and (ii) the
Automatic Option Grant Program under which nonemployee board
members will automatically receive special option grants at
designated intervals over their period of board service.

The 1999 Plan will supplement the existing 1995
Plan and Non-officer Plan and those plans will continue to
remain in full force and effect until all available shares have
been issued under each such plan. However, the Automatic Option
Grant Program previously in effect under the 1995 Plan
terminated as of October 26, 1999, and all automatic option
grants made to nonemployee board members on or after that date
will be made under the 1999 Plan.

Under the 1999 Plan, the Board of Directors may
grant to employees, directors and consultants and other
independent advisors options to purchase shares of our common
stock during their period of service with us. The exercise price
for an incentive stock option and a nonstatutory option cannot
be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock
on the grant date. Options granted under the 1999 Plan generally
vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting
commencement date and then ratably over the following
36 months. Options will have a term of ten years after the
date of grant, subject to earlier termination upon the
occurrence of certain events. In fiscal 2003, the 1999 plan was
amended to increase the share reserve by an additional 14,000
shares of common stock and effect certain changes to the
Automatic Option Grant Program in effect for the nonemployee
members of the Board of Directors.

Options granted under the 1999 Plan are subject
to the cancellation/ regrant program with the following
limitations: (i) only options held by employees who are
neither executive officers nor members of the board can be
repriced; and (ii) the total number of repriced options
will not exceed 10% of the total number of shares of common
stock authorized for issuance under the 1999 Plan.

In fiscal 2001, we assumed various stock option
plans in connection with our Orca and WebManage acquisitions.
Pursuant to the provisions of the merger agreements, outstanding
shares were exchanged under certain exchange ratios in effect at
the time of each merger. Options granted under these plans
generally vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the
vesting commencement date and then ratably over the following
36 months. Options expire as determined by the Board of
Directors, but not more than ten years after the date of grant.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

— Under the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), employees are entitled
to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the fair market
value at certain specified dates. In fiscal 2003, the plan was
amended to increase the share reserve by an additional 2,400
shares of common stock. Of the 13,600 shares authorized to be
issued under this plan, 5,156 shares were available for issuance
at April 30, 2003, 1,414, 1,094, and 448 shares were issued
in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively, at a weighted
average price of $10.74, $14.60, and $27.96 respectively.

Deferred Stock
Compensation

— We recorded
$1,171, $1,301, and $14,127 of deferred compensation in fiscal
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, primarily related to the
recognition of stock compensation of unvested options assumed in
the WebManage acquisition, and the grant of stock options to
certain highly compensated employees. We reversed $1,612, $5,381
and $34 of deferred compensation in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively, due to employee terminations. The reversals were
primarily related to the forfeiture of unvested options assumed
in the WebManage acquisition as a result of employee
terminations.

Under terms of the 1995 Stock Option Plan, highly
compensated employees as defined by our management are eligible
to contribute between $15 and $75 in annual salary for the
rights to be granted nonqualified stock options. The discount
from fair market value, which is equal to the amount of salary
contributed, has been recorded as deferred stock compensation
expense. The deferred compensation expense is amortized ratably
over a one-year period.

Estimated future deferred stock compensation
amortization relating to assumed WebManage unvested options and
deferred salary investment options for fiscal 2004 are expected
to be $1,187. For fiscal 2005, estimated future stock
compensation amortization expenses are $176 and none thereafter.

Under terms of the acquisition agreement with
Orca, we released shares of common stock to former Orca
shareholders upon Orca’s meeting certain performance
criteria. The fair market values of these shares were measured
on the date the performance criteria were met and were
recognized as stock compensation. During fiscal 2003 and 2002,
we released an additional 99 and 165 shares of common stock,
respectively, valued in the aggregate at $921 and $3,015,
respectively. There are no additional performance milestones
remaining.

We recorded $748 in compensation expense in
fiscal 2003 for the fair value of options granted to a
member of the Board of Directors in recognition for services
performed outside of the normal capacity of a board member. The
100 common shares under the 1999 Plan were granted at an
exercise price of $15.72 per share, the fair market value per
share on the grant date. The option has a term of 10 years
measured from the grant date, subject to earlier termination
following his cessation of board service, and will vest in a
series of 48 successive equal monthly installments upon his
completion of each month of board service over the 48 month
period measured from the grant date.

In fiscal 2003, we reached a final settlement of
the escrow fund arrangement under the WebManage acquisition
agreement. We have determined the total amount of our losses
under the settlement arrangement and 11 restricted shares were
released from the escrow and delivered to Network Appliance,
valued in the aggregate at $1,210 based on the fair market value
of our common stock as of the date of the acquisition.
Accordingly, an adjustment was made to the cost of the WebManage
acquisition. The balance of the escrow shares has been
distributed to former shareholders of WebManage in proportion to
their share ownership in WebManage, as provided in the original
merger agreement.

In fiscal 2001, under terms of the acquisition
agreement with WebManage, we issued an additional 101 shares of
common stock to former WebManage stockholders upon
WebManage’s meeting certain performance criteria. The fair
market value of the shares of $3,000 was measured on the date
the performance criteria were met and was recognized as stock
compensation.

Income Taxes

Income before income taxes is as follows:

The provision for income taxes consists of the

The provision for income taxes differs from the
amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax

The income tax benefits associated with
disposition from employee stock transactions of $18,458, $4,952,

recognized as additional paid in capital.



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The components of our deferred tax assets and
liabilities are as follows:

Current net deferred tax assets are $27,444 and
$32,529 as of fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. Non-current
net deferred tax assets for fiscal 2003 and 2002 are $40,631 and
$16,383 respectively, and are included in other assets within
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

As of fiscal 2003, the federal and state net
operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were
approximately $771,661 and $151,454, respectively. The federal
net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal
2011, and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin
to expire in fiscal 2006. As of fiscal 2003, we had federal and
state credit carryforwards of approximately $36,380 and $32,112,
respectively, available to offset future taxable income. These
federal and state credit carryforwards will begin to expire in
fiscal 2009.

We have provided a valuation allowance on certain
of our deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding
their realizability due to expectation of future employee stock
option exercises. Deferred tax assets of approximately $336,037
and $367,613 at the end of fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively,
pertain to certain tax credits and net operating loss
carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock
options. If recognized, the tax benefit of these credits and
losses will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders’
equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision.

willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
Because SFAS 107 excludes certain financial instruments and

We do not use derivative financial instruments
for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into forward
foreign exchange contracts to hedge trade and intercompany
receivables and payables as well as future sales and operating
expenses against future movement in foreign exchange rates.

The forward foreign exchange contracts require us
to exchange foreign currencies for U.S. dollars or vice versa
and generally mature in less than one year. As of April 30,
2003, we had $117,468 of outstanding foreign exchange contracts
in Australian Dollars, British Pounds, Swiss Francs, Canadian
Dollars and European Currency Units, that had remaining
maturities of five months or less. For the balance sheet hedges,
these contracts are adjusted to fair value at the end of each
month and are included in other income (expense), net. For the
cash flow hedges, the related gains or losses are included in
other comprehensive income. As of April 30, 2002, we had
$90,459 of outstanding foreign exchange contracts in Australian
Dollars, British Pounds, Swiss Francs and European Currency
Units, that had remaining maturities of one month or less. These
foreign exchange contracts are adjusted to the fair value at the
end of every month and are included in other income (expense),
net. Gains and losses on these foreign exchange contracts are
offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and
liabilities. At April 30, 2003 and 2002, the estimated fair
values of forward foreign exchange contracts were $117,516 and
$90,603, respectively. Unrealized gains or losses on foreign
exchange contracts were not significant at April 30, 2003.
The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is based on
prevailing financial market information. Other than foreign
exchange contracts, we have not entered into any other material
financial derivative instruments.

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments and restricted cash reported in the
consolidated balance sheets approximate their carrying value.
The fair value of short-term investments and foreign exchange
contracts is based on quoted market prices. Other investments in
equity securities comprise investments in companies in the
volatile high-technology market.

Employee Benefit Plan

We have established a 401(k) tax-deferred savings
plan (“Savings Plan”). Employees meeting the
eligibility requirements, as defined, may contribute specified
percentages of their salaries. We contributed $1,315, $1,235 and
$1,109 for fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

11. Acquisitions

In June 2000, we completed the acquisition of
Orca, a Waltham, Massachusetts-based developer of high
performance Virtual Interface (VI) Architecture software
for enterprise-class UNIX and Windows systems. The acquisition
fits with our strategy of developing highly available and
reliable intelligent storage solutions that improve the
performance of today’s Internet and enterprise applications
and strengthen our ability to develop next generation storage
networking architectures and protocols. The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase. Under terms of the agreement, we
acquired Orca for $50,037 in common stock, assumed options and
cash, with an obligation to provide 264 shares of common stock,
which will result in additional stock compensation charges if
certain performance criteria are achieved. Orca met certain
performance criteria and as such, we issued and recorded during
fiscal 2003 and 2002 an additional 99 and 165 shares of common
stock. The fair market value of such shares of $921 and $3,015,
respectively, was measured on the date Orca met the performance
criteria and was recognized as stock compensation in fiscal 2003
and 2002. There are no additional performance milestones
remaining. We also paid certain transaction costs and assumed
certain operating assets and liabilities.

The purchase price of the transaction was
allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their
estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition.
Approximately $26,688 was allocated to in-process research and
development and charged to operations because the acquired
technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative uses. The value was determined by estimating the
costs to develop the acquired in-process technology into
commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

cash flows from such projects, and discounting
the net cash flows back to their present value. The discount
rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty
surrounding the successful development of the acquired
in-process technology. These estimates are subject to change,
given the uncertainties of the development process, and no
assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will
not occur. Costs incurred prior to establishment of
technological feasibility are charged to research and
development expense and have not been material through
April 30, 2003. The Orca acquisition has been successfully
utilized for the design and development of the DAFS protocol. By
eliminating much of the traditional operating system overhead,
DAFS allows for improved I/ O performance while using fewer CPU
cycles. The protocol leverages next generation networking
technologies that provide remote memory transfer capabilities,
including RDMA implemented in VI and Infiniband. The DAFS
protocol has good industry support and is now under
consideration as an industry standard. We introduced DAFS
capable product in April 2002.

In November 2000, we completed the acquisition of
WebManage, a Chelmsford, Massachusetts-based software developer
of content management, distribution, and analysis solutions.
WebManage develops software that intelligently distributes
content between various points on the Internet and enables
organizations to plan, manage and deliver Internet/intranet
services. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. Under
terms of the agreement, we acquired WebManage for $59,371 in
common stock, assumed options, and cash. We also had an
obligation to provide shares of common stock to be valued at
$3,000 if WebManage achieved certain performance criteria.
WebManage met these performance criteria in March 2001 and as
such, the contingent consideration was recorded as stock
compensation in the fourth quarter of 2001. We also paid certain
transaction costs and assumed certain operating assets and
liabilities.

In fiscal 2003, we reached a final settlement of
the escrow fund arrangement under the WebManage acquisition
agreement. We have determined the total amount of our losses
under the settlement arrangement and 11 restricted shares were
released from the escrow and delivered to Network Appliance,
valued in the aggregate at $1,210 based on the fair market value
of our common stock as of the date of the acquisition.
Accordingly, an adjustment was made to the cost of the WebManage
acquisition. The balance of the escrow shares has been
distributed to former shareholders of WebManage in proportion to
their share ownership in WebManage, as provided in the original
merger agreement.

compensation, which aggregated to $12,304, is recorded as a
separate component of stockholders’ equity in the
accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet and will be
amortized over the vesting term of the related options.

The operating results of Orca and WebManage have

operations since the respective acquisition dates. The following
unaudited pro forma consolidated amounts give effect to these
acquisitions as if they had occurred on April 30, 2000 by

development has been excluded from the pro-forma results, as it
is a material nonrecurring charge.

12.     Restructuring
Charges

Fiscal 2002 Second Quarter Restructuring
    Plan

In August 2001, we implemented a restructuring
plan, which included a reduction in workforce by approximately
200 employees and a consolidation of facilities. The action was
required to properly align and manage the business commensurate
with our then current revenue levels. All functional areas of
the Company were affected by the reduction. We completed our
actions during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result of
this restructuring, we incurred a charge of $7,980. The
restructuring charge included $4,796 of severance-related
amounts, $2,656 of committed excess facilities and facility
closure expenses, and $528 in fixed assets write-offs. The
reserve balance of $807 at April 30, 2003 was included in
other accrued liabilities.

During fiscal 2002, we purchased our Sunnyvale
headquarters site and terminated the operating leases. As a
result, an adjustment was made to reduce the previously recorded
estimated facilities lease losses by $1,509. During fiscal 2003,
we recorded a net restructuring adjustment of $334 due to
changes in the estimated costs of certain actions and final
resolution of certain restructuring activities. In the event
that the foreign facilities are not subleased, we will be
obligated for additional total lease payments of approximately
$659 to be payable through January 2006.



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following analysis sets forth the significant
components of the restructuring reserve at April 30, 2003
and 2002:

Fiscal 2002 Fourth Quarter Restructuring
    Plan

In April 2002, we announced and substantially
completed a restructuring related to the closure of an
engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the
Sunnyvale headquarters, which included a headcount reduction of
34 employees. As a result of this restructuring, we
incurred a charge of $5,850. The restructuring charge included
$813 of severance-related amounts, $4,564 of committed excess
facilities and facility closure expenses, and $473 in fixed
assets write-off. Of the reserve balance at April 30, 2003,
$1,485 was included in other accrued liabilities and the
remaining $3,086 was classified as long-term obligations.

In January 2003, we updated our assumptions and
estimates based on certain triggering events, which resulted in
an additional net charge of $923, primarily relating to our
engineering facility lease. Our estimates are reviewed and
revised periodically and may result in a substantial charge to
restructuring expense, should different conditions prevail than
were anticipated in original management estimates. Such
estimates included various assumptions such as the time period
over which the facilities will be vacant, expected sublease
terms, and expected sublease rates. In the event that the
engineering facility is not subleased, we will be obligated for
additional total lease payments of $3,385 to be payable through
November 2010.

The following analysis sets forth the significant
components of the restructuring reserve at April 30, 2003
and 2002:



NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Of the reserve balances at April 30, 2003
and 2002, $1,485 and $1,061, respectively, were included in
other accrued liabilities and the remaining $3,086 and $3,655,
respectively, were classified as long-term obligations.

13.     Goodwill and
Purchased Intangible Assets

We adopted SFAS No. 142

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”

effective May 1, 2002. Upon adoption of
SFAS No. 142, we discontinued the amortization of our
recorded goodwill of $49,422 as of that date, identified our
reporting units based on our current segment reporting structure
and allocated all recorded goodwill, as well as other assets and
liabilities, to the reporting units. We concluded that our
reporting units are the same as our operating segments. Under
SFAS No. 142, goodwill attributable to each of our
reporting units is required to be tested for impairment by
comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its
carrying value. As of May 1, 2002, this evaluation
indicated that the fair value for each of our reporting units
exceeded the reporting unit’s carrying amount and no
impairment was recognized. On an ongoing basis, goodwill is
reviewed annually for impairment (or more frequently if
indicators of impairment arise). As of April 30, 2003,
there had been no impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.
There can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not
result in a charge to earnings.

In connection with the adoption of
SFAS No. 142, we also reassessed the useful lives and
the classification of our purchased intangible assets and
determined that they continued to be appropriate except for
acquired workforce net of deferred tax liabilities of $502,
which was reclassified into goodwill.

A reconciliation of our previously reported net
income and net income per share to amounts for the exclusion of
goodwill amortization net of the related income tax effect
follows:

Intangible assets balances are summarized as
follows:

Existing technology is amortized over three years
and total amortization expense for existing technology was
$5,478, $5,726 and $2,625 in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively and such amounts were included in cost of product
revenue. For fiscal 2004, estimated future amortization expense
is $2,954 and none thereafter.

14.     Guarantees

As of April 30, 2003, our financial
guarantees consisted of standby letters of credit outstanding,
bank guarantee, and restricted cash, which were related to
facility lease requirements, product performance guarantees,
customs and duties guarantees, VAT requirements, and
workers’ compensation plans. The maximum amount of
potential future payments under these arrangements was $2,630 as
of April 30, 2003. Of this maximum exposure, $1,142 of
restricted cash was classified under Other Assets on our balance
sheet at April 30, 2003. We have not recorded any liability
at April 30, 2003 related to these guarantees.

We provide both recourse and non-recourse lease
financing options to our customers. Under the terms of recourse
leases, which are generally 3 years or less, we remain
liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments. We
defer 100% of the recourse lease obligation and recognize
revenue over the term of the lease as the lease payments become
due. As of April 30, 2003 the maximum recourse exposure
totaled approximately $4,940. Under the terms of the
non-recourse leases, we do not have any continuing obligations
or liabilities. To date, we have not experienced significant
losses under this lease financing program.

We do not maintain a general warranty reserve for
estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is
recognized due to our extensive product quality program and
processes and because our customer service inventories utilized
to correct product failures are carried at zero cost.

We defend and indemnify our customers for damages
and reasonable costs incurred in any suit or claim brought
against them alleging that our products sold to our customers
infringe any U.S. patent, copyright, trade secret or
similar right. If a product becomes the subject of an
infringement claim, we may, at our option: (i) replace the
product with another non-infringing product that provides
substantially similar performance; (ii) modify the
infringing product so that it no longer infringes but remains
functionally equivalent; (iii) obtain the right for the
customer to continue using the product at our expense and for
the reseller to continue selling the product; (iv) take
back the infringing product and refund to customer the purchase
price paid less depreciation amortized on a straight line basis.
We have not been required to make material payments pursuant to
these provisions historically. We have not identified any losses
that are probable under these provisions and, accordingly, we
have not recorded a liability related to these indemnification
provisions.

15.     Subsequent
Events

On May 13, 2003, we announced that the Board
of Directors has approved a $150,000 stock repurchase program to
purchase shares of our outstanding common stock. The duration of
the repurchase program is open-ended. Under the program, Network
Appliance, Inc. could purchase shares of common stock through
open market transactions at prices deemed appropriate by
management. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions
under this program will depend on market conditions and
corporate and regulatory considerations. The purchases will be
funded from available working capital. The stock repurchase
program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

Controls and
    Procedures

Disclosure Controls are procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report, is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure Controls are also
designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Based on their evaluation, as of a date within
90 days of the filing of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have concluded the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934) are effective. There have been no significant changes in
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly
affect those controls subsequent to the date of their
evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. However, in
May 2003, we implemented new enterprise-wide software, as well
as new business processes and procedures to support the
software. These changes are the result of our normal business
process to evaluate and upgrade or replace our systems software
and related business processes to support our evolving
operational needs. The new software and processes will be used
to record and report our financial results for fiscal 2004.
