Customer
    Challenges

Network
    Appliance

tm

enterprise data management solutions address several major
    information technology (“IT”) challenges that plague
    today’s corporations.

•

Explosive data growth.

Managing the continued
    growth in data volume is one of the most critical challenges
    enterprises face today. By some estimates, the amount of data
    corporations are required to keep is doubling annually. Network
    Appliance specializes in storage consolidation solutions that
    allow customers to manage this explosive growth, while lowering
    their costs. Centralized management of pooled storage capability
    frees up valuable infrastructure and staff resources to improve
    enterprise productivity, performance, and profitability.

•

Doing more with less.

Many of the costs that
    drive up the total cost of data management are associated with
    such data center operations as data backup and recovery,
    hardware and software upgrade and maintenance arrangements,
    performance management, and resource allocation. By providing
    solutions based on a common architectural platform, along with
    the ability to flexibly and dynamically reprovision storage
    resources in real time, Network Appliance delivers solutions
    with unmatched efficiency and utilization. This means that our
    customers can do more while buying less.

•

Scaling the infrastructure.

As enterprises
    grow, customers are challenged to quickly adapt their
    infrastructures to meet corporate needs. A flexible, scalable,
    unified storage platform allows Network Appliance to deliver
    systems that economically accommodate growth

and

dramatically reduce the administrative overhead associated with
    provisioning and configuration changes. Today’s
    corporations must also provide timely information to offices
    around the globe. NetApp solutions help enterprises increase
    data access throughout their organizations by quickly
    replicating and relaying information between many locations
    while fully protecting the data.

•

Around-the-clock access.

All companies need to
    avoid costly downtime whether a result of planned maintenance, a
    localized disruption, or catastrophic disaster. In today’s
    information-driven world, every second of downtime is costly and
    hours of downtime can be catastrophic. Working in tandem with
    existing network infrastructures, NetApp storage appliances and
    data management software enable customers to implement fast,
    robust replication and recovery solutions within the bounds of
    their IT budgets.

•

Regulatory compliance.

Regulatory compliance
    is a growing concern for every industry on a global basis.
    NetApp offers compliance and security solutions that reduce
    business risk by addressing government and industry regulations
    while satisfying the need for data permanence, security, and
    confidentiality. By utilizing open industry-standard solutions
    and

best-in-class

partners, NetApp regulatory compliance solutions improve access
    to information transparently and seamlessly.

•

Electronic data discovery.

Electronic
    discovery (or

e-discovery)

is a standard requirement for today’s litigation process.
    NetApp information management solutions enable data discovery to
    mitigate litigation and compliance risks and to facilitate
    informed decision making. Our industry-leading information
    classification and management capabilities give organizations
    unmatched visibility and control of unstructured data across the
    enterprise.

•

Security of corporate and personal data.

With
    increasing amounts of personal customer data, companies assume
    great potential risk for their customers, their businesses, and
    their reputations. NetApp data encryption appliances provide the
    highest level of security available and can be seamlessly added
    to existing data infrastructures as required.

    helps improve enterprise productivity, performance, and
    profitability, while providing investment protection and
    enhanced asset utilization. NetApp enterprise-class storage
    solutions are interoperable across all platforms and supported
    by our service expertise.

Data
    ONTAP and Key Core Systems Software

NetApp FAS and V-Series storage solutions are all based on Data
    ONTAP, a highly optimized, scalable, and flexible operating
    system that uniquely supports any mix of SAN, NAS, and IP SAN
    (“iSCSI”) environments concurrently. Data ONTAP
    software integrates seamlessly into UNIX, Windows, and Web
    environments. The Data ONTAP operating system provides the
    foundation to build storage infrastructure and an
    enterprise-wide data fabric for mission-critical business
    applications, while lowering the TCO and complexity typically
    associated with the management of large-scale enterprise storage
    infrastructures.

Data ONTAP includes the patented NetApp
    WAFL

®

(Write Anywhere File Layout) file management system and the
    resiliency offered by
    RAID-DP

tm

(RAID Double Parity), a unique double-parity software RAID
    architecture. Data ONTAP supports all of the major
    industry-standard protocols’ storage, as well as our
    complete suite of data management, data replication, and data
    protection software products.

The Data ONTAP operating system includes two standard features,
    FlexVol

tm

and
    FlexShare

tm

,
    which improve the effectiveness of consolidation. FlexVol
    creates volumes that can be readily expanded or contracted while
    reducing the need for spare capacity. FlexShare enables the
    consolidation and prioritization of disparate workloads by
    ensuring that critical workloads get fast response.

The operating system also includes integrated secure access
    capabilities and
    FilerView

®

,
    a Web-based element manager. Snapshot technology, included as
    part of the base system, enables 256 virtual online backups and
    provides rapid access to previous versions of data, without
    requiring complete separate copies. Snapshot technology also
    eliminates the need to recover data from a tape archive in the
    event of a disaster or user error. In addition,
    SecureShare

®

is a multiprotocol lock management facility that is integrated
    into the Data ONTAP microkernel. The cross-protocol locking
    mechanism in SecureShare ensures heterogeneous data sharing
    without compromising security, data integrity, or performance.

Data ONTAP GX is our high-performance operating system, to
    support fully integrated, multinode systems. Data ONTAP GX
    systems are optimized to meet the extreme performance
    requirements of high-performance computing applications running
    on large
    Linux

®

and UNIX clusters, while delivering unmatched management
    simplicity and reliability. With Data ONTAP GX, multiple NetApp
    storage systems can be managed as a single entity under a global
    namespace. This enables all members of an application server
    cluster to access data stored across all of the FAS systems by
    using a single access point, eliminating the traditional
    complexities of mapping application servers to storage systems.
    This scale-out architecture is capable of achieving higher
    levels of aggregate system performance, because data volumes can
    span multiple storage nodes. Additionally, Data ONTAP GX
    provides the ability to dynamically add storage resources and
    transparently redistribute data without any disruption to client
    systems. The result is a storage system that combines the
    advantages of management simplicity with scalable performance
    and capacity. NetApp is in the process of merging the features
    of Data ONTAP 7G with Data ONTAP GX.

Data
    Management Software

Network Appliance products are in use today in some of the
    largest data centers in the world. These environments require
    enterprise-class management tools. NetApp provides key
    management tools to increase productivity and simplify data
    management. Such tools include FlexVol,
    FlexClone

®

,
    FlexShare

tm

,
    FlexCache and
    MultiStore

®

.



FlexVol

FlexVol technology, included in the Data ONTAP operating system,
    enables more efficient storage architectures with flexible
    volumes that do not require repartitioning of physical storage
    space. The FlexVol technology delivers storage virtualization
    solutions that can lower overhead and capital expenses, reduce
    disruption and risk, and provide the flexibility to adapt
    quickly and easily to the dynamic needs of the enterprise.
    FlexVol technology provisions storage resources automatically
    and enables the creation of multiple flexible volumes on a large
    pool of disks. This flexibility helps organizations maximize
    storage utilization and efficiency, simplify operations, and
    make changes quickly and seamlessly without downtime.

FlexClone

NetApp FlexClone technology enables true data cloning, or the
    instant replication of data volumes and data sets without
    requiring additional storage space at the time of creation. Each
    cloned volume is a transparent, virtual copy that can be used
    for essential enterprise operations, such as testing and bug
    fixing, platform and upgrade checks, multiple simulations
    against large data sets, remote office testing and staging, and
    market-specific product variations. Only data that has changed
    uses actual disk space. FlexClone provides substantial space
    savings with minimal overhead. Customers can manage many more
    data set variations in less time and with less risk to
    production environments.

FlexShare

FlexShare, introduced in fiscal year 2007 and included in Data
    ONTAP, directs the way storage system resources are used to
    deliver an appropriate level of service for each application.
    With FlexShare, you can host multiple workloads on a single
    NetApp system and assign individual priorities to each.
    FlexShare gives storage administrators the ability to leverage
    existing infrastructure and increase processing utilization
    without sacrificing the performance allocated to
    business-critical tasks. Using FlexShare, administrators can
    confidently consolidate disparate applications, prioritize
    specific data sets, and dynamically adjust priorities if
    business needs change.

FlexCache

FlexCache technology allows the creation of read-writeable
    replicas of volumes by creating caching volumes on multiple
    storage controllers. FlexCache technology is used by top
    enterprise customers in compute farm environments to scale
    Network File System (“NFS”) read I/O operations per
    second by surrounding volumes with multiple storage controllers.
    FlexCache technology is also used in distributed environments to
    improve user productivity by providing locally cached access to
    remote volumes over NFS.

MultiStore

NetApp MultiStore software lets you quickly and easily create
    completely separate logical partitions in storage systems and
    network storage resources. Each virtual storage partition
    maintains absolute separation from every other storage
    partition. The result is that different enterprise departments
    sharing the same storage resources cannot access or in any way
    find other partitions. MultiStore assures that no information on
    any virtual partition can be viewed, used, or downloaded by
    unauthorized users.

Fabric-Attached
    Storage (“FAS”) Family

The NetApp family of modular, scalable, highly available,
    unified networked storage systems provides seamless access to a
    full range of enterprise data for users on a variety of
    platforms. The FAS6000, FAS900, FAS3000, and FAS200 series of
    fabric-attached storage enterprise systems are designed to
    consolidate
    UNIX

®

,
    Windows

®

,
    network-attached storage (“NAS”), Fibre Channel
    (“FC”), Internet Small Computer Systems Interface
    (“iSCSI”), storage area network (“SAN”), and
    Web data in central locations running over the standard
    connection types: Gigabit Ethernet (“GbE”), Fibre
    Channel, and parallel SCSI (for backup). The NetApp design
    optimizes and consolidates high-performance data access for
    individuals in multiuser environments as well as for application



servers and server clusters with dedicated access. All FAS
    systems run the highly efficient Data
    ONTAP

®

microkernel operating system.

Data
    Protection Platform Products

In recent years, enterprises have centralized terabytes of data
    into networked storage environments to achieve lower costs,
    higher utilization, and simplified management. However,
    geopolitical events such as September 11, 2001; natural
    disasters such as the Hurricane Katrina disaster; government
    regulations such as Securities and Exchange Commission’s
    (“SEC”)

Rule 17a-4;

banking regulations such as Basel II; increased privacy concerns
    such as thefts of laptops with sensitive data; and industry
    guidelines such as PCI (Payment Card Industry standard put forth
    by Visa and MasterCard) have all put a spotlight on the need to
    protect and retain data for both the public and private sectors.
    Consolidation, coupled with a higher probability of disasters,
    has created a heightened sensitivity to the impact of data loss
    and its disruptive impact on the business. At the same time,
    compliance and privacy concerns are requiring enterprises to
    retain data for long periods of time, as well as to secure data
    at rest.

Data protection and retention have become critical IT
    priorities, requiring cost-effective storage solutions that can
    help the enterprise protect itself from catastrophic business
    disruption at an affordable cost. NetApp offers a comprehensive
    set of hardware and software solutions, including cost-effective
    SATA-based storage with built-in data reduction capabilities,
    disk-to-disk backup solutions, a family of replication and
    business continuance solutions, compliance and security
    solutions, and tools to manage this information ecosystem.

Data
    Retention and Archive Software Products

To meet growing regulatory compliance demands faced by most
    enterprises, Network Appliance offers a comprehensive suite of
    products to ensure data permanence, accessibility, and privacy
    across the variety of different regulations such as the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 21 CFR Part 11, SEC

Rule 17a-4,

and HIPAA. Immutable, cost-effective, resilient, and reliable
    storage architectures can be created utilizing the
    SnapLock

®

products in conjunction with NetApp NearStore platforms. The
    Information Server 1200 products provide advanced capabilities
    for both the initial classification and subsequent

e-discovery

requirements. Our
    DataFort

®

product adds security and privacy by encrypting data,
    while still allowing the capability to search the compliant data
    for legal discovery purposes if the need arises.



A significant demand is being created for disk-based digital
    content storage in applications such as medical images
    (“PACS”), video surveillance, interactive voice
    records, and Web multimedia content. The NetApp NearStore
    storage platforms offer highly scalable, cost-effective
    platforms for these applications. The NetApp platforms, based on
    open standards-based protocols, are easily integrated into the
    embedded solution vendor’s (“ESV”) overall
    solution for these applications. Search, indexing, and
    classification capabilities of the Information Server 1200
    product provide an easy way to access the relevant content in
    these massive data repositories, as well as meet the electronic
    discovery needs for our customers.

NearStore

The NetApp NearStore family of products represents SATA-based
    storage platforms optimized for data protection and retention
    applications. The NetApp NearStore system bridges the gap
    between primary storage and offline storage by providing much
    faster data access than offline storage at a cost much lower
    than primary storage. This makes NearStore ideal for data
    protection and retention applications such as disk-to-disk
    backup, business continuance, archival, compliant retention, and
    digital content storage.

The NearStore family consists of the R200 platform, the
    NearStore Virtual Tape Library (“VTL”) platforms, and
    the FAS platforms with SATA drives and NearStore personality
    licenses. The R200 is a SATA-only platform based on Data ONTAP
    and is available in capacities up to 168TB. The NearStore VTL is
    a disk-to-disk backup appliance that appears like a tape library
    to a backup software application but provides the superior speed
    and reliability of disk technologies for any heterogeneous
    primary storage environment. NetApp has also expanded the
    capabilities of its entire FAS platform line for near-line uses
    through a NearStore personality license that optimizes the
    system for data protection and retention workloads.

Virtual
    Tape Library

The NetApp NearStore VTL solution is a high-performance, easily
    managed system that significantly improves backup service levels
    and cost for traditional data center tape backup
    infrastructures. NearStore VTL ranges in capacity from 7TB to
    336TB and is based on NetApp system software optimized for the
    rapid sequential data throughputs seen in data center backup
    environments that use traditional backup applications such as
    Symantec

®

NetBackup

tm

and Tivoli Storage Manager.

NearStore VTL delivers value to backup customers in two
    fundamental ways: (1) it provides a far more reliable and
    high-performance storage target to backup applications than that
    provided by physical tape drives and libraries, thus enabling
    more backups to be done in less time; and (2) when backup
    data is moved directly from the NearStore VTL to physical tape
    drives and libraries, the NearStore VTL streams the data at a
    rate that provides for highly efficient utilization of
    customers’ existing tape infrastructure. The net benefits
    to the customer are that backup service levels improve
    substantially and expenditure on tape infrastructure is slowed.

Key differentiators of the NearStore VTL versus other VTL
    competition are its hardware-accelerated compression and tape
    smart sizing capabilities. Hardware-accelerated compression
    enables NearStore VTL to compress backup data onto disk at very
    high sequential throughput rates (up to 1900MB/sec in the most
    high-end NetApp VTL solution), thus enabling large amounts of
    customer data to be backed up in short amounts of time while
    using VTL disk very efficiently. Tape smart sizing enables
    physical tape utilization that is far more efficient than is
    possible with other VTLs that directly create physical tapes.

    manufacturers (“OEMs”), and distributors. In North
    America, Europe, and Australia, we employ a mix of resellers and
    direct sales channels to sell to end users. In Asia, Africa, and
    South America, our products are primarily sold through
    resellers, which are supported by channel sales representatives
    and technical support personnel. No single customer or
    distributor accounted for 10% or more of net sales in fiscal
    2007, 2006, or 2005.

The NetApp and IBM OEM agreement formed in fiscal year 2005
    allows IBM to sell IBM-branded solutions based on Network
    Appliance unified and open network-attached storage and iSCSI/IP
    SAN solutions, including NearStore and the NetApp V-Series
    systems, as well as associated software offerings.

    performance while lowering TCO.

We intend to continue to enhance our service offerings in this
    segment with additional capabilities by adding new resources and
    expertise.

Manufacturing

We have manufacturing operations in insourced and outsourced
    locations in Sunnyvale, San Jose, and Fremont, California;
    Livingston, Scotland; Shanghai, China; Tao Yuan Shien, Taiwan;
    and Schiphol Airport, The Netherlands. These operations include
    materials procurement, commodity management, component
    engineering, test engineering, manufacturing engineering,
    product assembly, product assurance, quality control, final
    test, and global logistics. We rely on a limited number of
    suppliers for materials, as well as several key subcontractors
    for the production of certain subassemblies and finished
    systems. We multisource wherever possible to mitigate supply
    risk. Our strategy has been to develop close relationships with
    our suppliers, exchanging critical information and implementing
    joint quality programs. We also use contract manufacturers for
    the production of major subassemblies to improve our
    manufacturing redundancy. This manufacturing strategy minimizes
    capital investments and overhead expenditures and creates
    flexibility for rapid expansion. We were awarded the ISO 9001
    certification on May 29, 1997; ISO 9001:2000 certification
    on December 3, 2003; and continue to be ISO 9001:2000
    certified. We were awarded ISO 14001:2004 certification on
    January 6, 2006.

See “Risk Factors — We rely on a limited number
    of suppliers” and “Risk Factors — The loss
    of our contract manufacturers.”

Research
    and Development

We conduct research and development activities in various
    locations throughout the world. In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    research and development expenses represented 13.7%, 12.2% and
    11.0% of our total revenue, respectively. These costs relate
    primarily to personnel and related costs incurred to conduct
    product development activities. Although we develop many of our
    products internally, we may acquire technology through business
    combinations or through licensing from third parties when
    appropriate. Our expenditures on research and development
    activities in the last three fiscal years are discussed below
    under Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Research and
    Development. We believe that technical leadership is essential
    to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial
    resources to research and development.

The research and development investment in fiscal year 2007
    continued to emphasize innovation and enterprise solutions. The
    storage platform family has been expanded from entry-level
    solutions through highly scalable clusters. This is represented
    by the StoreVault S500 at the low end through the FAS3040,
    FAS3070, FAS6030 and FAS6070 at the high end. The S500, ideally
    suited for SMBs, can be configured with a minimum of 1TB of
    storage. The highly clusterable FAS family can exceed a
    breakthrough 6PB in capacity. NetApp continues to be unique in
    running a single storage appliance operating system, Data ONTAP,
    across the breadth of our product line.

With the introduction of Data ONTAP GX in June 2006, NetApp
    delivered its most scalable solutions to date. This system can
    satisfy the most demanding capacity and I/O requirements found
    in the high-performance computing and technical application
    markets. The outstanding performance of this system was
    demonstrated by its ability to exceed 1 million operations
    per seconds using the industry standard and audited SPEC
    benchmark. This is more than triple the performance of the
    highest previously reported SPEC results.

Our software portfolio has grown over the past year. New network
    and protocol capabilities have been delivered throughout the
    year. Examples include support for 10 Gigabit Ethernet, iSCSI
    boot, Microsoft Simple



SAN, and Microsoft multipathing support. We have introduced new
    versions of SnapManager for Oracle, SnapManager for Microsoft
    Exchange and SnapManager for SAP. Protection Manager is now
    available and brings a new level of simplicity to automated
    backup and replication for disk-to-disk recovery. We have also
    delivered the next-generation autosupport system that is well
    integrated with NetApp Global Support services.

The V-Series product line has gained traction this year. The
    V-Series brings the NetApp ease of use and powerful
    virtualization capabilities to an expanded set of third-party
    storage arrays that include EMC, IBM, HP, HDS, Fujitsu, and
    others. Also, in FY07 we added new platforms to the product
    offering, including the V3040, V3070, V6030, and V6070.

The NetApp DataFort FC1020 was recognized as the
    “Innovation of the Year” by

PC Professional

in
    2006. The unique DataFort approach to encryption of data at
    rest, authentication, key management, and access control
    addresses the security requirements in demanding and regulated
    enterprise environments.

The NearStore VTL products experienced healthy growth throughout
    the year, especially among large enterprise customers, as
    several important new capabilities were added, including
    hardware-accelerated data compression, support for the ACSLS
    protocol required by many high-end tape libraries, and a
    doubling of both maximum system performance and storage
    capacity. The development of next-generation technologies such
    as deduplication is expected to further the adoption of NetApp
    disk-to-disk backup solutions as customers continue to repurpose
    and downsize their existing tape backup systems.

Our
    Topio

tm

acquisition allows for heterogeneous any-to-any data replication
    for disaster recovery, application support, and data migration.
    ReplicatorX

tm

enables IT organizations to replicate, recover, and protect data
    over any distance regardless of the source or target storage
    solution. Furthermore, due to ReplicatorX and Data ONTAP
    integration, it allows a broad set of potential customers to
    quickly and easily benefit from the powerful Data ONTAP
    capabilities such as FlexVol and FlexClone.

See “Risk Factors — If we are unable to develop
    and introduce new products and respond to technological change,
    or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance, our
    operating results could be materially adversely affected.”

Segment
    and Geographic Information

See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financials Statements
    accompanying this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Customer
    Base

Our diversified customer base spans a number of large segments
    and vertical markets. Examples include:

•

Energy.

Customers in the energy market have
    traditionally deployed our products to support their upstream
    seismic analysis, exploration and production, and downstream
    refining and distribution activities, where the simplicity of
    the appliance architecture and the ability to support massive
    amounts of data are critical. Our solutions help enable energy
    companies to meet their workflow optimization objectives,
    improve quality, reduce cycle times, and lower costs.

•

Financial services.

New data-processing
    methodologies, shorter time frames for settlement transactions,
    and new demands for better knowledge management have required
    financial services firms to improve their data storage
    infrastructures. Network Appliance solutions for enterprise
    storage enable these financial institutions to effectively
    manage large amounts of data in a high-speed distributed
    infrastructure, enabling customers to leverage their existing
    technology investments and derive maximum value from their
    time-sensitive information.

•

Government.

State and local government
    agencies, U.S. Federal and international governments are
    continually challenged with the critical tasks of effectively
    managing to the health and welfare of their domestic
    constituents, and as a result, represent the largest set of IT
    consumers in the world. Whether conducting civilian program
    operations or analyzing intelligence to assess criminal and
    military threats, governments rely on NetApp to provide highly
    secure and cost effective solutions.



•

High technology.

Global technology
    enterprises, including semiconductor, systems, and software
    companies, are keenly focused on reducing infrastructure cost
    and improving time to market. Network Appliance solutions enable
    high-technology firms to achieve these goals by reducing TCO and
    providing highly reliable systems and fast data access, thereby
    reducing the time required for software builds and chip
    simulations.

•

Internet.

Internet-focused businesses place
    considerable and often unpredictable demands on
    transaction-intensive, database-driven environments such as

e-mail,

World Wide Web (“WWW”), and electronic commerce

(“e-commerce”).

In a marketplace where retaining customer loyalty is paramount,
    Internet-focused businesses must have high performance and
    readily available data to ensure that their customers do not
    seek alternative providers. Scalable distributed architectures
    based on Network Appliance products improve data availability,
    scalability, and performance, while reducing TCO.

•

Life sciences and healthcare
    services.

Pharmaceutical, bioresearch, genomic
    research, and clinical-care providers are focused on developing
    vital new drugs, improving quality of patient care, and
    increasing their returns on investment. Network Appliance
    solutions enable fast access, integration, and sharing of
    massive amounts of exponentially growing scientific and medical
    imaging data; reduced time to market; and improvements in
    operational efficiency.

•

Major manufacturing.

Global manufacturing
    companies face intense competitive pressure to develop
    attractive new products, improve time to market, and optimize
    profitability. Network Appliance solutions enable these
    companies to simplify the management overhead associated with
    storing and protecting large amounts of ERP, engineering, and
    manufacturing product data, while ensuring that information can
    be easily and efficiently distributed to manufacturing and
    distribution sites around the world.

•

Media, entertainment, animation and video
    postproduction.

Digital artists create and
    maintain large libraries of models, textures, and scene
    generation instructions that are exploited by Linux compute
    farms to create complex special effects for games, movies, and
    advertisements. Increasing desire for more dazzling, realistic
    effects places stringent performance and reliability demands on
    shared storage systems at the core of the production process.
    Our scalable storage configurations deliver the performance,
    reliability, and manageability that allow video and movie
    production customers to meet ever-increasing demands for more
    imaginative effects.

•

Telecommunications.

Service providers in the
    telecommunications industry are faced with deregulation,
    globalization, increased competition, and often a substantial
    debt burden. As a result, they must control infrastructure costs
    while maintaining or improving services to existing customers
    and at the same time identifying and developing compelling new
    revenue streams in order to grow their business. Network
    Appliance products and solutions allow these providers to
    quickly and cost-effectively build the network storage
    infrastructure and content delivery networks required by the
    global telecommunications industry.

Seasonality

Our operating results have not been significantly affected by
    seasonality in the past. In the future, as we expand our
    presence internationally and into other vertical markets, we may
    experience more seasonality in the sale of our products. For
    example, sales to European customers tend to be weaker in the
    summer months and sales to the U.S. government are
    typically stronger in the third calendar quarter.

See “Risk Factors — Factors beyond our control
    could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate” and
    “Risk Factors — Risks inherent in our
    international operations could have a material adverse effect on
    our operating results accompanying this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.”

Backlog

Network Appliance manufactures products based on a combination
    of specific order requirements and forecasts of our
    customers’ demand. Orders are generally placed by customers
    on an as-needed basis. Products are typically shipped within one
    to four weeks following receipt of an order. In certain
    circumstances, customers may



cancel or reschedule orders without penalty. For these reasons,
    “orders” may not constitute a firm backlog and may not
    be a meaningful indicator of revenues.

See “Risk Factors — Factors beyond our control
    could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate.”

Competition

The storage market is intensely competitive and is characterized
    by rapidly changing technology and rapidly changing business
    models.

In the storage market, our primary and near-line storage system
    products and our associated storage software portfolio compete
    primarily with storage system products and data management
    software from EMC, HDS, HP, IBM, and Sun Microsystems. We also
    see Dell, Inc. (“Dell”) as an emerging competitor in
    the storage marketplace, primarily due to the business
    partnership that has been established between Dell and EMC,
    allowing Dell to resell EMC storage hardware and software
    products. We have also historically encountered less-frequent
    competition from companies including the Storage Systems Group
    of LSI Logic Corporation (“LSI Logic”). In the
    near-line storage market, which includes the disk-to-disk backup
    and regulated data storage segments, our NearStore appliances
    compete primarily against products from EMC and Sun
    Microsystems, as a result of their acquisition of StorageTek
    Technology Corporation. Our NearStore VTL appliances also
    compete directly with traditional tape backup solutions in the
    broader data backup/recovery space.

Additionally, a number of small, new companies are currently
    attempting to enter the storage systems and data management
    software markets, the near-line and VTL storage markets, and the
    storage security markets, some of which may become significant
    competitors in the future. We believe that the principal
    competitive factors affecting the storage and storage security
    markets include product benefits such as response time,
    reliability, data availability, scalability, ease of use, price,
    multiprotocol capabilities, professional services and customer
    service and support.

See “Risk Factors — An increase in competition
    could materially and adversely affect our operating
    results” and “Risk Factors — If we are
    unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to
    technological change, or if our new products do not achieve
    market acceptance.”

Proprietary
    Rights

We currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark
    laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual
    provisions, and patents to protect our proprietary rights. We
    seek to protect our software, documentation, and other written
    materials under trade secret, copyright, and patent laws, which
    afford only limited protection. We have registered our Network
    Appliance name and logo, Data ONTAP, DataFabric,
    FAServer

®

,
    FlexVol, FilerView, NearStore, NetApp, NetCache, SecureShare,
    SnapDrive, SnapLock, SnapManager, SnapMirror, SnapRestore,
    SnapVault, WAFL, and others as trademarks in the U.S.. Other
    U.S. trademarks and some of the other U.S. registered
    trademarks are registered internationally as well. We will
    continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks
    as appropriate. We generally enter into confidentiality
    agreements with our employees, resellers, and customers. We
    currently have multiple U.S. and international patent
    applications pending and multiple U.S. patents issued.

See “Risk Factors — If we are unable to protect
    our intellectual property, we may be subject to increased
    competition that could materially adversely affect our operating
    results.”

Environmental
    Disclosure

Various federal state and local provisions regulate the use and
    discharge of certain hazardous materials used in our
    manufacturing. Failure to comply with environmental regulations
    in the future could cause us to incur substantial costs or
    subject us to business interruptions. We believe we are fully
    compliant with all applicable environmental laws.

See “Risk Factors — Our business is subject to
    changing laws and regulations, environmental legislation”
    accompanying this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

The following risk factors and other information included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties
    described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks
    and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently
    deem less significant may also impair our business operations.
    Please see page 2 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional discussion of these forward-looking statements.
    If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business,
    operating results, and financial condition could be materially
    adversely affected.

Factors
    beyond our control could cause our quarterly results to
    fluctuate, which could adversely impact our common stock
    price.

We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of
    operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be
    relied upon as indicators of future performance. Many of the
    factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to
    fluctuate significantly in the future are beyond our control and
    include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

Changes in general economic conditions and specific economic
    conditions in the computer, storage, and networking industries

•

General decrease in global corporate spending on information
    technology leading to a decline in demand for our products

•

A shift in federal government spending patterns

•

The possible effects of terrorist activity and international
    conflicts, which could lead to business interruptions and
    difficulty in forecasting

•

The level of competition in our target product markets

•

Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers due to industry
    consolidation, which could subject us to periodic

supply-and-demand,

price rigidity, and quality issues with our components

•

The size, timing, and cancellation of significant orders

•

Product configuration and mix

•

The extent to which our customers renew their service and
    maintenance contracts with us

•

Market acceptance of new products and product enhancements

•

Announcements, introductions, and transitions of new products by
    us or our competitors



•

Deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or
    product enhancements introduced by us or our competitors

•

Changes in pricing by us in response to competitive pricing
    actions

•

Our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products and
    enhancements in a timely manner

•

Supply constraints

•

Technological changes in our target product markets

•

The levels of expenditure on research and development and sales
    and marketing programs

•

Our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions

•

Excess or inadequate facilities

•

Disruptions resulting from new systems and processes as we
    continue to enhance and adapt our system infrastructure to
    accommodate future growth

•

Future accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting
    policies

•

Seasonality

In addition, sales for any future quarter may vary and
    accordingly be different from what we forecast. We manufacture
    products based on a combination of specific order requirements
    and forecasts of our customer demands. Products are typically
    shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order.
    In certain circumstances, customers may cancel or reschedule
    orders without penalty. Product sales are also difficult to
    forecast because the storage and data management market is
    rapidly evolving and our sales cycle varies substantially from
    customer to customer.

We derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from
    orders booked in the same quarter. Bookings typically follow
    intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end
    of the quarter. If we do not achieve bookings in the latter part
    of a quarter consistent with our quarterly financial targets,
    our financial results will be adversely impacted. If revenues do
    not meet our expectations, our operating profit may be
    negatively impacted because portions of our expenses are fixed
    and difficult to reduce in a short period of time. If our
    revenues are lower than expected, our fixed expenses could
    adversely affect our net income and cash flow until revenues
    increase or until such fixed expenses are reduced to a level
    commensurate with revenues.

For example, due to macroeconomic conditions and an IT spending
    slowdown in the U.S., our fourth quarter fiscal 2007 bookings
    were back-end loaded and finished lower than our forecast. In
    addition, in the last two weeks of the fourth quarter in fiscal
    2007, we experienced a shift in the mix of our bookings towards
    more deferred elements. As a result, we did not build our normal
    levels of non-deferred backlog at the end of the fourth quarter,
    which will impact the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Without the
    benefit of normal backlog, we do not expect our usual level of
    growth in first quarter revenue, and as a result, our expense
    levels as a percentage of our revenue will be above our targeted
    business model. Given the lack of growth in our non-deferred
    backlog, we lowered our forecasts for the first quarter of
    fiscal 2008 in revenues, operating margins and earnings.

Due to all of the foregoing factors, it is possible that in one
    or more future quarters our results may fall below our forecasts
    and the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In
    such event, the trading price of our common stock would likely
    decrease.

The
    marketplace for our common stock has fluctuated significantly in
    the past and will likely continue to do so in the
    future.

The market price for our common stock has experienced
    substantial volatility in the past, and several factors could
    cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These
    factors include but are not limited to:

•

Fluctuations in our operating results

•

Variations between our operating results and either the guidance
    we have furnished to the public or the published expectations of
    securities analysts



•

Fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by
    investors to be comparable to us

•

Changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections

•

Inquiries by the SEC, NASDAQ, law enforcement, or other
    regulatory bodies

•

Economic developments in the storage and data management market
    as a whole

•

International conflicts and acts of terrorism

•

Announcements of new products, applications, or product
    enhancements by us or our competitors

•

Changes in our relationships with our suppliers, customers, and
    channel and strategic partners

•

General market conditions

In addition, the stock market has experienced volatility that
    has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities
    of many technology companies. Additionally, certain
    macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates, the
    market climate for the technology sector, and levels of
    corporate spending on information technology could also have an
    impact on the trading price of our stock. As a result, the
    market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in
    the future, and any broad market decline, as well as our own
    operating results, may materially and adversely affect the
    market price of our common stock.

Macroeconomic conditions and IT spending slowdown in the U.S as
    well as variations in our expected operating performance may
    continue to cause volatility in our stock price. We are unable
    to predict changes in general economic conditions and when
    global IT spending rates will be affected. Furthermore, if there
    are future reductions in either domestic or international IT
    spending rates, or if IT spending rates do not increase, our
    revenues, operating results and stock price may continue to be
    adversely affected.

Our
    forecasts of our revenues and earnings outlook may be inaccurate
    and could materially and adversely impact our business or our
    planned results of operations.

Our revenues are difficult to forecast. We use a
    “pipeline” system, a common industry practice, to
    forecast revenues and trends in our business. Sales personnel
    monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a
    customer will make a purchase decision, the dollar amount of the
    sale and the products or services to be sold. These estimates
    are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our
    pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a
    particular quarter or over a longer period of time, in part
    because the “conversion rate” of the pipeline into
    contracts varies from customer to customer, can be difficult to
    estimate and requires management judgment. Small deviations from
    our forecasted conversion rate may result in inaccurate plans
    and budgets and materially adversely impact our business or our
    planned results of operations. In particular, a slowdown in IT
    spending or weak economic conditions or evolving technology
    generally can reduce the conversion rate in a particular quarter
    as our customers’ purchasing decisions are delayed, reduced
    in amount or cancelled. Moreover, even after contracts have been
    executed, extensive analysis is required before the timing of
    revenue recognition can be reliably determined; this delay
    reflects both the complexity of the revenue recognition rules
    applicable to software and the effect that the multiple element
    arrangements and other terms and conditions can have when these
    rules are applied.

If we
    are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to
    technological change, if our new products do not achieve market
    acceptance, or if we fail to manage the transition between our
    new and old products, or if we cannot provide the level of
    service and support for our new products, our operating results
    could be materially and adversely affected.

Our future growth depends upon the successful development and
    introduction of new hardware and software products. Due to the
    complexity of storage subsystems and storage security
    appliances, and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort
    required to produce new products, such products are subject to
    significant technical risks. However, our new products may not
    achieve market acceptance. Additional product introductions in
    future periods may also impact our sales of existing products.
    In addition, our new products must respond to technological
    changes and evolving industry standards. If we are unable, for
    technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new



products in a timely manner in response to changing market
    conditions or customer requirements, or if such products do not
    achieve market acceptance, our operating results could be
    materially and adversely affected.

As new or enhanced products are introduced, we must successfully
    manage the transition from older products in order to minimize
    disruption in customers’ ordering patterns, avoid excessive
    levels of older product inventories, and ensure that enough
    supplies of new products can be delivered to meet
    customers’ demands.

As we enter into new or emerging markets, we will likely
    increase demands on our service and support operations and may
    be exposed to additional competition. We may not be able to
    provide products, service, and support to effectively compete
    for these market opportunities. Further, provision of greater
    levels of services from us may result in a delay in the timing
    of revenue recognition.

An
    increase in competition could materially and adversely affect
    our operating results.

The storage markets are intensely competitive and are
    characterized by rapidly changing technology. In the storage
    market, our primary and nearline storage system products and our
    associated storage software portfolio compete primarily with
    storage system products and data management software from EMC,
    HDS, HP, IBM, and Sun/StorageTek. We also see Dell, Inc. as a
    competitor in the storage marketplace, primarily through its
    business partnership with EMC, allowing Dell to resell EMC
    storage hardware and software products. We have also
    historically encountered less-frequent competition from
    companies including LSI Logic. In the secondary storage market,
    which includes the disk-to-disk backup, compliance, and business
    continuity segments, our solutions compete primarily against
    products from EMC and Sun/StorageTek. Our NearStore VTL
    appliances also compete with traditional tape backup solutions
    in the broader data backup/recovery space. Additionally, a
    number of small, new, privately-held companies are currently
    attempting to enter the storage systems and data management
    software markets and the near-line and NearStore VTL storage
    markets, some of which may become significant competitors in the
    future.

There has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our
    markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as
    companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions
    in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are
    unable to continue operations. We believe that industry
    consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better
    able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. In
    addition, current and potential competitors have established or
    may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with
    third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors
    or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire
    significant market share. We cannot assure you that we will be
    able to compete successfully against current or future
    competitors. Competitive pressures we face could materially and
    adversely affect our operating results.

We
    rely on a limited number of suppliers, and any disruption or
    termination of these supply arrangements could delay shipment of
    our products and could materially and adversely affect our
    operating results.

We rely on a limited number of suppliers for components such as
    disk drives, computer boards, and microprocessors utilized in
    the assembly of our products. In recent years, rapid industry
    consolidation has led to fewer component suppliers, which could
    subject us to periodic supply constraints and price rigidity.

Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several
    risks, including:

•

A potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required
    components because we do not have long-term supply commitments

•

Supplier capacity constraints

•

Price increases

•

Timely delivery

•

Component quality

Component quality is particularly significant with respect to
    our suppliers of disk drives. In order to meet product
    performance requirements, we must obtain disk drives of
    extremely high quality and capacity. In addition, there are
    periodic

supply-and-demand

issues for disk drives, microprocessors, and semiconductor
    memory



components, which could result in component shortages, selective
    supply allocations, and increased prices of such components. We
    cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain our full
    requirements of such components in the future or that prices of
    such components will not increase. In addition, problems with
    respect to yield and quality of such components and timeliness
    of deliveries could occur. Disruption or termination of the
    supply of these components could delay shipments of our products
    and could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
    Such delays could also damage relationships with current and
    prospective customers and suppliers.

In addition, we license certain technology and software from
    third parties that are incorporated into our products. If we are
    unable to obtain or license the technology and software on a
    timely basis, we will not be able to deliver products to our
    customers in a timely manner.

The
    loss of any contract manufacturers or the failure to accurately
    forecast demand for our products or successfully manage our
    relationships with our contract manufacturers could negatively
    impact our ability to manufacture and sell our
    products.

We currently rely on several contract manufacturers to
    manufacture most of our products. Our reliance on our
    third-party contract manufacturers reduces our control over the
    manufacturing process, exposing us to risks, including reduced
    control over quality assurance, production costs, and product
    supply. If we should fail to effectively manage our
    relationships with our contract manufacturers, or if our
    contract manufacturers experience delays, disruptions, capacity
    constraints, or quality control problems in their manufacturing
    operations, our ability to ship products to our customers could
    be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could be
    harmed. Qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing
    volume production are expensive and time-consuming. If we are
    required to change contract manufacturers or assume internal
    manufacturing operations, we may lose revenue and damage our
    customer relationships. If we inaccurately forecast demand for
    our products, we may have excess or inadequate inventory or
    incur cancellation charges or penalties, which could adversely
    impact our operating results. As of April 27, 2007, we have
    no purchase commitment under these agreements.

We intend to regularly introduce new products and product
    enhancements, which will require us to rapidly achieve volume
    production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and
    suppliers. We may need to increase our material purchases,
    contract manufacturing capacity, and internal test and quality
    functions to meet anticipated demand. The inability of our
    contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of
    high-quality products, or the inability to obtain raw materials,
    could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders.

Our
    future financial performance depends on growth in the storage
    and data management markets. If these markets do not continue to
    grow at the rates at which we forecast growth, our operating
    results will be materially and adversely impacted.

All of our products address the storage and data management
    markets. Accordingly, our future financial performance will
    depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and data
    management markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging
    standards in these markets. We cannot assure you that the
    markets for storage and data management will continue to grow or
    that emerging standards in these markets will not adversely
    affect the growth of UNIX, Windows, and the World Wide Web
    server markets upon which we depend.

For example, we provide our open access data retention solutions
    to customers within the financial services, healthcare,
    pharmaceuticals, and government market segments, industries that
    are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with
    respect to data access, reliability, and permanence (such as
    Rule 17(a)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended) in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we
    operate. If our products do not meet, and continue to comply
    with, these evolving governmental regulations in this regard,
    customers in these market and geographical segments will not
    purchase our products, and therefore we will not be able to
    expand our product offerings in these market and geographical
    segments at the rates for which we have forecast.



We are
    also exposed to unfavorable economic and market conditions and
    the uncertain geopolitical environment.

Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable
    economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical
    environment. A reduction in demand for storage and data
    management caused by weakening economic conditions and decreases
    in corporate spending will result in decreased revenues and
    lower revenue growth rates. The network storage market growth
    declined significantly beginning in the third quarter of fiscal
    2001 through fiscal 2003, causing both our revenues and
    operating results to decline. If the storage and data management
    markets grow more slowly than anticipated, or if emerging
    standards other than those adopted by us become increasingly
    accepted by these markets, our operating results could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Recent turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of
    the world, including terrorist activities and military actions,
    particularly the continuing tension in and surrounding Iraq, and
    changes in energy costs may continue to put pressure on global
    economic conditions. If the economic and market conditions in
    the U.S. and globally do not improve, or if they
    deteriorate, we may experience material impacts on our business,
    operating results, and financial condition.

Our
    gross margins may vary based on the configuration of our product
    and service solutions, and such variation may make it more
    difficult to forecast our earnings.

We derive a significant portion of our sales from the resale of
    disk drives as components of our storage systems, and the resale
    market for hard disk drives is highly competitive and subject to
    intense pricing pressures. Our sales of disk drives generate
    lower gross margin percentages than those of our storage
    systems. As a result, as we sell more highly configured systems
    with greater disk drive content, overall gross margin
    percentages may be negatively affected.

Our gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a
    variety of other factors, including:

•

Demand for storage and data management products

•

Discount levels and price competition

•

Direct versus indirect and OEM sales

•

Product and add-on software mix

•

The mix of services as a percentage of revenue

•

The mix and average selling prices of products

•

The mix of disk content

•

New product introductions and enhancements

•

Excess inventory purchase commitments as a result of changes in
    demand forecasts and possible product and software defects as we
    transition our products

•

The cost of components, manufacturing labor, and quality

Changes in service gross margins may result from various factors
    such as continued investments in our customer support
    infrastructure and changes in the mix between technical support
    services and professional services, as well as the timing of
    technical support service contract initiations and renewals.

Our
    effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate, which could
    increase our income tax expense and reduce our net
    income.

Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several
    factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:

•

Earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are
    taxed at lower rates as compared to the U.S. statutory tax
    rate



•

Material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates as
    a result of a shift in the mix of pretax profits and losses by
    tax jurisdiction, our ability to use tax credits, or effective
    tax rates by tax jurisdiction different than our estimates

•

Changing tax laws, accounting standards, including
    SFAS No. 123R and FIN No. 48, regulations,
    and interpretations in multiple tax jurisdictions in which we
    operate, as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings

•

An increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes,
    including certain stock-based compensation expense, write-offs
    of acquired in-process research and development, and impairment
    of goodwill

•

The tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and
    restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between
    reporting periods

•

Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
    liabilities

•

Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws

•

Tax assessments, or any related tax interest or penalties, could
    significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in
    which the settlements take place

•

A change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign
    earnings

The price of our common stock could decline to the extent that
    our financial results are materially affected by an adverse
    change in our effective tax rate. We are currently undergoing
    federal income tax audits in the U.S. and several foreign
    tax jurisdictions. The rights to some of our intellectual
    property (“IP”) are owned by certain of our foreign
    subsidiaries, and payments are made between U.S. and
    foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this IP.
    Recently, some other companies have had their foreign IP
    arrangements challenged as part of an examination. Our
    management does not believe, based upon information currently
    known to us that the final resolution of any of our audits will
    have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial
    position and the results of operations and cash flows. If the
    ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these tax
    jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we
    have recorded or reserved for, our operating results, cash
    flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We may
    face increased risks and uncertainties related to our current or
    future acquisitions and nonmarketable securities, and these
    investments may not achieve our objectives.

As part of our strategy, we are continuously evaluating
    opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would
    complement our current products, expand the breadth of our
    markets, or enhance our technical capabilities. We may engage in
    future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders’
    investments and cause us to use cash, to incur debt, or to
    assume contingent liabilities.

Acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks, and we may not
    be able to successfully integrate acquired operations and
    products or to realize anticipated synergies, economies of
    scale, or other value. Integration risks and issues may include,
    but are not limited to, key personnel retention and
    assimilation, management distraction, technical development, and
    unexpected costs and liabilities, including goodwill impairment
    charges. In addition, we may be unable to recover strategic
    investments in development stage entities. Any such problems
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition, and results of operation.

On occasion, we invest in nonmarketable securities of private
    companies. As of April 27, 2007, the carrying value of our
    investments in nonmarketable securities totaled
    $8.9 million. Investments in nonmarketable securities are
    inherently risky, and some of these companies are likely to
    fail. Their success (or lack thereof) is dependent on these
    companies product development, market acceptance, operational
    efficiency and other key business success factors. In addition,
    depending on these companies’ future prospects, they may
    not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may
    receive lower valuations, with less favorable investment terms
    than in previous financings, and our investments in them would
    likely become impaired. In fiscal 2007, we recorded a
    $2.1 million write-down relating to our investments in two
    privately-held companies.



We
    cannot assure you that our OEM relationship with IBM will
    generate significant revenue.

In April 2005, we announced a strategic partner relationship
    with IBM. As part of the relationship, we entered into an
    original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”) agreement
    that enables IBM to sell IBM branded solutions based on Network
    Appliance unified solutions, including NearStore and the NetApp
    V-Series systems, as well as associated software offerings.
    While this agreement is an element of our strategy to expand our
    reach into more customers and countries, we do not have an
    exclusive relationship with IBM, and there is no minimum
    commitment for any given period of time; therefore we cannot
    assure you that this relationship will contribute any revenue in
    future years. In addition, we have no control over the products
    that IBM selects to sell, or their release schedule and timing
    of those products; nor do we control their pricing. In the event
    that sales through IBM will increase, we may experience
    distribution channel conflicts between our direct sales force
    and IBM, or among our channel partners. If we fail to minimize
    channel conflicts, our operating results and financial condition
    could be harmed. In addition, since this agreement is relatively
    new, we do not have a history upon which to base our analysis of
    its future success.

Currently we do not and cannot assure you that this OEM
    relationship will generate significant revenue or that this
    strategic partnership will continue to be in effect for any
    specific period of time.

If we
    are unable to maintain our existing relationships and develop
    new relationships with major strategic partners, our revenue may
    be impacted negatively.

An element of our strategy to increase revenue is to
    strategically partner with major third-party software and
    hardware vendors that integrate our products into their products
    and also comarket our products with these vendors. We have
    significant partner relationships with database, business
    application, and backup management companies, including
    Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and Symantec. A number of these
    strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded
    access to segments of the storage market. There is intense
    competition for attractive strategic partners, and even if we
    can establish strategic relationships with these partners, we
    cannot assure you that these partnerships will generate
    significant revenue or that the partnerships will continue to be
    in effect for any specific period of time.

We intend to continue to establish and maintain business
    relationships with technology companies to accelerate the
    development and marketing of our storage solutions. To the
    extent that we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships
    and maintaining our existing relationships, our future revenue
    and operating results could be impacted negatively. In addition,
    the loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse
    effect on the progress of our new products under development
    with that partner.

We
    cannot assure you that we are able to maintain existing
    resellers and attract new resellers, and that channel conflicts
    will not materially adversely affect our channel relationships.
    In addition, we do not have exclusive relationships with our
    resellers and accordingly there is a risk that those resellers
    may give higher priority to products of other suppliers, which
    could materially adversely affect our operating
    results.

We market and sell our storage solutions directly through our
    worldwide sales force and indirectly through channels such as
    value-added resellers (“VAR”), systems integrators,
    distributors, OEMs, and strategic business partners, and we
    derive a significant portion of our revenue from these indirect
    channel partners. In fiscal 2007, our indirect channels
    accounted for 59.6% of our consolidated revenues.

However, in order for us to maintain our current revenue sources
    and grow our revenue as we have forecasted, we must effectively
    manage our relationships with these indirect channel partners.
    To do so, we must attract and retain a sufficient number of
    qualified channel partners to successfully market our products.
    However, because we also sell our products directly to customers
    through our sales force, on occasion we compete with our
    indirect channels for sales of our products to our end
    customers, competition that could result in conflicts with these
    indirect channel partners and make it harder for us to attract
    and retain these indirect channel partners. At the same time,
    our indirect channel partners may offer products that are
    competitive to ours. In addition, because our reseller partners
    generally offer products from several different companies,
    including products of our competitors, these resellers may give
    higher priority to the marketing, sales, and support of our
    competitors’ products than ours. If we fail to effectively
    manage our relationships with these indirect channel partners to
    minimize channel conflict and continue to evaluate and meet our
    indirect sales partners’ needs with respect to our
    products, we will not be able to maintain



or increase our revenue as we have forecasted, which would have
    a materially adverse affect on our business, financial
    condition, and results of operations. Additionally, if we do not
    manage distribution of our products and services and support
    effectively, or if our resellers’ financial conditions or
    operations weaken, our revenues and gross margins could be
    adversely affected.

Risks
    inherent in our international operations could have a material
    adverse effect on our operating results.

We conduct business internationally. For the year ended
    April 27, 2007, 44.7% of our total revenues was from
    international customers (including U.S. exports).
    Accordingly, our future operating results could be materially
    and adversely affected by a variety of factors, some of which
    are beyond our control, including regulatory, political, or
    economic conditions in a specific country or region, trade
    protection measures and other regulatory requirements,
    government spending patterns, and acts of terrorism and
    international conflicts.

Our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and
    in foreign currencies. An increase in the value of the
    U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our
    products more expensive and therefore potentially less
    competitive in foreign markets. Conversely, lowering our price
    in local currency may result in lower

U.S.-based

revenue. For international sales and expenditures denominated in
    foreign currencies, we are subject to risks associated with
    currency fluctuations. We utilize forward and option contracts
    to hedge our foreign currency exposure associated with certain
    assets and liabilities as well as anticipated foreign currency
    cash flows. All balance sheet hedges are marked to market
    through earnings every quarter, while gains and losses on cash
    flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income until
    forecasted transactions occur, at which time such realized gains
    and losses are recognized in earnings. These hedges attempt to
    reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of
    currency exchange movements. Factors that could have an impact
    on the effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy
    of forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets.
    There can be no assurance that such hedging strategies will be
    successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not
    have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

Additional risks inherent in our international business
    activities generally include, among others, longer accounts
    receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing
    international operations. Such factors could materially and
    adversely affect our future international sales and consequently
    our operating results.

We receive significant tax benefits from sales to our

non-U.S. customers.

These benefits are contingent upon existing tax regulations in
    the U.S. and in the countries in which our international
    operations are located. Future changes in domestic or
    international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability
    to continue to realize these tax benefits. Our effective tax
    rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving
    interpretations of existing law or regulations. Potentially
    adverse tax consequences could negatively impact the operating
    and financial results from international operations.
    International operations currently benefit from a tax ruling
    concluded in the Netherlands.

Our operating results have not been significantly affected by
    seasonality in the past. In the future, as we expand our
    presence internationally, we may experience more seasonality in
    the sale of our products. For example, sales to European
    customers tend to be weaker in the summer months, which is our
    first fiscal quarter.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or
    increase international market demand for our products.

If we
    fail to manage our expanding business effectively, our operating
    results could be materially and adversely
    affected.

Our future operating results depend to a large extent on
    management’s ability to successfully manage expansion and
    growth, including but not limited to expanding international
    operations, forecasting revenues, addressing new markets,
    controlling expenses, implementing and enhancing infrastructure,
    investing in people, facilities and capital equipment, and
    managing our assets. An unexpected decline in the growth rate of
    revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expense
    growth or a failure to manage other aspects of growth could
    materially and adversely affect our operating results.



In addition, continued expansion could strain our current
    management, financial, manufacturing, and other systems, and may
    require us to implement and improve those systems. If we
    experience any problems with any improvement or expansion of
    these systems, procedures, or controls, or if these systems,
    procedures or controls are not designed, implemented, or
    improved in a cost-effective and timely manner, our operations
    may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any
    failure to implement, improve, and expand such systems,
    procedures, and controls in a timely and efficient manner could
    harm our growth strategy and materially and adversely affect our
    financial condition and ability to achieve our business
    objectives.

As we
    continue to grow our business, we are likely to incur costs
    earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, which could harm
    our operating results. A significant percentage of our expenses
    are fixed, which could materially and adversely affect our net
    income.

We are increasing our investment in engineering, sales, service
    support, and other functions to grow our business. We are likely
    to recognize the costs associated with these increased
    investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and
    the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop
    more slowly, than we expect, which could harm our business.

Our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to
    future sales, and a significant percentage of our expenses are
    fixed. As a result, if sales levels are below expectations or
    previously higher levels, net income will be disproportionately
    affected in a material and adverse manner.

We
    depend on the ability of our personnel, raw materials,
    equipment, and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the
    world. Our business could be materially and adversely affected
    as a result of a natural disaster, terrorist acts, or other
    catastrophic events.

Any political, military, world health (e.g., SARS, avian flu),
    or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the
    import or export of materials could lead to significant business
    disruptions. Furthermore, any strike, economic failure, or other
    material disruption caused by fire, floods, hurricanes, power
    loss, power shortages, telecommunications failures, break-ins,
    and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to
    conduct business. If such disruptions result in cancellations of
    customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic
    activity or corporate spending on information technology, or
    directly impact our marketing, manufacturing, financial, and
    logistics functions, our results of operations and financial
    condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition,
    our headquarters are located in Northern California, an area
    susceptible to earthquakes. If any significant disaster were to
    occur, our ability to operate our business could be impaired.

We
    depend on attracting and retaining qualified technical and sales
    personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain such
    personnel, our operating results could be materially and
    adversely impacted.

Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to
    identify, attract, motivate, and retain qualified technical and
    sales personnel. Because our future success is dependent on our
    ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products, we
    are particularly dependent on our ability to identify, attract,
    motivate, and retain qualified engineers with the requisite
    education, background, and industry experience. Competition for
    qualified engineers, particularly in Silicon Valley, can be
    intense. The loss of the services of a significant number of our
    engineers or salespeople could be disruptive to our development
    efforts or business relationships and could materially and
    adversely affect our operating results.

Undetected
    software errors, hardware errors, or failures found in new
    products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of
    our products, which could increase our costs and reduce our
    revenues. Product quality problems could lead to reduced
    revenue, gross margins, and net income.

Our products may contain undetected software errors, hardware
    errors, or failures when first introduced or as new versions are
    released. Despite testing by us and by current and potential
    customers, errors may not be found in



new products until after commencement of commercial shipments,
    resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance, which could
    materially and adversely affect our operating results.

If we fail to remedy a product defect, we may experience a
    failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal
    from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory
    costs, or product reengineering expenses, any of which could
    have a material impact on our revenue, margins, and net income.

In addition, we may be subject to losses that may result or are
    alleged to result from defects in our products, which could
    subject us to claims for damages, including consequential
    damages. Based on our historical experience, we believe that the
    risk of exposure to product liability claims is currently low.
    However, should we experience increased exposure to product
    liability claims, our business could be adversely impacted.

We are
    exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims
    and protection of intellectual property rights, which could
    adversely affect our operating results.

We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business.
    Litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal
    business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal
    proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution
    of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on
    our business, operating results, or financial condition.

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may be
    subject to increased competition that could materially and
    adversely affect our operating results. Our success depends
    significantly upon our proprietary technology. We rely on a
    combination of copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets,
    confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and patents
    to protect our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our
    software, documentation, and other written materials under trade
    secret, copyright, and patent laws, which afford only limited
    protection. Some U.S. trademarks and some

U.S.-registered

trademarks are registered internationally as well. We will
    continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks
    as appropriate. We generally enter into confidentiality
    agreements with our employees and with our resellers, strategic
    partners, and customers. We currently have multiple
    U.S. and international patent applications pending and
    multiple U.S. patents issued. The pending applications may
    not be approved, and if patents are issued, such patents may be
    challenged. If such challenges are brought, the patents may be
    invalidated. We cannot assure you that we will develop
    proprietary products or technologies that are patentable, that
    any issued patent will provide us with any competitive
    advantages or will not be challenged by third parties, or that
    the patents of others will not materially and adversely affect
    our ability to do business.

Litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary
    technology. Any such litigation may be time consuming and
    costly. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,
    unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products
    or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
    In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect
    proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the
    U.S.. We cannot assure you that our means of protecting our
    proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will
    not independently develop similar technology, duplicate our
    products, or design around patents issued to us or other
    intellectual property rights of ours.

We are subject to intellectual property infringement claims. We
    may, from time to time, receive claims that we are infringing
    third parties’ intellectual property rights. Third parties
    may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to
    current or future products, patents, trademarks, or other
    proprietary rights. We expect that companies in the appliance
    market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as
    the number of products and competitors in our industry segment
    grows and the functionality of products in different industry
    segments overlaps. Any such claims could be time consuming,
    result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays,
    require us to redesign our products, or require us to enter into
    royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could materially
    and adversely affect our operating results. Such royalty or
    licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms
    acceptable to us or at all.



Our
    business is subject to increasingly complex corporate
    governance, public disclosure, accounting, and tax requirements
    that have increased both our costs and the risk of
    noncompliance.

Because our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to
    certain rules and regulations of federal, state, and financial
    market exchange entities charged with the protection of
    investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are
    publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC, and NASDAQ, have
    implemented new requirements and regulations and continue
    developing additional regulations and requirements in response
    to recent corporate scandals and laws enacted by Congress, most
    notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our efforts to comply
    with these new regulations have resulted in, and are likely to
    continue resulting in, increased general and administrative
    expenses and diversion of management time and attention from
    revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.

We have recently completed our evaluation of our internal
    controls over financial reporting as required by
    Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Although our
    assessment, testing, and evaluation resulted in our conclusion
    that as of April 27, 2007, our internal controls over
    financial reporting were effective, we cannot predict the
    outcome of our testing in future periods. If our internal
    controls are ineffective in future periods, our business and
    reputation could be harmed. We may incur additional expenses and
    commitment of management’s time in connection with further
    evaluations, either of which could materially increase our
    operating expenses and accordingly reduce our net income.

Because new and modified laws, regulations, and standards are
    subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their
    lack of specificity, their application in practice may evolve
    over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and
    governing bodies. This evolution may result in continuing
    uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs
    necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and
    governance practices.

Our
    ability to forecast earnings is limited by the impact of new
    accounting requirements such as
    SFAS No. 123R.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board requires companies to
    recognize the fair value of stock options and other share-based
    payment compensation to employees as compensation expense in the
    statement of income. Option pricing models require the input of
    highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock
    price volatility, expected life, and forfeiture rate. We have
    chosen to base our estimate of future volatility using the
    implied volatility of traded options to purchase the
    Company’s common stock as permitted by
    SAB No. 107. As of April 29, 2006, the
    contractual life of our stock options was shortened to seven
    years from ten years for options issued on or after this date,
    and to the extent that the shorter life changes employees’
    exercise behavior, it may change the expected term of an option
    going forward. SFAS No. 123R requires us to use
    estimated forfeitures, and therefore the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R could have a material impact on the
    timing of and, based on the accuracy of estimates of future
    actual forfeitures, the amount of stock-based compensation
    expense. Given the unpredictable nature of the “Black
    Scholes” variables and other management assumptions such as
    number of options to be granted, underlying strike price, and
    associated income tax impacts, it is very difficult to estimate
    stock-based compensation expense for any given quarter or year.
    Any changes in these highly subjective assumptions may
    significantly impact our ability to make accurate forecasts of
    future earnings and volatility of our stock price. If another
    party asserts that the fair value of our employee stock options
    is misstated, securities class action litigation could be
    brought against us, or the market price of our common stock
    could decline, or both could occur. As a result, we could incur
    significant losses, and our operating results may be below our
    expectations and those of investors and stock market analysts.

The
    U.S. government has contributed to our revenue growth and has
    become an important customer for us.

The U.S. government has become an important customer for
    the storage market and for us; however, government demand is
    unpredictable, and there is no guarantee of future revenue
    growth from the U.S. government. Government agencies are
    subject to budgetary processes and expenditure constraints that
    could lead to delays or decreased capital expenditures in IT
    spending on infrastructures. If the government or individual
    agencies within the government reduce or shift their capital
    spending pattern, our financial results may be harmed. We cannot
    assure you that revenue from the U.S. government will
    continue to grow in the future.



The General Services Administration (“GSA”) is
    currently auditing our records under the schedule contracts it
    had with us to verify our compliance with various contract
    provisions. If the audit determines that we did not comply with
    such provisions, we may be required to pay the GSA a potential
    settlement. The exact date for completion of the audit and the
    subsequent negotiation process is unknown and may not be
    concluded for some time. Our management does not believe, based
    upon information currently known to us that the final resolution
    of our audit will have a material adverse effect upon our
    consolidated financial position and the results of operations
    and cash flows.

Properties

Our headquarters site for corporate general administration,
    sales and marketing, research and development, global services,
    and manufacturing operations is located in Sunnyvale,
    California. We own and occupy approximately 800,000 square
    feet of space in buildings at our Sunnyvale headquarters.

We have commitments related to two lease arrangements with BNP
    Paribas LLC (“BNP”) for approximately
    380,000 square feet of office space to be located on land
    currently owned by us in Sunnyvale, California (as further
    described below under “Contractual Cash Obligations and
    Other Commercial Commitments”). We expect to pay lease
    payments on the first lease in October 2007 for a term of five
    years, and the second lease in September 2008 for a term of five
    years. We have the option to renew both leases for two
    consecutive five-year periods upon approval by BNP.

We lease other sales offices and research and development
    facilities throughout the U.S. and internationally. We
    expect that our existing facilities and those being developed in
    Sunnyvale, California; RTP, North Carolina; and worldwide are
    adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years
    and that additional space will be available as needed.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation

    expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will
    have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion of our financial condition and results
    of operations should be read together with the financial
    statements and the related notes set forth under
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data.” The following discussion also contains trend
    information and other forward looking statements that involve a
    number of risks and uncertainties. The Risk Factors set forth in
    “Item 1. Business” are hereby incorporated into
    the discussion by reference.

Overview

Enterprises are generating vast quantities of data. We are
    experiencing a worldwide data explosion, driven by rapid growth
    of broadband Internet access, the proliferation of data devices,
    and the need to protect critical data through replication, the
    “digital footprints” of everyday life are growing
    exponentially. As the volume of data grows, so does the
    complexity of data storage and management. Data ownership and
    the burdens of managing data continue to challenge our
    enterprise customers. Data growth, greater global demands on
    data access, more complex legal requirements, increasing
    consequences for data outages, and greater data longevity all
    contribute to the growing burden of responsibility on IT
    professionals. In response, CIOs and IT professionals are
    looking for solutions to help simplify data storage, IT
    administration, improve the capabilities of storage systems and
    reduce total costs of ownership. Companies are migrating toward
    modular, unified storage systems away from large, fixed,
    expensive, frame-class arrays and inefficient direct-attached
    storage. There is a growing trend toward consolidating storage
    and serving a variety of applications from a unified storage
    pool.

We believe that our strategic investments are targeted at some
    of the strongest growth areas of the storage market, such as
    modular storage, archive and compliance, data protection, data
    classification, data discovery, data migration, data permanence,
    data security and privacy, iSCSI, and grid computing. However,
    if any storage market



trends and emerging standards on which we are basing our
    assumptions do not materialize as anticipated, our business
    could be materially adversely affected.

In fiscal 2007, despite continuous downward pricing pressures
    and competitive environments, our revenue continued to grow
    faster than that of our competitors. We expect to continue to
    experience price declines per petabyte for our hardware
    products, which may have an adverse impact on our future gross
    margins if not offset by a product mix with higher software
    content and higher average selling prices associated with new
    products. At the same time, we also expect our future gross
    margins may be negatively affected by factors such as global
    service investment cost, competition, indirect sales including
    OEM, and high disk content, partially offset by new product
    introductions and add-on software mix.

While we reported solid fiscal 2007 results with a 36% annual
    revenue growth, we were not immune to the macroeconomic spending
    slowdown in the U.S. Our fourth quarter fiscal 2007
    bookings were back-end loaded and finished lower than our
    forecast. In addition, in the last two weeks of the fourth
    quarter in fiscal 2007, we experienced a shift in the mix of our
    bookings toward more deferred elements. As a result, we did not
    build our normal levels of non-deferred backlog at the end of
    the fourth quarter, which will impact the first quarter of
    fiscal 2008. Without the benefit of normal backlog, we do not
    expect our usual level of growth in first quarter revenue, and
    as a result, our expense levels as a percentage of our revenue
    will be above our targeted business model. We will slow our rate
    of hiring and investment spending in order to return to our
    targeted business model. Given the lack of growth in our
    non-deferred backlog, we lowered our forecasts for the first
    quarter of fiscal 2008 in revenues, operating margins and
    earnings.

Although we are faced with a first quarter that does not have
    the benefit of typical backlog levels, we believe our business
    fundamentals remain intact. We remain confident in the
    competitiveness of our products and in our ability to grow our
    business over the long term. We continue to make progress across
    many areas of the organization, including broadening and
    enhancing our enterprise solutions, supporting our
    channel/partners, and deepening our professional services
    coverage. We believe our products continue to offer the best
    price-performance value in the industry, and we further extended
    our ability to help customers do “more with less” with
    new product introductions.

Fiscal
    2007 Highlights

Our fiscal 2007 revenue grew year over year, and the increase
    was across all major products categories and geographies. The
    net increase in revenues was attributable to increased software
    licenses, software upgrade and maintenance arrangements,
    increased service revenue, an expanded portfolio with new
    products and solutions for the enterprise customers, and was
    partially offset by lower

cost-per-megabyte

disks, and a decline in shipments and lower average selling
    prices of our older generation products. Some of the key fiscal
    2007 highlights included:

Increased our penetration into enterprise data centers and
    enhanced data management and data protection
    solutions.

From a product perspective, we
    continued to enhance our data management and data protection
    portfolios with a key acquisition and several product
    introductions. We extended our data center portfolio with
    several additions including new midrange and high-end platforms,
    broader Fibre Channel storage area network capabilities,
    significant enhancements in the NetApp Manageability Software
    Family, and new professional services, all aimed at making
    enterprise data center management easier for customers who
    demand high-performance SAN solutions and increased application
    uptime to meet their business needs. We anticipate the SAN
    competitiveness of our new midrange, along with the strength of
    our high-end SAN-configured systems, to continue to contribute
    to an increase in the block-based protocols component of our
    business. We also continued to gain momentum in the SAN market
    while maintaining market leadership in both network-attached
    storage and iSCSI.

Extended our channel/partner opportunities.

We
    continued to make progress in penetrating and expanding our
    business in enterprise data centers with mission-critical
    partners. Our fiscal 2007 channel mix demonstrated increased
    expansion through our partner programs, with approximately 59.6%
    of our business coming through indirect channels and the
    remaining 40.4% coming through direct sales. Higher growth rates
    in our indirect channels demonstrated our increasing leverage,
    giving us broader market reach and increasing enterprise
    penetration.



Expanded our global services and support.

It
    is an element of our strategy to expand and offer a global,
    comprehensive, end-to-end suite of world-class service and
    support solutions designed to help our customers meet their
    goals of simplifying their storage solutions. We increased our
    business with our top enterprise customers, who typically
    purchase more complete and longer-term service packages. The
    growth in service revenue in fiscal 2007 was also driven by
    increases in professional services. We plan to continue to
    invest in our global services and support and believe that such
    investments will help accelerate the adoption rate of our
    technology. We cannot assure you that service revenue will
    continue to grow at previous rates.

Broadened our total addressable market and extended our
    product lines into adjacent spaces.

We have
    brought a more comprehensive set of products to the market place
    with the new high-end offering our next-generation scale-out
    operating system with enhanced storage grid functionality, the
    disk-to-disk backup solution in the VTL space, and our entry
    into the small to medium-sized business market. We also
    continued to broaden our addressable market by increasing our
    focus on the V-Series product line, which uses virtualization to
    let customers take advantage of the management simplicity of
    NetApp Data ONTAP in front of their storage from other vendors.
    Our acquisition of Topio in December 2006 will also help us
    expand our heterogeneous data protection portfolio as part of
    our plan to broaden our total addressable market.

Fiscal
    2007 Financial Performance

•

Our revenues for fiscal 2007 were $2.8 billion, a 35.7%
    increase over the same period a year ago. Our revenues for
    fiscal 2006 were $2.1 billion, a 29.3% increase compared to
    revenues of $1.6 billion in fiscal 2005. Our revenue growth
    was driven by the adoption of our products and solutions
    targeted at the areas of fastest growth in storage, secondary
    storage for compliance applications, and our broadened NetApp
    storage solutions that simplify data management.

•

Our overall gross margins were 60.8%, 60.8%, and 61.0% in fiscal
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The gross margins remained
    relatively flat for both fiscal 2007 and 2006, reflecting
    increased software upgrade and maintenance arrangements and
    improved service margins, offset by lower margins from our OEM
    business. The slight decline in our overall gross margins for
    fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a shift
    in revenue mix toward services, with an increase in our OEM
    business partially offset by improved service gross margins.

•

In fiscal 2007, we generated $864.5 million of cash from
    operating activities as compared to $554.3 million in
    fiscal 2006. As of April 27, 2007, our cash, cash
    equivalents and short-term investments decreased slightly to
    $1,308.8 million, compared to $1,322.9 million as of
    April 28, 2006. This decrease was due primarily to
    $805.7 million used to repurchase our common stock and net
    cash paid of $131.2 million in connection with the Topio
    acquisition, partially offset by $864.5 million generated
    from operations and $23.9 million received from the sale of
    certain NetCache assets. Our deferred revenue balance increased
    to $1,103.0 million in fiscal 2007 from $681.5 million
    reported in fiscal 2006, due to higher software upgrade and
    maintenance arrangements and service arrangements attributable
    to our continuing shift toward larger enterprise customers who
    tend to purchase more comprehensive and longer term
    arrangements. Capital purchases of plant, property, and
    equipment for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were
    $165.8 million, $132.9 million, and
    $93.6 million, respectively, reflecting continued worldwide
    capital investment to meet our business growth.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates and Policies

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
    of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial
    Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. The preparation of such statements requires us to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the
    financial statements. Our estimates are based on historical
    experience and other assumptions that we consider to be
    appropriate in the circumstances. However, actual future results
    may vary from our estimates.



We believe that the following accounting policies are
    “critical” as defined by the Securities and Exchange
    Commission, in that they are both highly important to the
    portrayal of our financial condition and results and require
    difficult management judgments and assumptions about matters
    that are inherently uncertain. We also have other important
    policies, including those related to derivative instruments and
    concentration of credit risk. However, these policies do not
    meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they
    do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that
    are difficult or subjective. These policies are discussed in
    Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    accompanying this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We believe the accounting policies described below are the ones
    that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments
    and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results
    of operations:

•

Revenue recognition and allowances

•

Valuation of goodwill and intangibles

•

Accounting for income taxes

•

Inventory write-downs

•

Restructuring accruals

•

Impairment losses on investments

•

Accounting for stock-based compensation

•

Loss contingencies

Revenue
    Recognition and Allowances

We apply the provisions of Statement of Position
    (“SOP”)

No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

(SOP No. 97-2),

and related interpretations to our product sales, both hardware
    and software, because our software is essential to the
    performance of our hardware. We recognize revenue when:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists:

It is our customary practice to have a
    purchase order

and/or

contract prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement from our
    end users, customers, value-added resellers, or distributors.

•

Delivery has occurred:

Our product is
    physically delivered to our customers, generally with standard
    transfer terms such as FOB origin. We typically do not allow for
    restocking rights with any of our value-added resellers or
    distributors. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or
    return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria
    are achieved. If undelivered products or services exist that are
    essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an
    arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred.

•

The fee is fixed or determinable:

Arrangements
    with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms,
    conditions and practices are not considered to be fixed or
    determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized as
    the fees become due and payable. We typically do not allow for
    price-protection rights with any of our value-added resellers or
    distributors.

•

Collection is probable:

Probability of
    collection is assessed on a

customer-by-customer

basis. Customers are subjected to a credit review process that
    evaluates the customers’ financial position and ultimately
    their ability to pay. If it is determined at the outset of an
    arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our
    review process, revenue is recognized upon cash receipt.

Our multiple element arrangements include our systems and
    generally may also include one or more of the following
    undelivered software-related elements: software upgrade and
    maintenance arrangements, premium hardware maintenance, and
    storage review services. Our software upgrade and maintenance
    arrangements entitle our customers to receive unspecified
    product upgrades and enhancements on a

when-and-if-available

basis, bug fixes, and patch releases. Premium hardware
    maintenance services include contracts for technical support and
    minimum response times. Revenues from software upgrade and
    maintenance arrangements, premium hardware maintenance services
    and storage review services are recognized ratably over the
    contractual term, generally from



one to three years. Standard hardware warranty costs are
    considered an obligation under SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

and expensed as a cost of
    service when revenue is recognized. We also offer extended
    service contracts (which extend our standard parts warranty and
    may include premium hardware maintenance) at the end of the
    warranty term; revenues from these contracts are recognized
    ratably over the contract term. We typically sell technical
    consulting services separately from any of our other revenue
    elements, either on a time and materials basis or for fixed
    price standard projects; we recognize revenue for these services
    as they are performed. Revenue from hardware installation
    services is recognized at the time of delivery and any remaining
    costs are accrued, as the remaining undelivered services are
    considered to be inconsequential and perfunctory. For
    arrangements with multiple elements, we recognize as revenue the
    difference between the total arrangement price and the greater
    of fair value or stated price for any undelivered elements
    (“the residual method”).

For our undelivered software-related elements, we apply the
    provisions of

SOP No. 97-2

and determine fair value of these undelivered elements based on
    vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”), which for
    us consists of the prices charged when these services are sold
    separately either alone, in the case of software upgrade and
    maintenance arrangements, or as a bundled element which always
    includes software upgrade and maintenance arrangements and
    premium hardware maintenance, and may also include storage
    review services. To determine the fair value of these elements,
    we analyze both the selling prices when elements are sold
    separately as well as the concentrations of those prices. We
    believe those concentrations have been sufficient to enable us
    to establish VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements. If
    VSOE cannot be obtained to establish fair value of the
    undelivered elements, paragraph 12 of

SOP 97-2

would require that revenue from the entire arrangement be
    initially deferred and recognized ratably over the period these
    elements are delivered.

For income statement presentation purposes, once fair value has
    been determined for our undelivered bundled elements, we
    allocate revenue first to software upgrade and maintenance
    arrangements based on VSOE of its separate fair value, and then
    the residual is allocated to other service revenues.

We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at
    the time of shipment. Sales returns are estimated based on
    historical sales returns, current trends, and our expectations
    regarding future experience. We monitor and analyze the accuracy
    of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and
    adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of
    our current and future reserve needs. Our reserve levels have
    been sufficient to cover actual returns and have not required
    material changes in subsequent periods. While we currently have
    no expectations for significant changes to these reserves, if
    actual future returns and allowances differ from past
    experience, additional allowances may be required.

We also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for
    estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility
    of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts
    receivable. We analyze accounts receivable and historical bad
    debts, customer concentrations, customer solvency, current
    economic and geographic trends, and changes in customer payment
    terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of current and
    future allowance. In circumstances where we are aware of a
    specific customer’s inability to meet its financial
    obligations to us, a specific allowance for bad debt is
    estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable
    to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected.
    We monitor and analyze the accuracy of allowance for doubtful
    accounts estimate by reviewing past collectibility and adjust it
    for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current
    and future allowance. Our reserve levels have generally been
    sufficient to cover credit losses. Our allowance for doubtful
    accounts as of April 27, 2007 was $2.6 million,
    compared to $2.4 million as of April 28, 2006. During
    the year ended April 28, 2006, we reduced our reserve by
    $1.5 million due to overall improvement in our collections
    history. However, if the financial condition of our customers
    were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability
    to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

Valuation
    of Goodwill and Intangibles

Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over time, while
    in-process research and development is recorded as a charge on
    the date of acquisition and goodwill is capitalized, subject to
    periodic review for impairment. Accordingly, the allocation of
    the acquisition cost to identifiable intangible assets has a
    significant impact on our future operating results. The
    allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and
    assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows expected
    to be generated by the acquired assets. Should conditions be
    different than



management’s current assessment, material write-downs of
    the fair value of intangible assets may be required. We
    periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our
    other intangible assets. In addition, a reduction in the
    estimate of remaining useful life could result in accelerated
    amortization expense or a write-down in future periods. As such,
    any future write-downs of these assets would adversely affect
    our gross and operating margins. We currently do not foresee
    changes to useful lives or write-downs to these assets.

Under our accounting policy we perform an annual review in the
    fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators
    of impairment exist. Triggering events for impairment reviews
    may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends,
    restructuring actions, lower projections of profitability, or a
    sustained decline in our market capitalization. Evaluations of
    possible impairment and, if applicable, adjustments to carrying
    values require us to estimate, among other factors, future cash
    flows, useful lives, and fair market values of our reporting
    units and assets. When we conduct our evaluation of goodwill,
    the fair value of goodwill is assessed using valuation
    techniques that require significant management judgment. Should
    conditions be different from management’s last assessment,
    significant write-downs of goodwill may be required. In fiscal
    2007 we performed such evaluation and found no impairment.
    However, any future write-downs of goodwill would adversely
    affect our operating margins. As of April 27, 2007, our
    assets included $601.1 million in goodwill. See
    Note 14, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible
    Assets,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

During fiscal 2007, we recorded goodwill of $114.7 million
    in connection with our Topio acquisition and a reduction of
    goodwill for $1.2 million in connection with the
    divestiture of certain NetCache assets.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

The determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments
    and estimates due to the complexity of the tax law that we are
    subject to in several tax jurisdictions. Earnings derived from
    our international business are generally taxed at rates that are
    lower than U.S. rates, resulting in a lower effective tax
    rate than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0%. The ability
    to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent upon
    existing tax laws in both the U.S. and the respective
    countries in which our international subsidiaries are located.
    Future changes in domestic or international tax laws could
    affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are
    currently receiving. In addition, a decrease in the percentage
    of our total earnings from our international business or a
    change in the mix of international business among particular tax
    jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate.

We account for income taxes in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income
    Taxes.”

SFAS No. 109 requires that deferred
    tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of
    temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
    used for income tax purposes. SFAS No. 109 also
    requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation
    allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the
    deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have provided a
    valuation allowance of $21.0 million as of April 27,
    2007, compared to $431.2 million as of April 28, 2006
    on certain of our deferred tax assets. We adopted
    SFAS No. 123R effective the beginning of our fiscal
    year ended April 27, 2007. Under SFAS No. 123R,
    tax attributes related to the exercise of employee stock options
    should not be realized until they result in a reduction of taxes
    payable. Pursuant to Footnote 82 of SFAS No. 123R, on
    a prospective basis we no longer include unrealized stock option
    attributes as components of our gross deferred tax assets and
    corresponding valuation allowance disclosures. The tax effected
    amounts of gross unrealized net operating loss and business tax
    credit carryforwards, and their corresponding valuation
    allowance excluded under Footnote 82 for the year ended
    April 27, 2007 are $363.3 million. The valuation
    allowance at April 28, 2006 related to net operating loss
    carryforwards, conditional royalty carryforwards, and tax credit
    carryforwards attributable to the exercise of employee stock
    options.

We are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the
    U.S. and several foreign tax jurisdictions. The rights to
    some of our intellectual property (“IP”) are owned by
    certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made
    between foreign and U.S. tax jurisdictions relating to the
    use of this IP. Recently, some other companies have had their
    foreign IP arrangements challenged as part of an examination.
    Our management does not believe, based upon information
    currently known to us that the final resolution of any of our
    audits will have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated
    financial position and the results of operations and cash flows.
    However, if upon the conclusion of these audits the ultimate
    determination of our taxes owed in any of these tax
    jurisdictions is for an



amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or
    reserved for, our overall effective tax rate may be adversely
    impacted in the period of adjustment.

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes —
    an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”

(FIN No. 48). FIN No. 48 prescribes a
    comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure,
    present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax
    positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on a tax
    return (including a decision whether to file or not to file a
    return in a particular jurisdiction). FIN No. 48 is
    applicable to all uncertain tax positions for taxes accounted
    for under FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income
    Taxes

(SFAS No. 109), and substantially changes
    the applicable accounting model. We are required to adopt
    FIN No. 48 for our fiscal year beginning
    April 28, 2007. We are currently evaluating the effect that
    the adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on our
    consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

Inventory
    Write-Downs

Our net inventory balance was $54.9 million as of
    April 27, 2007, compared to $64.5 million as of
    April 28, 2006. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out basis) or market. We perform an in-depth excess and
    obsolete analysis of our inventory based upon assumptions about
    future demand and market conditions. We adjust the inventory
    value based on estimated excess and obsolete inventories
    determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Although we
    strive for accuracy in our forecasts of future product demand,
    any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological
    developments could have a significant impact on the value of our
    inventory and commitments and on our reported results. If actual
    market conditions are less favorable than those projected,
    additional write-downs and other charges against earnings may be
    required. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may
    realize higher gross margins in the period when the written-down
    inventory is sold. During the past few years, our inventory
    reserves have generally been sufficient to cover excess and
    obsolete exposure and have not required material changes in
    subsequent periods.

We record purchase commitment liabilities with our contract
    manufacturers and suppliers as a result of changes in demand
    forecasts or as we transition our products. As of April 27,
    2007 and April 28, 2006, we did not have purchase
    commitment liabilities under such arrangements.

We engage in extensive, ongoing product quality programs and
    processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the
    quality of our component suppliers. We also provide for the
    estimated cost of known product failures based on known quality
    issues when they arise. Should actual cost of product failure
    differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated liability
    would be required.

We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and
    foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage,
    discharge, and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our
    manufacturing process or requiring design changes or recycling
    of products we manufacture. We will continue to monitor our
    environmental compliance and could incur higher costs, including
    additional reserves for excess component inventory.

Restructuring
    Accruals

In fiscal 2002, as a result of continuing unfavorable economic
    conditions and a reduction in IT spending rates, we implemented
    two restructuring plans, which included reductions in our
    workforce and a consolidation of our facilities. In fiscal 2006,
    we implemented the third restructuring plan related to the move
    of our global service center operations. In determining
    restructuring charges, we analyze our future business
    requirements in order to properly align and manage our business
    commensurate with our future revenue levels.

Our restructuring costs, and any resulting accruals, involve
    significant estimates made by management using the best
    information available at the time the estimates are made, some
    of which may be provided by third parties. In recording
    severance reserves, we accrue a liability when the following
    conditions have been met: employees’ rights to receive
    compensation are attributable to employees’ services
    already rendered, the obligation relates to rights that vest or
    accumulate, payment of the compensation is probable, and the
    amount can be reasonably estimated. In recording the facilities
    lease restructuring reserve, we make various assumptions,
    including the time period over



which the facilities are expected to be vacant, expected
    sublease terms, expected sublease rates, anticipated future
    operating expenses, and expected future use of the facilities.

Our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some
    of which are beyond our control, including future real estate
    market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into
    subleases or lease termination agreements with terms as
    favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates. We
    regularly evaluate a number of factors to determine the
    appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring and
    lease loss accruals, including the various assumptions noted
    above. If actual results differ significantly from our
    estimates, we may be required to adjust our restructuring and
    lease loss accruals in the future. We estimated our facility and
    severance restructuring reserve to be $2.1 million as of
    April 27, 2007. Our fiscal 2006 facility restructuring
    reserve included a $1.0 million reduction related to the
    execution of a new sublease agreement for our Tewksbury facility
    net of related costs.

Impairment
    Losses on Investments

As of April 27, 2007, our short-term investments have been
    classified as “available-for-sale” and are carried at
    fair value. There have been no significant declines in fair
    value of investments that are considered to be
    other-than-temporary for any of the three years in the period
    ended April 27, 2007. The fair value of our
    available-for-sale investments reflected in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets were $935.7 million and
    $1,102.8 million as of April 27, 2007 and
    April 28, 2006, respectively. Included in these balances
    were short-term restricted investments of $116.0 million,
    as of April 27, 2007, and short-term and long-term
    restricted investments of $136.7 million and
    $104.4 million, respectively, as of April 28, 2006. In
    addition, our available-for-sale investments also included an
    investment in a publicly held company of $12.9 million,
    which was based on quoted market prices on April 27, 2007.
    We had no investments in publicly held companies as of
    April 28, 2006. We have not identified any of these
    declines to be other-than-temporary, as market declines of our
    investments have been caused by interest rate changes and were
    not due to credit-worthiness. Because we have the ability and
    intent to hold these investments until maturity, we would not
    expect any significant decline in value of our investments
    caused by market interest rate changes.

All of our available-for-sale investments and nonmarketable
    securities are subject to a periodic impairment review.
    Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair
    value is judged to be other-than-temporary. This determination
    requires significant judgment. For publicly traded investments,
    impairment is determined based upon the specific facts and
    circumstances present at the time, including factors such as
    current economic and market conditions, the credit rating of the
    security’s issuer, the length of time an investment’s
    fair value has been below our carrying value, and our ability
    and intent to hold investments to maturity. If an
    investment’s decline in fair value, caused by factors other
    than changes in interest rates, is deemed to be
    other-than-temporary, we would reduce its carrying value to its
    estimated fair value, as determined based on quoted market
    prices or liquidation values. For investments in publicly held
    companies, we recognize an impairment charge when the declines
    in the fair values of our investments in these companies are
    below their cost basis are judged to be other-than-temporary.
    The ultimate value realized on these investments in publicly
    held companies is subject to market price volatility until they
    are sold. We have no impairment losses on our available-for-sale
    investments for fiscal 2007 and 2006.

For nonmarketable securities, the impairment analysis requires
    the identification of events or circumstances that would likely
    have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the
    investment, including, revenue and earnings trends, overall
    business prospects, limited capital resources, limited prospects
    of receiving additional financing, limited prospects for
    liquidity of the related securities, and general market
    conditions in the investees’ industry. Our investments in
    privately-held companies were $8.9 million and
    $11.0 million as of April 27, 2007 and April 28,
    2006, respectively. During fiscal 2007, we recorded impairment
    of $2.1 million for investments in privately-held
    companies. We had no impairment losses on our investments in
    privately-held companies in fiscal 2006.

Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation

We adopted SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

,
    using the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our
    employee stock options. The fair value of each option grant is
    estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes



option pricing model and is not remeasured as a result of
    subsequent stock price fluctuations. Option pricing models
    require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including
    the expected stock price volatility, expected life, and
    forfeiture rate. We have chosen to base our estimate of future
    volatility using the implied volatility of traded options to
    purchase the Company’s common stock as permitted by Staff
    Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107. As of
    April 29, 2006, the contractual life of our stock options
    was shortened to seven years from ten years for options issued
    on or after this date, and to the extent that the shorter life
    changes employees’ exercise behavior, it may change the
    expected term of an option going forward.
    SFAS No. 123R requires us to use estimated
    forfeitures, and therefore the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R could have a material impact on the
    timing of and, based on the accuracy of estimates of future
    actual forfeitures, the amount of stock-based compensation
    expense. Any changes in these highly subjective assumptions may
    significantly impact the stock-based compensation expense for
    the future. Likewise, the shortening of the contractual life of
    our options could change the estimated exercise behavior in a
    manner other than currently expected.

Loss
    Contingencies

We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies
    arising in the course of business. We consider the likelihood of
    the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a
    liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the
    amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated
    loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability
    has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount
    of loss can be reasonably estimated. In fiscal 2007, 2006, and
    2005, we did not identify or accrue for any loss contingencies.
    We regularly evaluate current information available to us to
    determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.

New
    Accounting Standards

In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 159,

The Fair Value
    Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115.

SFAS No. 159 allows measurement at
    fair value of eligible financial assets and liabilities that are
    not otherwise measured at fair value. If the fair value option
    for an eligible item is elected, unrealized gains and losses for
    that item shall be reported in current earnings at each
    subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 also
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
    draw comparison between the different measurement attributes the
    company elects for similar types of assets and liabilities. This
    statement is effective for our fiscal year beginning
    April 27, 2008. We are currently evaluating the effect, if
    any, that the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on
    our consolidated financial statements

In September, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements.

SFAS No. 157 provides a framework
    for measuring fair value, clarifies the definition of fair
    value, and expands disclosures regarding fair value
    measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new
    fair value measurements and eliminates inconsistencies in
    guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. We
    are required to adopt SFAS No. 157 for our fiscal year
    beginning April 27, 2008. We are currently evaluating the
    effect that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on
    our consolidated results of operations and financial condition,
    but do not expect it to have a material impact.

In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
    (“SAB”) No. 108,

Considering the Effects of
    Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
    Current Year Financial Statements.

SAB No. 108
    provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be
    taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in
    current year financial statements for purposes of determining
    whether the current year’s financial statements are
    materially misstated. SAB No. 108 is effective for
    fiscal years ending on or after November 15, 2006. We
    adopted SAB 108 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and
    its adoption did not have a material impact on our results of
    operations or financial condition.

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”)
    No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
    — an Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

. FIN No. 48 prescribes a
    comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure,
    present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax
    positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on a tax
    return (including a decision whether to file or not to file a
    return in a particular jurisdiction). FIN No. 48 is
    applicable to all uncertain tax



positions for taxes accounted for under FASB Statement
    No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(SFAS No. 109), and substantially changes the
    applicable accounting model. We are required to adopt
    FIN No. 48 for our fiscal year beginning
    April 28, 2007. We are currently evaluating the effect that
    the adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on our
    consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

Fiscal
    2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006

Product Revenues

— Product revenues increased
    by 32.2% to $2,085.9 million in fiscal 2007, from
    $1,577.4 million in fiscal 2006. Product revenues growth
    was across all geographies.



Product revenues were favorably affected by the following
    factors:

•

Increased revenues from our current product portfolio. Product
    revenue grew $686.9 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to
    fiscal 2006, with a $669.7 million increase due to unit
    volume and an increase of $17.2 million due to price and
    configuration on existing products. Price changes, volumes, and
    product model mix can have an effect on changes in product
    revenues; the impact on these forces is significantly affected
    by the configuration of systems shipped.

•

Units shipped of the FAS3000 enterprise storage systems
    increased 85.5% for fiscal 2007, compared to the prior fiscal
    year. The average capacity on revenue units of the FAS3000
    series increased 180.5% for fiscal 2007, compared to the prior
    fiscal year.

•

Increased sales through indirect channels in absolute dollars,
    including sales through our resellers, distributors, and OEM
    partners, represented 59.6% and 55.5% of total revenues for
    fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively.

•

Our petabytes shipped increased 107.7% year over year to a
    record 536 petabytes due to increased enterprise penetration in
    primary and secondary storage, i.e., enterprise data centers,
    data protection, disaster recovery, archival, and compliance
    requirements. This increase in petabytes shipped was
    attributable to an increase in petabytes from 500 gigabyte ATA
    drives. ATA drives accounted for 55.7% of our total petabytes
    shipped in fiscal 2007 compared to 47.1% in fiscal 2006. Fibre
    Channel petabytes were up 148.3% year over year, to 44.3% of our
    total shipped.

Product revenues were negatively affected by the following
    factors:

•

Price declines per petabyte for our hardware products as disks
    are a significant component of our storage systems. As
    performance has improved on our devices, the related price we
    can charge per petabyte of storage has decreased as well.

•

Revenues for our older products declined by $376.3 million
    in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to a 72.0%
    and a 63.3% decrease in revenue generated by FAS900 series
    systems and NearStore R200 systems, respectively. In addition,
    revenue also declined by $2.2 million in fiscal 2007
    compared to fiscal 2006 due to products that we no longer ship,
    including our NetCache products.

Our systems are highly configurable to respond to customer
    requirements in the open systems storage markets that we serve.
    As a result, the wide variation in customized configuration can
    significantly impact revenue, cost of revenues, and gross margin
    performance. Price changes, volumes, and product model mix can
    have an effect on changes in product revenues; the impact on
    these forces is significantly affected by the configuration of
    systems shipped.

Software Upgrade and Maintenance Arrangements
    Revenues

— Software upgrade and maintenance
    arrangements revenues increased by 42.7% to $341.3 million
    in fiscal 2007, from $239.1 million in fiscal 2006 due
    primarily to a larger installed base of customers who have
    purchased or renewed software upgrade and maintenance
    arrangements, and an increased number of new enterprise
    customers. Software upgrade and maintenance arrangements
    revenues represented 12.2% and 11.6% of total revenues for
    fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Service Revenues

— Service revenues, which
    include hardware support, professional services, and educational
    services, increased by 50.9% to $377.1 million in fiscal
    2007, from $249.9 million in fiscal 2006.

The increase in absolute dollars was due to the following
    factors:

•

Professional service revenue increased by 56.4% in fiscal 2007
    compared to fiscal 2006, due to an increasing number of
    enterprise customers, which typically have extremely complex IT
    environments and require professional services to integrate our
    solution into their environments.

•

Service maintenance contracts increased by 48.3% in fiscal 2007
    compared to fiscal 2006, due to a growing installed base,
    resulting in new customer support contracts in addition to
    support contract renewals by existing customers.



While it is an element of our strategy to expand and offer more
    comprehensive global enterprise support and service solutions,
    we cannot assure you that service revenue will grow at the
    current rate in fiscal 2008 or beyond.

A large portion of our service revenues is deferred and, in most
    cases, recognized ratably over the service obligation periods,
    which are typically one to three years. Service revenues
    represented 13.4% and 12.1% of total revenues for fiscal years
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

International total revenues

— International
    total revenues (including U.S. exports) increased by 32.9%
    in fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. International total
    revenues were $1,254.0 million, or 44.7% of total revenues
    for fiscal 2007, compared to $943.8 million, or 45.7% of
    total revenues for fiscal 2006. The increase in international
    sales was primarily driven by the same factors outlined under
    the Total Revenue discussion, as compared to the same periods in
    the prior fiscal year. We cannot assure you that we will be able
    to maintain or increase international revenues in fiscal 2008.

Product Gross Margins

— Product gross margins
    were 60.9% for both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006.

Product gross margins for both fiscal 2007 and 2006 were
    affected by the following factors:

•

SFAS 123R stock compensation expenses recorded in fiscal
    2007 and none in fiscal 2006

•

Sales price reductions due to competitive pricing pressure and
    selective pricing discounts

•

Increased sales through certain indirect channels, which
    generate lower gross margins than our direct sales in certain
    geographic regions

•

Higher disk content with an expanded storage capacity for the
    higher-end storage systems, as resale of disk drives generates
    lower gross margins

We expect higher disk content associated with high-end storage
    systems will negatively affect our gross margins in the future
    if not offset by increases in software revenue and new
    higher-margin products.

Stock-based compensation expense included in cost of product
    revenues was $3.7 million for fiscal 2007. Amortization of
    existing technology included in cost of product revenues was
    $17.6 million and $11.8 million for fiscal 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Estimated future amortization of existing
    technology to cost of product revenues will be
    $21.1 million for fiscal year 2008, $20.4 million for
    fiscal year 2009, $15.9 million for fiscal year 2010,
    $6.3 million for fiscal year 2011, and none thereafter.

Software Upgrade and Maintenance Arrangements Gross
    Margins

— Software upgrade and maintenance
    arrangements gross margins was 97.0% and 96.5% for fiscal 2007
    and 2006, respectively, due primarily to improved productivity
    and a larger installed base renewals, upgrades, and an
    increasing number of new enterprise customers.

Service Gross Margins

— Service gross margins
    increased to 27.4% in fiscal 2007 compared to 25.9% in fiscal
    2006. Cost of service revenue increased by 47.9% to
    $273.6 million in fiscal 2007, from $185.0 million in
    fiscal 2006. Stock-based compensation expense of
    $10.1 million was included in the cost of service revenue
    for fiscal 2007.

The change in service gross margins year over year was primarily
    impacted by an increase in services revenue, improved
    productivity, and continued spending in our service
    infrastructure to support our increasing enterprise customer
    base. This spending included additional professional support
    engineers, increased support center activities, and global
    service partnership programs. Service gross margins will
    typically be impacted by factors such as timing of technical
    support service initiations and renewals and additional
    investments in our customer support infrastructure. In fiscal
    2008, we expect service margins to experience some variability
    over time as we continue to build out our service capability and
    capacity to support our growing enterprise customers and new
    products.

Sales and Marketing

— Sales and marketing
    expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions, advertising
    and promotional expenses, stock-based compensation expense, and
    certain customer service and support costs. Sales and marketing
    expenses increased 49.5% to $895.8 million for fiscal 2007,
    from $599.1 million for fiscal 2006. These expenses were
    32.0% and 28.9% of total revenues for fiscal 2007 and fiscal
    2006, respectively. The



increase in absolute dollars was attributed to increased
    commission expenses resulting from increased revenues, higher
    performance-based payroll expenses due to higher profitability,
    higher partner program expenses, the continued worldwide
    investment in our sales and global service organizations
    associated with selling complete enterprise solutions, and
    stock-based compensation expenses recognized under adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R.

The stock-based compensation expenses included in sales and
    marketing expenses for fiscal 2007 was $71.7 million
    compared to $4.0 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in
    stock-based compensation was due to adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R. Amortization of acquisitions-related
    trademarks/tradenames and customer contracts and relationships
    included in sales and marketing expenses was $2.9 million
    and $2.1 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006,
    respectively. Based on identified intangibles related to our
    acquisitions recorded at April 27, 2007, estimated future
    amortization such as trademarks and customer relationships
    included in sales and marketing expenses will be
    $3.9 million for fiscal 2008, $3.8 million for fiscal
    2009, $3.7 million for fiscal 2010, $2.7 million for
    fiscal 2011, $1.6 million for fiscal 2012, and
    $0.9 million thereafter.

We expect to continue to selectively add sales capacity in an
    effort to expand domestic and international markets, introduce
    new products, and establish and expand new distribution
    channels. We expect to increase our sales and marketing expenses
    commensurate with future revenue growth.

Research and Development

— Research and
    development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits,
    stock-based compensation, prototype expenses, nonrecurring
    engineering charges, fees paid to outside consultants, and
    amortization of capitalized patents.

Research and development expenses increased 53.3% to
    $385.4 million for fiscal 2007 from $251.3 million for
    fiscal 2006. These expenses represented 13.7% and 12.2% of total
    revenues for fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in
    research and development expenses was primarily a result of
    increased headcount, ongoing operating impact of the
    acquisitions, ongoing support of current and future product
    development and enhancement efforts, higher performance-based
    payroll expenses due to higher profitability, and stock-based
    compensation expense recognized under adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R. For both fiscal 2007 and 2006, no
    software development costs were capitalized.

The stock-based compensation expenses included in research and
    development expenses for fiscal 2007 was $51.3 million
    compared to $8.3 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in
    stock-based compensation was due to adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R. Included in research and development
    expenses are capitalized patents amortization of
    $2.0 million and $2.0 million for fiscal 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Based on capitalized patents recorded at
    April 27, 2007, estimated future capitalized patents
    amortization expenses will be $2.0 million for fiscal year
    2008, $0.5 million in fiscal 2009, $0.2 million in
    fiscal 2010, and none thereafter.

We believe that our future performance will depend in large part
    on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line,
    develop new products that achieve market acceptance, maintain
    technological competitiveness, and meet an expanding range of
    customer requirements. We expect to continuously support current
    and future product development and enhancement efforts and to
    incur prototyping expenses and nonrecurring engineering charges
    associated with the development of new products and
    technologies. We intend to continuously broaden our existing
    product offerings and to introduce new products that expand our
    solutions portfolio.

We believe that our research and development expenses will
    increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2008, primarily due to
    ongoing costs associated with the development of new products
    and technologies, increased headcount, and the operating impact
    of potential future acquisitions.

General and Administrative

— General and
    administrative expenses increased 58.9% to $147.5 million
    for fiscal 2007, from $92.8 million for fiscal 2006. These
    expenses represented 5.3% and 4.6% of total revenues for fiscal
    2007 and 2006, respectively. This increase in absolute dollars
    was primarily due to higher performance-based payroll expenses
    due to higher profitability and increased headcount, higher
    stock-based compensation expense recognized under
    SFAS No. 123R, and higher legal expenses and
    professional fees for general corporate matters.

We believe that our general and administrative expenses will
    increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2008 due to increased
    general and administrative headcount. The stock-based
    compensation expenses included in general and administrative
    expenses for fiscal 2007 was $26.2 million compared to
    $1.0 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in



stock-based compensation was due to adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R. Amortization of covenants not to
    compete included in general and administrative expenses was
    $1.0 million and $2.2 million for fiscal 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Based on identified intangibles related to
    our acquisitions recorded at January 26, 2007, estimated
    future amortization of covenants not to compete relating to our
    acquisitions will be $0.2 million for fiscal year 2008, and
    none thereafter.

Restructuring Charges

— In fiscal 2002, as a
    result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a
    reduction in information technology (“IT”) spending
    rates, we implemented two restructuring plans, which included
    reductions in our workforce and consolidations of our
    facilities. As of April 27, 2007, we have no outstanding
    balance in our restructuring liability for the first
    restructuring. The second restructuring related to the closure
    of an engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the
    Sunnyvale headquarters. In fiscal 2006, we implemented a third
    restructuring plan related to the move of our global services
    center operations from Sunnyvale to our new flagship support
    center at our Research Triangle Park facility in North Carolina.

Our restructuring estimates are reviewed and revised
    periodically and may result in a substantial charge or reduction
    to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail
    than were anticipated in previous management estimates. Such
    estimates included various assumptions such as the time period
    over which the facilities will be vacant, expected sublease
    terms, and expected sublease rates. In fiscal 2007, we did not
    record any reduction in restructuring reserve resulting from a
    change in estimate for our third restructuring plan. In fiscal
    2006, we recorded a reduction in restructuring reserve of
    $1.3 million resulting from the execution of a new sublease
    agreement for our Tewksbury facility. In fiscal 2006, we also
    recorded a restructuring charge of $1.1 million, primarily
    attributed to severance-related amounts and relocation expenses
    related to the third restructuring plan.

Of the reserve balance at April 27, 2007, $0.5 million
    was included in other accrued liabilities, and the remaining
    $1.6 million was classified as long-term obligations. The
    balance of the reserve is expected to be paid by fiscal 2011.

The following analysis sets forth the significant components of
    the restructuring reserve at April 27, 2007 (in thousands):

Gain on Sale of Assets

— We recorded a gain of
    $25.3 million in fiscal 2007 as a result of the sale of
    certain assets to Blue Coat Systems, Inc (“Blue
    Coat”). (see Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial
    Statements). We recorded revenues of $57.4 million,
    $71.1 million and $75.5 million from NetCache products
    for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 respectively. The contribution
    to operating income from these products was not significant.

Interest Income

— Interest income was
    $68.8 million and $41.5 million for fiscal 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The increase in interest income was
    primarily driven by higher average interest rates on our
    investment portfolio. We expect interest income to increase
    compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of our cash and invested
    balances being reinvested in a higher interest rate portfolio
    environment.



Interest Expense

— Interest expense was
    $11.6 million and $1.3 million in fiscal 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2007 was primarily
    due to interest incurred in connection with our debt.

Net Gain (Loss) on Investments

— Net gain
    (loss) on investments included a net write-down of
    $2.1 million related to the impairment of our investment in
    privately-held companies in fiscal 2007.

Other Income (Expense), Net

— Other income was
    $2.8 million for fiscal 2007. Other income for fiscal 2007
    included net exchange gains from foreign currency of
    $2.4 million and other income of $0.4 million. Other
    income included net exchange gains from foreign currency of
    $1.7 million for fiscal 2006. We believe that
    period-to-period changes in foreign exchange gains or losses
    will continue to be impacted by hedging costs associated with
    our forward and option activities and forecast variance.

Provision for Income Taxes

— For fiscal 2007,
    our annual effective tax rate was 17.2% versus 23.9% for fiscal
    2006, which included a 6.4% increase to account for the income
    tax provision of $22.5 million associated with the cash
    repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings. The decrease to the
    effective tax rate for fiscal year 2007 is primarily
    attributable to the absence of this one-time item and the impact
    of income taxed at lower tax rates in foreign jurisdiction. The
    effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 differed from the
    U.S. statutory rate primarily due to reductions in the rate
    derived from a beneficial foreign tax ruling for our principal
    European subsidiary, the availability of tax credits and the
    generation of foreign earnings in lower tax jurisdictions,
    offset partially by an increase in the rate due to the tax
    effect of stock compensation under SFAS No. 123R.

The provision for income taxes for fiscal 2006 included an
    income tax provision of $22.5 million or $0.06 per share
    associated with the repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings.
    This tax raised our 2006 effective tax rate by 6.4% under the
    one-time incentive created pursuant to Section 965 of the
    Jobs Act. We will invest these earnings pursuant to an approved
    Domestic Reinvestment Plan that conforms to the Jobs Act
    guidelines.

The 2006 Tax Relief and Health Care Act was signed into law on
    December 20, 2006. One of the provisions of this law was
    the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development
    credit from January 1, 2006 and its extension through
    December 31, 2007. The effective tax rates for the fiscal
    2007 reflected the benefits attributable to the extension of the
    research and development tax credit provisions.

Fiscal
    2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005

Product Revenues

— Product revenues increased
    by 25.1% to $1,577.4 million in fiscal 2006, from
    $1,260.6 million in fiscal 2005. Product revenues growth
    was across all geographies. This net increase year over year was
    specifically attributable to increased software licenses, an
    increase in units shipped, and an increase in demand for data
    protection and mission-critical storage environments, partially
    offset by a decline in shipments and lower average selling
    prices of older generation products, lower

cost-per-megabyte

disks.

Product revenues were favorably affected by the following
    factors:

•

Increased revenues from our current product portfolio, such as
    FAS980 and FAS270 storage systems; and introduction of new
    products, such as FAS3020, FAS3050, and FAS6070 storage systems;
    V3020 and V3050 storage virtualization systems; NetCache C2300,
    and C3300 appliances and add-on software

•

Revenue generated from disk-to-disk backup/archival, and
    security solutions increased by 28.1% in fiscal 2006 compared to
    fiscal 2005

•

Increased sales through indirect channels in absolute dollars,
    including sales through our resellers, distributors, and OEM
    partners, representing 55.5% and 51.2% of total revenues for
    fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively

Product revenues were negatively affected by the following
    factors:

•

Lower-cost-per-megabyte disks, which are a significant component
    of our hardware costs. As performance has improved on these
    devices, the related sales price we can charge per megabyte of
    storage has decreased as well.

•

Declining average selling prices and unit sales of our older
    products.



The Decru acquisition and the IBM OEM relationship did not have
    a significant impact on the revenue for fiscal 2006.

Software Upgrade and Maintenance Arrangements
    Revenues

— Software upgrade and maintenance
    arrangements revenues increased by 40.9% to $239.1 million
    in fiscal 2006, from $169.7 million in fiscal 2005 due
    primarily to a larger installed base renewals, upgrades, and an
    increasing number of new enterprise customers. Software upgrade
    and maintenance arrangements revenues represent 11.6% and 10.6%
    of total revenues for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Service Revenues

— Service revenues, which
    include hardware support, professional services, and educational
    services, increased by 48.9% to $249.9 million in fiscal
    2006, from $167.8 million in fiscal 2005.

The increase in absolute dollars was due to the following
    factors:

•

Professional service revenue increased by 49.0% to
    $89.4 million in fiscal 2006 from $60.0 million in
    fiscal 2005 due to an increasing number of enterprise customers,
    which typically have extremely complex IT environments and
    require professional services to integrate our solution into
    their environments.

•

A growing installed base resulting in new customer support
    contracts in addition to support contract renewals by existing
    customers

A large portion of our service revenues is deferred and, in most
    cases, recognized ratably over the service obligation periods,
    which are typically one to three years, and are classified as
    short-term and long-term deferred revenue on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Service revenues represented 12.1% and 10.5% of
    total revenues for fiscal year 2006 and 2005, respectively.

International total revenues

— International
    total revenues (including U.S. exports) increased by 23.2%
    in fiscal year 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. International
    total revenues were $943.8 million, or 45.7% of total
    revenues for fiscal year 2006 compared with $765.8 million
    or 47.9% of total revenues for fiscal 2005. The increase in
    international sales was primarily a result of revenue growth
    from our European and Asia Pacific geographies, driven by
    increased demand for our solutions portfolio, new customers, and
    higher storage spending in certain geographic regions as
    compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.

Product Gross Margins

— Product gross margins
    decreased to 60.9% for fiscal 2006, from 61.7% for fiscal 2005.
    Amortization of existing technology from acquisitions included
    in cost of product revenues was $11.8 million and
    $3.4 million for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Product gross margins were negatively affected by the following
    factors:

•

Sales price reductions due to competitive pricing pressure and
    selective pricing discounts

•

Increased sales through certain indirect channels, which may
    have lower gross margins than our direct sales in certain
    geographic regions

•

Sales of relatively lower margin add-on storage shelves and
    hardware increased by 57.1% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal

Product gross margins were favorably affected by the following
    factors:

•

Favorable product and add-on software mix with software licenses
    increasing by 32.8% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005

•

Higher average selling prices for our newer products

Software Upgrade and Maintenance Arrangements Gross
    Margins

— Software upgrade and maintenance
    arrangements gross margins increased slightly to 96.5% for
    fiscal 2006, from 97.0% for fiscal 2005 due primarily to
    improved productivity and a larger installed base renewals,
    upgrades, and an increasing number of new enterprise customers.



Service Gross Margins

— Service gross margins
    increased to 25.9% in fiscal 2006 compared to 19.4% in fiscal
    2005. Cost of service revenue increased by 36.9% to
    $185.0 million in fiscal 2006, from $135.2 million in
    fiscal 2005.

The improvement in service gross margins for fiscal 2006
    compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to an increase in
    services revenue and improved productivity offset by the
    continued spending in our service infrastructure to support our
    increasing enterprise customer base. This spending included
    additional professional support engineers, increased support
    center activities, and global service partnership programs.

Sales and Marketing

— Sales and marketing
    expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions, advertising
    and promotional expenses, and certain customer service and
    support costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased 28.0% to
    $599.1 million for fiscal 2006, from $468.2 million
    for fiscal 2005. These expenses were 28.9% and 29.2% of total
    revenues for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. The
    increase in absolute dollars was attributed to increased
    commission expenses resulting from increased revenues, higher
    performance-based payroll expenses due to higher profitability,
    higher partner program expenses, and the continued worldwide
    investment in our sales and global service organizations
    associated with selling complete enterprise solutions.

Compensation expenses related to stock options and restricted
    stock assumed in acquisitions were $4.0 million and
    $2.2 million for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively.
    Amortization of acquisitions-related trademarks/tradenames and
    customer contracts and relationships included in sales and
    marketing expenses was $2.1 million and $0.8 million
    for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively.

Research and Development

— Research and
    development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits,
    prototype expenses, nonrecurring engineering charges, fees paid
    to outside consultants and amortization of capitalized patents.

Research and development expenses increased 42.6% to
    $251.3 million for fiscal 2006 from $176.3 million for
    fiscal 2005. These expenses represented 12.2% and 11.0% of total
    revenues for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in
    research and development expenses was primarily a result of
    increased headcount, ongoing operating impact of the
    acquisitions, ongoing support of current and future product
    development and enhancement efforts, and higher
    performance-based payroll expenses due to higher profitability.
    For both fiscal 2006 and 2005, no software development costs
    were capitalized. Included in research and development expenses
    is amortization of acquired patents of $2.0 million and
    $1.8 million for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Compensation expenses related to stock options and restricted
    stock assumed in acquisitions was $8.3 million and
    $5.2 million for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively.

General and Administrative

— General and
    administrative expenses increased 19.6% to $92.8 million
    for fiscal 2006, from $77.6 million for fiscal 2005. These
    expenses represented 4.6% and 4.9% of total revenues for fiscal
    2006 and 2005, respectively. This increase in absolute dollars
    was primarily due to expenses associated with expanded
    regulatory requirements, higher legal expenses and professional
    fees for general corporate matters including patents and higher
    performance-based payroll expenses due to higher profitability.

Compensation expenses related to stock options and restricted
    stock assumed in acquisitions were $1.0 million and
    $0.7 million for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively.
    Amortization of acquisitions-related covenants not to compete
    included in general and administrative expenses was
    $2.2 million and $5.1 million for fiscal 2006 and
    2005, respectively.

In-Process Research and Development

— We
    recorded in-process research and development charges of
    $5.0 million in fiscal 2006 related to the acquisition of
    Decru. The purchase price of the transaction was allocated to
    the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated
    fair values as of the date of the acquisition. Approximately
    $5.0 million was allocated to in-process research and
    development and charged to operations because the acquired
    technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no
    alternative uses. The value was determined by estimating the
    costs to develop the acquired in-process technology into
    commercially viable products, estimating the resulting future
    net cash flows from such projects, and discounting the net cash
    flows back to their present value. The discount rate included a
    factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the



successful development of the acquired in-process technology.
    These estimates are subject to change, given the uncertainties
    of the development process, and no assurance can be given that
    deviations from these estimates will not occur. Research and
    development costs to bring the products from Decru to
    technological feasibility are not expected to have a material
    impact on our future results of operations or financial
    conditions.

Restructuring Charges

— In fiscal 2002, as a
    result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a
    reduction in IT spending rates, we implemented two restructuring
    plans, which included reductions in our workforce and
    consolidations of our facilities. As of April 28, 2006, we
    have no outstanding balance in our restructuring liability for
    the first restructuring. The second restructuring related to the
    closure of an engineering facility and consolidation of
    resources to the Sunnyvale headquarters. In the second quarter
    of fiscal 2006, we implemented a third restructuring plan
    related to the move of our global services center operations
    from Sunnyvale to our new flagship support center at our
    Research Triangle Park facility in North Carolina.

In fiscal 2006, we recorded a reduction in restructuring reserve
    of $1.3 million resulting from the execution of a new
    sublease agreement for our Tewksbury facility. In fiscal 2006,
    we recorded a restructuring charge of $1.1 million,
    primarily attributed to severance-related amounts and relocation
    expenses related to the third restructuring plan. Of the reserve
    balance at April 28, 2006, $0.9 million was included
    in other accrued liabilities, and the remaining
    $2.1 million was classified as long-term obligations.

Interest Income

— Interest income was
    $41.5 million and $24.2 million for fiscal 2006 and
    2005, respectively. Included in interest income for fiscal 2005
    was $1.3 million interest received on a tax refund. The
    increase in interest income was primarily driven by higher
    average interest rates on our investment portfolio.

Interest Expense

— Interest expense was
    $1.3 million and $0.1 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The increase in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to
    interest incurred in connection with our debt.

Other Income (Expense), Net

— Other Income
    (Expense), Net, included net exchange gains from foreign
    currency transactions of $1.7 million in fiscal 2006, due
    primarily to forecast variances offset by hedging costs as a
    result of higher U.S. interest rates compared to other
    countries. Net exchange losses from foreign currency
    transactions were $1.6 million in fiscal 2005 as a result
    of exchange rate volatility, forecast variances and higher
    hedging costs.

Provision for Income Taxes

— The provision for
    income taxes for fiscal 2006 included an income tax provision of
    $22.5 million or $0.06 per share associated with the
    repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings which occurred
    during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 under the one-time
    incentive created pursuant to Section 965 of the Jobs Act.
    We will invest these earnings pursuant to an approved Domestic
    Reinvestment Plan that conforms to the Jobs Act guidelines.

For fiscal 2006, we had an effective tax rate of 23.9% to pretax
    income, which included a 6.4% increase to account for the income
    tax provision of $22.5 million associated with the cash
    repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings. The effective tax
    rate for fiscal 2006 differed from the U.S. statutory rate
    primarily due to a beneficial foreign tax ruling for our
    principal European subsidiary, the availability of tax credits,
    and the generation of foreign earnings in lower tax
    jurisdictions. For fiscal 2005, our effective tax rate was 18.3%.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our
    balance sheet and cash flows, contractual obligations and other
    commercial commitments, stock repurchase program, capital
    commitments, other sources, and uses of cash flows and tax
    opportunities on our liquidity and capital resources.

Balance
    Sheet and Other Cash Flows

As of April 27, 2007, as compared to April 28, 2006,
    our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments decreased
    by $14.1 million to $1,308.8 million. We derive our
    liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flows
    from operations and from working capital. Working capital
    decreased by $62.8 million to $1,053.3 million as of
    April 27, 2007, compared to $1,116.0 million as of
    April 28, 2006.



During fiscal 2007, we generated cash flows from operating
    activities of $864.5 million, as compared with
    $554.3 million and $462.1 million for fiscal 2006 and
    fiscal 2005, respectively. We reported net income of
    $297.7 million for fiscal 2007, as compared to
    $266.5 million and $225.8 million in fiscal 2006 and
    fiscal 2005, respectively. A summary of the significant changes
    in noncash adjustments affecting net income is as follows:

•

Stock-based compensation expense was $163.0 million in
    fiscal 2007, compared to $13.3 million and
    $8.1 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    increase was the result of adopting SFAS No. 123R.

•

Depreciation expense was $87.4 million, $63.7 million,
    and $54.5 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The increase was due to continued capital
    expansion to meet our business growth.

•

Gain on sale of NetCache to Blue Coat was $25.3 million in
    fiscal 2007.

•

Amortization of intangibles was $21.4 million,
    $16.1 million, and $9.3 million in fiscal 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. The increase was attributed to the Topio
    and Decru acquisitions.

•

An increase in net deferred tax assets of $19.5 million in
    fiscal 2007 compared to a decrease of $1.5 million in
    fiscal 2006 and decrease of $6.3 million in fiscal 2005,
    primarily attributable to an increase in deferred revenue
    relating to higher software upgrade and maintenance arrangements
    and service revenues.

In addition to net income and noncash adjustments in fiscal 2007
    compared to fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, the primary factors
    that impacted the period-to-period change in cash flows relating
    to operating activities included the following:

•

An increase in deferred revenues of $421.3 million in
    fiscal 2007, compared to increase in deferred revenue of
    $233.2 million and $169.4 million in fiscal 2006 and
    2005, respectively, was due to higher software upgrade and
    maintenance arrangements and service billings attributable to
    the increase in larger enterprise customers, as well as renewals
    of existing maintenance agreements in fiscal 2007.

A decrease in income taxes payable in fiscal 2007 compared to
    fiscal 2006 primarily attributable to income taxes payment of
    the one-time repatriation incentive under the Jobs Act. During
    fiscal 2007, we remitted $19.6 million of income taxes
    relating to the foreign dividend repatriation in connection with
    the filing of our fiscal 2006 federal income tax return.
    Increased income taxes payable in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal
    2005, primarily reflecting the $22.5 million of federal and
    state tax liability relating to repatriation of accumulated
    foreign earnings under the Jobs Act and higher profitability in
    fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005.

•

Increase in accounts payable of $36.6 million,
    $17.4 million and $30.5 million in fiscal 2007, 2006,
    and 2005, respectively, was primarily attributable to elevated
    purchasing activity required to support our business growth and
    facilities expansion projects.

•

Accrued compensation and related benefits increased by
    $43.6 million, $28.4 million and $33.8 million in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, reflecting the timing
    of payroll accruals and payment.

•

Net inventory decreased $9.9 million for fiscal 2007,
    primarily due to higher inventory at fiscal 2006 year end
    associated with the new FAS 6000 launch. The increase of
    $46.2 million in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to ramping
    up of purchased components in anticipation of revenue growth.
    The increase of $15.0 million in fiscal 2005 was primarily
    due to end-of-life buys for certain products.

The above factors were partially offset by the effects of:

•

Increase in accounts receivable of $175.2 million in fiscal
    2007 was due to higher revenue volume. Increase in accounts
    receivable of $116.8 million in fiscal 2006 was due
    primarily to a shipping profile weighted toward the second half
    of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Increase of
    $103.4 million in fiscal 2005 was due to increased sales in
    fiscal 2005.

We expect that cash provided by operating activities may
    fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors,
    including fluctuations in our operating results, shipment
    linearity, accounts receivable collections, inventory
    management, and the timing of tax and other payments.



Cash
    Flows from Investing Activities

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 were $165.8 million as
    compared to $132.9 million and $93.6 million in fiscal
    2006 and 2005, respectively. We received net proceeds of
    $60.0 million in fiscal 2007, and used net proceeds of
    $128.5 million and $266.8 million in fiscal 2006 and
    2005, respectively, for net purchases/redemptions of short-term
    investments. We redeemed $127.9 million of restricted
    investments and its interest income pledged with JP Morgan Chase
    in fiscal 2007 to repay the Tranche A term loan with JP
    Morgan Chase (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements) Investing activities in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005
    also included new investments in privately-held companies of
    $1.6 million, $9.3 million, and $0.4 million,
    respectively. In fiscal 2007, we acquired Topio, Inc. for a
    purchase price of approximately $146.1 million, which
    consisted of the value of the assumed options, cash payments of
    $131.2 million, and related transaction costs. In fiscal
    2006, we acquired Alacritus and Decru and incurred total cash
    payments including related transactions costs totaling
    $53.7 million. In fiscal 2005, we acquired additional
    patents for a purchase price of approximately $0.9 million.
    In fiscal 2007, we received $23.9 million in cash in
    connection with the sale of certain assets to Blue Coat. We
    received $2.8 million, $0.1 million, and
    $0.3 million in proceeds from the sale of investments in
    privately-held companies in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005,
    respectively. Under a split dollar insurance arrangement with
    our CEO entered in May 2000, we paid total premiums of
    $10.2 million, including $0.2 million for fiscal year
    2005. In April 2005, our CEO reimbursed us $10.2 million
    for these premiums.

Cash
    Flows from Financing Activities

We used $747.3 million and $12.1 million in fiscal
    2007 and 2005, respectively, as compared to cash provided by
    financing activities of $42.8 million in fiscal 2006.
    During fiscal 2006, we borrowed $300.0 million to fund the
    repatriation in cash from foreign earnings and investments under
    the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (“the Jobs
    Act”). We made a repayment of $214.9 million for our
    debt in fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, we
    repurchased 22.6 million, 17.4 million, and
    7.7 million shares of common stock at a total of
    $805.7 million, $488.9 million, and
    $192.9 million, respectively. Other financing activities
    provided $215.5 million, $232.7 million, and
    $181.9 million in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005,
    respectively, from sales of common stock related to employee
    stock option exercises and employee stock purchases. Tax
    benefits, related to tax deductions in excess of the stock-based
    compensation expense recognized, of $63.2 million were
    presented as financing cash flows for fiscal 2007 in accordance
    with SFAS No. 123R. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    we withheld $5.3 million, $1.1 million, and
    $1.1 million in shares, respectively, from certain
    employees’ exercised shares of their restricted stock to
    reimburse for federal, state, and local withholding taxes
    obligations. The increase in the amounts withheld year over year
    was due to the release of the Decru assumed restricted stock
    units.

The change in cash flow from financing was primarily due to the
    effects of higher common stock repurchases partially offset by
    proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee equity
    programs compared to the same period in the prior year. Net
    proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee
    participation in employee stock programs have historically been
    a significant component of our liquidity. The extent to which
    our employees participate in these programs generally increases
    or decreases based upon changes in the market price of our
    common stock. As a result, our cash flow resulting from the
    issuance of common stock related to employee participation in
    employee stock programs will vary.

Other
    Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Jobs Act created a one-time incentive for
    U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned
    abroad by providing an 85% dividend-received deduction for
    certain dividends from certain

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

Primarily as a result of this one-time repatriation incentive,
    we remitted $19.6 million of income taxes with the filing
    of our fiscal year 2006 federal income tax return.

For fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, the income tax benefit
    associated with dispositions of employee stock transactions was
    $175.0 million, $36.6 million, and $27.8 million,
    respectively. If stock option exercise patterns change, we may
    receive less cash from stock option exercises and may not
    receive the same level of tax benefits in the future, which
    could cause our cash payments for income taxes to increase.



Stock
    Repurchase Program

On November 15, 2006, the Board of Directors approved a new
    stock repurchase program in which up to $800.0 million of
    additional shares may be purchased. At April 27, 2007,
    $399.9 million remained available for future repurchase.
    The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at
    any time.

Debt

In March 2006, we received proceeds from the term loans totaling
    $300.0 million to finance a dividend under the Jobs Act.
    (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Loan
    payments of $85.1 million are due in fiscal 2008. This debt
    was collateralized by restricted investments totaling
    $116.0 million as of April 27, 2007. In accordance
    with the payment terms of the loan agreement, interest payments
    will be approximately $2.7 million in fiscal 2008. As of
    April 27, 2007, we are in compliance with the liquidity and
    leverage ratio as required by the Loan Agreement with the
    lenders.

Contractual
    Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments

The following summarizes our contractual cash obligations and
    commercial commitments at April 27, 2007, and the effect

For purposes of the above table, contractual obligations for the
    purchase of goods and services are defined as agreements that
    are enforceable, legally binding on us, and subject us to
    penalties if we cancel the agreement. Some of the figures we
    include in this table are based on management’s estimates
    and assumptions about these obligations, including their
    duration, the possibility of renewal or termination, anticipated
    actions by third parties, and other factors. Because these
    estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the
    enforceable and legally binding obligations we will actually pay
    in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table.

We lease sales offices, research and development facilities, and
    other property under operating leases throughout the U.S. and
    internationally, which expire through fiscal 2016. Substantially
    all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the
    passage of time and contain escalation clauses. Some lease
    agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or to
    terminate the lease. Our future operating lease obligations



Capital
    Expenditure Requirements

We expect capital expenditures to increase in the future
    consistent with the growth in our business, as we continue to
    invest in people, land, buildings, capital equipment, and
    enhancements to our worldwide infrastructure. We expect that our
    existing facilities and those being developed in Sunnyvale,
    California; RTP, North Carolina; and worldwide are adequate for
    our requirements over at least the next two years and that
    additional space will be available as needed. We expect to
    finance these construction projects, including our commitments
    under facilities and equipment operating leases, and any
    required capital expenditures over the next few years through
    cash from operations and existing cash, cash equivalents and
    investments.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

As of April 27, 2007, our financial guarantees of
    $3.4 million that were not recorded on our balance sheet
    consisted of standby letters of credit related to workers’
    compensation, a customs guarantee, a corporate credit card
    program, and a foreign rent guarantee.

As of April 27, 2007, our notional fair values of foreign
    exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled
    $368.8 million. We do not believe that these derivatives
    present significant credit risks because the counterparties to
    the derivatives consist of major financial institutions, and we
    manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any
    one counterparty. We do not enter into derivative financial
    instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Other than the
    risk associated with the financial condition of the
    counterparties, our maximum exposure related to foreign currency
    forward and option contracts is limited to the premiums paid.



We have entered into indemnification agreements with third
    parties in the ordinary course of business. Generally, these
    indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses
    suffered by the third party due to various events, such as
    lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement. These
    indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet
    arrangements in accordance with FASB, Interpretation 45, of
    FIN 45,

“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
    Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
    Indebtedness of Others.”

See “Guarantees” in
    footnote 15 for further discussion of these indemnification
    agreements.

We have commitments related to two lease arrangements with BNP
    for approximately 380,000 square feet of office space to be
    located on land currently owned by us in Sunnyvale, California
    (as further described above under “Contractual Cash
    Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments”). We have
    evaluated our accounting for this lease under the provisions of
    FIN 46R, and have determined the following:

•

BNP is a leasing company for BNP Paribas in the U.S. BNP is
    not a “special purpose entity” organized for the sole
    purpose of facilitating the lease to us. The obligation to
    absorb expected losses and receive expected residual returns
    rests with the parent BNP Paribas. Therefore, we are not the
    primary beneficiary of BNP as we do not absorb the majority of
    BNP’s expected losses or expected residual returns; and

•

BNP has represented in the Closing Agreement (filed as
    Exhibit 10.40) that the fair value of the property leased
    to us by BNP is less than half of the total of the fair values
    of all assets of BNP, excluding any assets of BNP held within a
    silo. Further, the property leased to Network Appliance is not
    held within a silo. The definition of “held within a
    silo” means that BNP has obtained funds equal to or in
    excess of 95% of the fair value of the leased asset to acquire
    or maintain its investment in such asset through nonrecourse
    financing or other contractual arrangements, the effect of which
    is to leave such asset (or proceeds thereof) as the only
    significant asset of BNP at risk for the repayment of such funds.

Accordingly, we are not required to consolidate either the
    leasing entity or the specific assets that we lease under the
    BNP lease. Assuming this transaction will continue to meet the
    provisions of FIN 46R as new standards evolve over time,
    our future minimum lease payments under this real estates lease
    will amount to a total of $117.8 million reported under our
    Note 4, “Commitments and Contingencies”.

As of April 27, 2007, except for operating leases and other
    contractual obligations outlined under the “Contractual
    Cash Obligations” table, we do not have any off-balance
    sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, retained or
    contingent interests in transferred assets, or any obligation
    arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated
    entity. We also do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that
    are not included in the consolidated financial statements.
    Additionally, we do not have any interest in or relationship
    with any special purpose entities.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resource Requirements

Key factors affecting our cash flows include our ability to
    effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts
    receivable and inventories and future demand for our products
    and related pricing. We expect to incur higher capital
    expenditures in the near future to expand our operations. We
    will from time to time acquire products and businesses
    complementary to our business. In the future, we may continue to
    repurchase our common stock, which would reduce cash, cash
    equivalents,

and/or

short-term investments available to fund future operations and
    meet other liquidity requirements. Based on past performance and
    current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash
    equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated from
    operations will satisfy our working capital needs, capital
    expenditures, stock repurchases, contractual obligations, and
    other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for
    at least the next twelve months.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in
    interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We use
    certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks.
    We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative
    or trading purposes. All financial instruments are used in
    accordance with management-approved policies.



Market
    Risk and Market Interest Risk

Investment and Interest Income

— As of
    April 27, 2007, we had available-for-sale investments of
    $935.7 million. Our investment portfolio primarily consists
    of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the
    date of purchase of greater than three months, which are
    classified as available for sale. These investments, consisting
    primarily of corporate bonds, corporate securities, government,
    municipal debt securities, and auction-rate securities, are
    subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will
    decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A
    hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates
    from levels at April 27, 2007, would cause the fair value
    of these available-for-sale investments to decline by
    approximately $4.1 million. Because we have the ability to
    hold these investments until maturity, we would not expect any
    significant decline in value of our investments caused by market
    interest rate changes. Declines in interest rates over time
    will, however, reduce our interest income. We do not use
    derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.

Our investment policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure
    through diversification and investment in highly rated
    securities. We further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in
    our investments by limiting our investments in the debt
    securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across
    geographies and type of issuer. We have not experienced any
    material losses on our available-for-sale investments.

Our investment portfolio also includes common stock holdings in
    Blue Coat (see Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial
    Statements). We are exposed to fluctuations in the market price
    of our investment in this company. At the same time, we are
    precluded from selling these shares until September 2007. As a
    result of these factors, the amount of income and cash flow that
    we ultimately realize from this investment may vary materially
    from the current unrealized amount. A hypothetical
    10 percent decrease in the fair market value from fair
    market value at April 27, 2007 would cause the fair value
    of this investment to decrease by approximately
    $1.3 million.

Lease Commitments

— As of April 27, 2007,
    we have two arrangements with BNP to lease our land for a period
    of 50 years to construct approximately 380,000 square
    feet of office space and a parking structure costing up to
    $103.5 million. After completion of construction, we will
    pay minimum lease payments, which vary based on London Interbank
    Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread. We expect to pay
    lease payments on the first lease in October 2007 for a term of
    five years, and the second lease in September 2008 for a term of
    five years. We have the option to renew both leases for two
    consecutive five-year periods upon approval by BNP. A
    hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates
    from levels at April 27, 2007 would increase our total
    lease payments under the initial five-year term by approximately
    $2.8 million. We do not currently hedge against market
    interest rate increases. As cash from operating cash flows is
    invested in a higher interest rate environment, it will offer a
    natural hedge against interest rate risk from our lease
    commitments in the event of a significant increase in market
    interest rate.

Debt Obligation

— We have an outstanding
    variable rate term loan totaling $85.1 million as of
    April 27, 2007. Under terms of these arrangements, we
    expect to pay interest payments at LIBOR plus a spread. A
    hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates
    from levels at April 27, 2007 would increase our total
    interest payments by approximately $0.4 million. We do not
    currently use derivatives to manage interest rate risk.

Non-Marketable securities

— We have from time
    to time made cash investments in companies with distinctive
    technologies that are potentially strategically important to us.
    Our investments in nonmarketable securities would be negatively
    affected by an adverse change in equity market prices, although
    the impact cannot be directly quantified. Such a change, or any
    negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the
    companies whose nonmarketable securities we own, would harm the
    ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the
    likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of
    our investments through liquidity events such as initial public
    offerings, acquisitions, and private sales. These types of
    investments involve a high degree of risk, and there can be no
    assurance that any company we invest in will grow or be
    successful. We do not currently engage in any hedging activities
    to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to such
    nonmarketable investment. Accordingly, we could lose all or part
    of this investment if there is an adverse change in the market
    price of the company we invest in. Our investments in
    nonmarketable securities had a carrying amount of
    $8.9 million as of April 27, 2007 and
    $11.0 million as of April 28, 2006. If we determine
    that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value exists for a
    nonmarketable equity security, we write down the investment to
    its fair value and record the related write-down as an
    investment loss in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In
    fiscal 2007, we recorded a noncash,



other-than-temporary write-down of $2.1 million related to
    impairment of our investment in two privately-held companies.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward
    Contracts

We hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to
    minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates on earnings. We utilize forward and option contracts to
    hedge against the short-term impact of foreign currency
    fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in
    foreign currencies. All balance sheet hedges are marked to
    market through earnings every period. We also use foreign
    exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted
    transactions related to certain sales and operating expenses.
    These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under
    SFAS No. 133. For cash flow hedges outstanding at
    April 27, 2007, the gains or losses were included in other
    comprehensive income.

We do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative
    or trading purposes. In entering into forward and option foreign
    exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise
    from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms
    of their contracts. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit
    risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy
    multinational commercial banks. All contracts have a maturity of
    less than one year.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Network Appliance, Inc.

Sunnyvale, California

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Network Appliance, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of April 27, 2007 and
    April 28, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of
    income, cash flows and stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended April 27,
    2007, April 28, 2006, and April 29, 2005. Our audits
    also included the consolidated financial statement schedule
    listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial
    statements and the financial statement schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
    statements and the financial statement schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    Network Appliance, Inc. and subsidiaries as of April 27,
    2007 and April 28, 2006, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for the years ended
    April 27, 2007, April 28, 2006, and April 29,
    2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
    in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such
    financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to
    the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
    present fairly, in all material respects, the information set
    forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, in fiscal year 2007, the Company changed its method
    of accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with
    guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of April 27, 2007, based on the
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
    June 25, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an
    unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollar
    and share amounts in thousands, except per-share data)

1.

The
    Company

Based in Sunnyvale, California, Network Appliance was
    incorporated in California in April 1992 and reincorporated in
    Delaware in November 2001. Network Appliance, Inc.
    (“we” or “the Company”) is a supplier of
    enterprise storage and data management software and hardware
    products and services. Our solutions help global enterprises
    meet major information technology challenges such as managing
    storage growth, assuring secure and timely information access,
    protecting data and controlling costs by providing innovative
    solutions that simplify the complexity associated with managing
    corporate data. Network Appliance solutions are the data
    management and storage foundation for many of the world’s
    leading corporations and government agencies.

2.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Fiscal Year

— We operate on a 52-week or
    53-week year ending on the last Friday in April. Fiscal 2007,
    2006, and 2005 were all 52-week fiscal years.

Basis of Presentation

— The consolidated
    financial statements include the Company and its wholly-owned
    subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions are
    eliminated in consolidation.

Risk and Uncertainties

— There are no
    concentrations of business transacted with a particular customer
    nor concentrations of sales from a particular market or
    geographic area that would severely impact our business in the
    near term. However, we currently rely on a limited number of
    suppliers for certain key components and several key contract
    manufacturers to manufacture most of our products; any
    disruption or termination of these arrangements could materially
    adversely affect our operating results.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— We consider all
    highly liquid debt investments with original maturities of three
    months or less to be cash equivalents at time of purchase.

Available-for-Sale Investments

—
    Available-for-sale investments with original maturities of
    greater than three months are classified as short-term
    investments as these investments generally consist of highly
    marketable securities that are intended to be available to meet
    current cash requirements. All of our investments are classified
    as available-for-sale, are carried at fair market value, and
    unrealized gains or losses are recorded, net of taxes in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a
    separate component of stockholders’ equity. Any gains or
    losses on sales of investments are computed based upon specific
    identification. For all periods presented, realized gains and
    losses on available-for-sale investments were not material.
    Management determines the appropriate classification of debt and
    equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the
    classification at each reporting date. The fair value of our
    available-for-sale investments was $935,762 and $1,102,787 as of
    April 27, 2007, and April 28, 2006, respectively.

Restricted Investments

— We have
    available-for-sale investments that are pledged as collateral
    pursuant to the Loan Agreement entered into with JPMorgan Chase
    Bank. These investments are classified as short-term and
    long-term restricted investment in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets in accordance with the investment maturity and loan
    repayment schedule.

Investments in Nonpublic Companies

— We have
    certain investments in nonpublicly-traded companies in which we
    have less than 20% of the voting rights and in which we do not
    exercise significant influence and accordingly, we account for
    these investments under the cost method. As of April 27,
    2007 and April 28, 2006, $8,932 and $11,020 of these
    investments are included in other long-term assets on the
    balance sheet. We perform periodic reviews of our investments
    for impairment.

Other-than-temporary Impairment

— All of our
    available-for-sale investments and nonmarketable equity
    securities are subject to a periodic impairment review.
    Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair
    value is judged to be other-than-temporary. This determination
    requires significant judgment. For publicly traded investments,
    impairment is determined based upon the specific facts and
    circumstances present at the time,



NETWORK
    APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

including factors such as current economic and market
    conditions, the credit rating of the security’s issuer, the
    length of time an investment’s fair value has been below
    our carrying value, and our ability to hold investments to
    maturity. If an investment’s decline in fair value, caused
    by factors other than changes in interest rates, is deemed to be
    other-than-temporary, we would reduce its carrying value to its
    estimated fair value, as determined based on quoted market
    prices or liquidation values. Declines in value judged to be
    other-than-temporary, if any, are recorded in operations as
    incurred. For nonmarketable equity securities, the impairment
    analysis requires the identification of events or circumstances
    that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair
    value of the investment, including revenue and earnings trends,
    overall business prospects, limited capital resources, limited
    prospects of receiving additional financing, limited prospects
    for liquidity of the related securities and general market
    conditions in the investees’ industry.

Inventories

— Inventories are stated at the
    lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out basis) or market. Cost components include materials,
    labor, and manufacturing overhead costs. We write down inventory
    and record purchase commitment liabilities for excess and
    obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of
    inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions
    about future demand and market conditions.

Property and Equipment

— Property and equipment
    are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets, which range from three to five years. The land at the
    Sunnyvale headquarters site and Research Triangle Park
    (“RTP”), North Carolina, are not depreciated but are
    reviewed for impairment similar to our review of goodwill and
    intangible assets discussed below. Leasehold improvements are
    amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the
    assets or the remaining term of the lease. Building improvements
    are amortized over the estimated lives of the assets, which
    range from 10 to 40 years. Construction in progress will be
    amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective
    assets when they are ready for their intended use.

We review the carrying values of long-lived assets whenever
    events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an
    asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows
    from its use and eventual disposition. The amount of impairment
    loss, if any, is measured as the difference between the net book
    value and the estimated fair value of the asset.

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

—
    Goodwill and identifiable intangibles are accounted for in
    accordance with SFAS No. 141,

“Business
    Combinations,”

and SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

We
    recorded goodwill and identifiable intangibles related to the
    acquisitions and evaluate these items for impairment on an
    annual basis, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable. If an
    evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash
    flows associated with these assets would be compared to their
    carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair market
    value or discounted cash flow value is required. We performed an
    annual impairment test of goodwill as of February 23, 2007,
    and February 24, 2006, respectively, and found no
    impairment.

Purchased intangible assets include patents, trademarks,
    tradenames, customer contracts/relationships and covenants not
    to compete, which are carried at cost less accumulated
    amortization. Amortization of purchased intangible assets is
    computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful
    lives of the assets, which range from 18 months to six
    years. See Note 14, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible
    Assets.”

Revenue Recognition

—  We apply the provisions
    of Statement of Position (“SOP”)

No. 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,”

and related
    interpretations to our product sales, both hardware and
    software, because our software is essential to the performance
    of our hardware. We recognize revenue when:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists:

It is our customary practice to have a
    purchase order

and/or

contract prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement from our
    end users, customers, value-added resellers, or distributors.



NETWORK
    APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

Delivery has occurred:

Our product is
    physically delivered to our customers, generally with standard
    transfer terms such as FOB origin. We typically do not allow for
    restocking rights with any of our value-added resellers or
    distributors. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or
    return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria
    are achieved. If undelivered products or services exist that are
    essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an
    arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred.

•

The fee is fixed or determinable:

Arrangements
    with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms,
    conditions, and practices are not considered to be fixed or
    determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized as
    the fees become due and payable. We typically do not allow for
    price-protection rights with any of our value-added resellers or
    distributors.

•

Collection is probable:

Probability of
    collection is assessed on a

customer-by-customer

basis. Customers are subjected to a credit review process that
    evaluates the customers’ financial position and ultimately
    their ability to pay. If it is determined at the outset of an
    arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our
    review process, revenue is recognized upon cash receipt.

Our multiple element arrangements include our systems and
    generally may also include one or more of the following
    undelivered software-related elements: software upgrade and
    maintenance arrangements, premium hardware maintenance, and
    storage review services. Our software upgrade and maintenance
    arrangements entitle our customers to receive unspecified
    product upgrades and enhancements on a

when-and-if-available

basis, bug fixes, and patch releases. Premium hardware
    maintenance services include contracts for technical support and
    minimum response times. Revenues from software upgrade and
    maintenance arrangements, premium hardware maintenance services
    and storage review services are recognized ratably over the
    contractual term, generally from one to three years. Standard
    hardware warranty costs are considered an obligation under
    SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

and
    expensed as a cost of service when revenue is recognized. We
    also offer extended service contracts (which extend our standard
    parts warranty and may include premium hardware maintenance) at
    the end of the warranty term; revenues from these contracts are
    recognized ratably over the contract term. We typically sell
    technical consulting services separately from any of our other
    revenue elements, either on a time and materials basis or for
    fixed price standard projects; we recognize revenue for these
    services as they are performed. Revenue from hardware
    installation services is recognized at the time of delivery and
    any remaining costs are accrued, as the remaining undelivered
    services are considered to be inconsequential and perfunctory.
    For arrangements with multiple elements, we recognize as revenue
    the difference between the total arrangement price and the
    greater of fair value or stated price for any undelivered
    elements (“the residual method”).

For our undelivered software-related elements, we apply the
    provisions of

SOP No. 97-2

and determine fair value of these undelivered elements based on
    vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”), which for
    us consists of the prices charged when these services are sold
    separately either alone, in the case of software upgrade and
    maintenance arrangements, or as a bundled element which always
    includes software upgrade and maintenance arrangements and
    premium hardware maintenance, and may also include storage
    review services. To determine the fair value of these elements,
    we analyze both the selling prices when elements are sold
    separately as well as the concentrations of those prices. We
    believe those concentrations have been sufficient to enable us
    to establish VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements. If
    VSOE cannot be obtained to establish fair value of the
    undelivered elements, paragraph 12 of SOP

No. 97-2

would require that revenue from the entire arrangement be
    initially deferred and recognized ratably over the period these
    elements are delivered.

For income statement presentation purposes, once fair value has
    been determined for our undelivered bundled elements, we
    allocate revenue first to software upgrade and maintenance
    arrangements based on VSOE of its separate fair value, and then
    the residual is allocated to other service revenues.

We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at
    the time of shipment. Sales returns are estimated based on
    historical sales returns, current trends, and our expectations
    regarding future experience. We monitor and analyze the accuracy
    of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and
    adjust them for future expectations to



NETWORK

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

determine the adequacy of our current and future reserve needs.
    If actual future returns and allowances differ from past
    experience, additional allowances may be required.

We also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for
    estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility
    of specific customer accounts and the aging of our accounts
    receivable. We analyze accounts receivable and historical bad
    debts, customer concentrations, customer solvency, current
    economic and geographic trends, and changes in customer payment
    terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of the
    allowance for doubtful accounts. Our allowance for doubtful
    accounts as of April 27, 2007, was $2,572, compared to
    $2,380 as of April 28, 2006. If the financial condition of
    our customers deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their
    ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

Deferred Revenues

— Deferred revenues consist
    primarily of amounts related to the software upgrade and
    maintenance arrangements and other service arrangements
    described in revenue recognition above.

Software Development Costs

— The costs for the
    development of new software products and substantial
    enhancements to existing software products are expensed as
    incurred until technological feasibility has been established,
    at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in
    accordance with SFAS No. 86,

“Accounting for
    the Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
    Marketed.”

Because we believe our current process for
    developing software is essentially completed concurrently with
    the establishment of technological feasibility, which occurs
    upon the completion of a working model, no costs have been
    capitalized for any of the periods presented. In accordance with

SOP No. 98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed
    or Obtained for Internal Use,”

the cost of internally
    developed software is capitalized and included in property and
    equipment at the point at which the conceptual formulation,
    design, and testing of possible software project alternatives
    have been completed and management authorizes and commits to
    funding the project. Pilot projects and projects where expected
    future economic benefits are less than probable are not
    capitalized. Internally developed software costs include the
    cost of software tools and licenses used in the development of
    our systems, as well as consulting costs. Completed projects are
    transferred to property and equipment at cost and are amortized
    on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives,
    generally three years. We did not capitalize any software
    development costs in fiscal 2007 and 2006.

Income Taxes

— Deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities are provided for temporary differences that will
    result in future tax deductions or income in future periods, as
    well as the future benefit of tax credit carryforwards. A
    valuation allowance reduces tax assets to their estimated
    realizable value. In years prior to fiscal 2006,
    U.S. income taxes were not provided on that portion of
    unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were expected
    to be reinvested indefinitely. The Jobs Act created a one-time
    incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated
    income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividend-received
    deduction for certain dividends from certain

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we repatriated
    $405,500 of accumulated foreign earnings and recorded a $22,500
    federal and state income tax liability upon the remittance of
    those foreign earnings. As of our fiscal year ended
    April 27, 2007, the amount of accumulated unremitted
    earnings from our foreign subsidiaries under APB No. 23 is
    approximately $330,000.

In addition, we record liabilities related to uncertain income
    tax positions. Determining these liabilities requires us to make
    significant estimates and judgments as to whether, and the
    extent to which, additional taxes may be due based on potential
    tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions
    throughout the world. Our estimates are based on the outcomes of
    previous audits, as well as the precedents set in cases in which
    others have taken similar tax positions to those taken by us. If
    we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the
    liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations,
    we adjust the liability and effect a related change in our tax
    provision during the period in which we make such a
    determination.

Foreign Currency Translation

— For subsidiaries
    whose functional currency is the local currency, gains and
    losses resulting from translation of these foreign currency
    financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded within
    stockholders’ equity as part of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries where the
    functional currency is the U.S. dollar, gains and losses
    resulting from the process of remeasuring foreign currency
    financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in
    other income (expenses), net.

Derivative Instruments

— We follow
    SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”

as amended.
    Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to
    fair value through earnings. If the derivative is designated as
    a hedge, depending on the nature of the exposure being hedged,
    changes in fair value will either be offset against the change
    in fair value of the hedged items through earnings or recognized
    in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is
    recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedge is
    recognized in earnings immediately. For all periods presented,
    realized gains and losses on the ineffective portion of our
    hedges were not material.

As a result of our significant international operations, we are
    subject to risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates. We
    use derivative financial instruments, principally currency
    forward contracts and currency options, to attempt to minimize
    the impact of exchange rate movements on our balance sheet and
    operating results. Factors that could have an impact on the
    effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of
    forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets. These
    programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the
    impact of currency exchange movements. The maturities of these
    instruments are generally less than one year.

Currently, we do not enter into any foreign exchange forward
    contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments or
    nonmarketable investments. Our major foreign currency exchange
    exposures and related hedging programs are described below:

Balance Sheet.

We utilize foreign currency
    forward and options contracts to hedge exchange rate
    fluctuations related to certain foreign assets and liabilities.
    Gains and losses on these derivatives offset gains and losses on
    the assets and liabilities being hedged and the net amount is
    included in earnings. In fiscal 2007, net gains generated by
    hedged assets and liabilities totaled $5,180, which were offset
    by losses on the related derivative instruments of $2,829. In
    fiscal 2006, net gains generated by hedged assets and
    liabilities totaled $3,505, which were offset by losses on the
    related derivative instruments of $1,681. In fiscal 2005, net
    gains generated by hedged assets and liabilities totaled $4,312,
    which were offset by losses on the related derivative
    instruments of $5,933.

The premiums paid on the foreign currency option contracts are
    recognized as a reduction to other income when the contract is
    entered into. Other than the risk associated with the financial
    condition of the counterparties, our maximum exposure related to
    foreign currency options is limited to the premiums paid.

Forecasted Transactions.

We use currency
    forward contracts to hedge exposures related to forecasted sales
    and operating expenses denominated in certain foreign
    currencies. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges
    and in general closely match the underlying forecasted
    transactions in duration. The contracts are carried on the
    balance sheet at fair value, and the effective portion of the
    contracts’ gains and losses is recorded as other
    comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs.

If the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur, or it
    becomes probable that they will not occur, the gain or loss on
    the related cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in
    earnings. For fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, we did not
    record any gains or losses related to forecasted transactions
    that did not occur or became improbable.

We measure the effectiveness of hedges of forecasted
    transactions on at least a quarterly basis by comparing the fair
    values of the designated currency forward contracts with the
    fair values of the forecasted transactions. No ineffectiveness
    was recognized in earnings during fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of April 27, 2007, the notional fair values of foreign
    exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled
    $368,807.

We do not believe that these derivatives present significant
    credit risks, because the counterparties to the derivatives
    consist of major financial institutions, and we manage the
    notional amount of contracts entered into with any one
    counterparty. We do not enter into derivative financial
    instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of the
    consolidated financial statements and related disclosures is in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America and requires management to establish
    accounting policies which contain estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates.

Concentration of Credit Risk and Allowance for Doubtful
    Accounts

— Financial instruments that potentially
    subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of
    cash equivalents, short-term investments, foreign exchange
    contracts and accounts receivable. Cash, cash equivalents,
    short-term investments consist primarily of corporate bonds,
    U.S. government agencies, and money market funds, all of
    which are high investment grade. Our policy is to limit the
    amount of credit exposure through diversification and investment
    in highly rated securities. We further mitigate concentrations
    of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in
    the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk
    across geographies and type of issuer. In entering into forward
    foreign exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might
    arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the
    terms of their contracts. The counterparties to these contracts
    are major multinational commercial banks, and we do not expect
    any losses as a result of counterparty defaults. We sell our
    products primarily to large organizations in different
    industries and geographies. Credit risk is mitigated by our
    credit evaluation process and limited payment terms. We do not
    require collateral or other security to support accounts
    receivable. In addition, we maintain an allowance for potential
    credit losses.

Comprehensive Income

— Comprehensive income is
    defined as the change in equity during a period from nonowner
    sources. Comprehensive income for the fiscal years 2007, 2006,
    and 2005 has been disclosed within the consolidated statement of
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss).

Net Income per Share

— Basic net income per
    share is computed by dividing income available to common
    stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding for that period. Diluted net income per share is
    computed giving effect to all dilutive potential shares that
    were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common
    shares consist of incremental common shares subject to
    repurchase, common shares issuable upon exercise of stock
    options, and restricted stock awards.

    with a weighted average exercise price of $45.00, $65.34, and
    $52.81 respectively, were excluded from the diluted net income
    per share computation, as their exercise prices were greater
    than the average market price of the common shares for the
    periods presented and would therefore be antidilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

— On April 29,
    2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R,

“Share

-

Based Payment”

(“SFAS No. 123R”), which required us to
    measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based
    payments awards, including employee stock options, restricted
    stock units and rights to purchase shares under employee stock
    purchase plans, based on their estimated fair value and to
    recognize the costs in our financial statements over the
    employees’ requisite service period. Total stock-based
    compensation expense recognized in fiscal 2007 was $163,033.

The fair value of employee restricted stock units are equal to
    the market value of our common stock on the date the award is
    granted. Calculating the fair value of employee stock options
    and the rights to purchase shares under the employee stock
    purchase plans requires estimates and significant judgment. We
    use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair
    value of these awards, consistent with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123R. The fair value of each option grant is
    estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model, and is not remeasured as a result of subsequent
    stock price fluctuations. Option-pricing models require the
    input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected
    term of options, the expected price volatility of the stock
    underlying such options and forfeiture rate. Our expected term
    assumption is based primarily on historical exercise and
    post-vesting forfeiture experience. As of April 29, 2006,
    the contractual life of our stock options was shortened to seven
    years from ten years for options issued on or after this date,
    and to the extent that the shorter life changes employees’
    exercise behavior, it may change the expected term of an option
    going forward. Our stock price volatility assumption is based on
    an implied volatility of call options and dealer quotes on call
    options, generally having a term of greater than twelve months.
    Changes in the subjective assumptions required in the valuation
    models may significantly affect the estimated value of our
    stock-based awards, the related stock-based compensation expense
    and, consequently, our results of operations. Likewise, the
    shortening of the contractual life of our options could change
    the estimated exercise behavior in a manner other than currently
    expected.



NETWORK
    APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In addition, SFAS 123R requires that we estimate the number
    of stock-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee
    turnover. Our forfeiture assumption is based primarily on
    historical experience. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate
    can have a significant effect on reported stock-based
    compensation expense, as the effect of adjusting the rate for
    all expense amortization after April 28, 2006 is recognized
    in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If the actual
    forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate,
    then an adjustment will be made to increase the estimated
    forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense
    recognized in the financial statements. If the actual forfeiture
    rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an
    adjustment will be made to lower the estimated forfeiture rate,
    which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in
    our financial statements. The expense we recognize in future
    periods will be affected by changes in the estimated forfeiture
    rate and may differ significantly from amounts recognized in the
    current period

and/or

our
    forecasts.

Had compensation expense been determined based on the fair value
    at the grant date for awards, consistent with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123, our pro forma net income and pro forma
    net income per share for fiscal 2006 and 2005, would be as

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

— In
    February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 159,

“The Fair
    Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115.”

SFAS No. 159 allows
    measurement at fair value of eligible financial assets and
    liabilities that are not otherwise measured at fair value. If
    the fair value option for an eligible item is elected,
    unrealized gains and losses for that item shall be reported in
    current earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
    SFAS No. 159 also establishes presentation and
    disclosure requirements designed to draw comparison between the
    different measurement attributes the company elects for similar
    types of assets and liabilities. This statement is effective for
    our fiscal year beginning April 27, 2008. We are currently
    evaluating the effect, if any, that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 159 will have on our consolidated financial
    statements

In September, 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

“Fair Value Measurements.”

SFAS No. 157 provides a framework for measuring
    fair value, clarifies the definition of fair value, and expands
    disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value
    measurements and eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in
    various prior accounting pronouncements. We are required to
    adopt SFAS No. 157 for our fiscal year beginning
    April 27, 2008. We are currently evaluating the effect that
    the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our
    consolidated results of operations and financial condition, but
    do not expect it to have a material impact.

In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
    (“SAB”) No. 108,

“Considering the Effects
    of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
    Current Year Financial Statements.”

SAB No. 108 provides guidance on how prior year
    misstatements should be taken into consideration when
    quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements
    for purposes of determining whether the current year’s
    financial statements are materially misstated.
    SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending on or
    after November 15, 2006. We adopted SAB 108 in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and its adoption did not have an
    impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes —
    an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”

(“FIN No. 48”). FIN No. 48
    prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should
    recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial
    statements uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or
    expects to take on a tax return (including a decision whether to
    file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction).
    FIN No. 48 is applicable to all uncertain tax
    positions for taxes accounted for under FASB Statement
    No. 109,

“Accounting for Income Taxes”

(SFAS No. 109), and substantially changes the
    applicable accounting model. We are required to adopt
    FIN No. 48 for our fiscal year beginning
    April 28, 2007. We are currently evaluating the effect that
    the adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on our
    consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

The unrealized losses on our investments in Corporate Bonds and
    U.S. government agencies were caused by interest rate
    increases. We believe that we will be able to collect all
    principal and interest amounts due to us at maturity given the
    high credit quality of these investments. Because the decline in
    market value is attributable to

changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because we
    have the ability and intent to hold those investments until a
    recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, we do not

On December 16, 2005, we entered into financing,
    construction, and leasing arrangements with BNP for office space
    to be located on land currently owned by us in Sunnyvale,
    California. These arrangements require us to lease our land to
    BNP for a period of 50 years to construct approximately
    190,000 square feet of office space costing up to $38,500.
    After completion of construction, we will pay minimum lease
    payments, which vary based on LIBOR plus a spread (5.77% at
    April 27, 2007) on the cost of the facilities. We
    expect to begin making lease payments on the completed buildings
    in October 2007 for a term of five years. We have the option to
    renew the lease for two consecutive five-year periods upon
    approval by BNP. Upon expiration (or upon any earlier
    termination) of the lease term, we must elect one of the
    following options: We may (i) purchase the building from
    BNP for $38,500, (ii) if certain conditions are met,
    arrange for the sale of the building by BNP to a third party for
    an amount equal to at least $32,725, and be liable for any
    deficiency between the net proceeds received from the third
    party and $32,725, or (iii) pay BNP a supplemental payment
    of $32,725, in which event we may recoup some or all of such
    payment by arranging for a sale of the building by BNP during
    the ensuing two-year period.

On December 14, 2006, we entered into additional financing,
    construction, and leasing arrangements with BNP for office space
    to be located on land currently owned by us in Sunnyvale,
    California. These arrangements require us to lease our land to
    BNP for a period of 50 years to construct approximately

space and parking structure costing up to $65,000. After
    completion of construction, we will pay minimum lease payments,
    which vary based on LIBOR plus a spread (5.77% at April 27,
    2007) on the cost of the facilities. We expect to begin
    making lease payments on the completed buildings in September
    2008 for a term of five years. We have the option to renew the
    lease for two consecutive five-year periods upon approval by
    BNP. Upon expiration (or upon any earlier termination) of the
    lease term, we must elect one of the following options: We may
    (i) purchase the building from BNP for $65,000,
    (ii) if certain conditions are met, arrange for the sale of
    the building by BNP to a third party for an amount equal to at
    least $55,250, and be liable for any deficiency between the net
    proceeds received from the third party and $55,250, or
    (iii) pay BNP a supplemental payment of $55,250, in which
    event we may recoup some or all of such payment by arranging for
    a sale of the building by BNP during the ensuing two-year period.

Both leases also require us to maintain specified financial
    covenants with which we were in compliance as of April 27,
    2007. Such specified financial covenants include a maximum ratio
    of Total Debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation
    and Amortization (“EBITDA”) and a Minimum Unencumbered
    Cash and Short Term Investments.

From time to time, we have committed to purchase various key
    components used in the manufacture of our products. We establish
    accruals for estimated losses on purchased components for which
    we believe it is probable that they will not be utilized in
    future operations. To the extent that such forecasts are not
    achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may change.

In addition, we are subject to various legal proceedings and
    claims which may arise in the normal course of business. While
    the outcome of these legal matters is currently not
    determinable, we do not believe that any current litigation or
    claims will have a material adverse effect on our business, cash
    flow, operating results, or financial condition.

We are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the
    U.S. and several foreign tax jurisdictions. The rights to
    some of our intellectual property (“IP”) are owned by
    certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made
    between foreign and U.S. tax jurisdictions relating to the
    use of this IP. Recently, some other companies have had their
    foreign IP arrangements challenged as part of an examination.
    Our management does not believe, based upon information
    currently known to us that the final resolution of any of our
    audits will have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated
    financial position and the results of operations and cash flows.
    However, if upon the conclusion of these audits the ultimate
    determination of our taxes owed in any of these tax
    jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we
    have recorded or reserved for, our overall effective tax rate
    may be adversely impacted in the period of adjustment.

The General Services Administration (“GSA”) is
    currently auditing our records under the schedule contracts it
    had with us to verify our compliance with various contract
    provisions. If the audit determines that we did not comply with
    such provisions, we may be required to pay the GSA a potential
    settlement. The exact date for completion of the audit and the
    subsequent negotiation process is unknown and may not be
    concluded for some time. Our management does not believe, based
    upon information currently known to us that the final resolution
    of our audit will have a material adverse effect upon our
    consolidated financial position and the results of operations
    and cash flows.

Line of
    Credit

In July 1998, we negotiated a $5,000 unsecured revolving credit
    facility with a domestic commercial bank. Under terms of the
    credit facility, which expires in December 2007, we must
    maintain various financial covenants, with which we are in
    compliance. Any borrowings under this agreement bear interest at
    either LIBOR plus 1% or at

the lender’s “prime” lending rate, such rate
    determined at our discretion. As of April 27, 2007, the
    amounts allocated under the credit facility to support certain
    of our outstanding letters of credit amounted to $2,064.

We also have foreign exchange facilities used for hedging
    arrangements with several banks that allow us to enter into
    foreign exchange contracts of up to $325,000, of which $7,318
    was available at April 27, 2007.

Debt

On March 31, 2006, Network Appliance Global LTD.
    (“Global”), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into
    a loan agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with the
    lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as
    administrative agent. The Loan Agreement provides for a term
    loan available in two tranches, a tranche of $220,000
    (“Tranche A”) and a tranche of $80,000
    (“Tranche B”), for an aggregate borrowing of
    $300,000. The proceeds of the term loan were used to finance a
    2006 dividend from Global to the Company under the American Jobs
    Creation Act. The Tranche A term loan together with accrued
    and unpaid interest are due in full on the maturity date of
    March 31, 2008. During fiscal 2007, we made repayments of
    $214,890 on the term loan. The Tranche A term loan is
    secured by certain investments totaling $116,060 as of
    April 27, 2007, held by Global. The Tranche B term
    loan was fully repaid as of January 26, 2007. Loan
    repayments of $85,110 are due in fiscal 2008.

Interest for the term loan accrues at a floating rate based on
    the base rate in effect from time to time, plus a margin, which
    totaled 5.45% at April 27, 2007.

As of April 27, 2007, Global was in compliance with all
    debt covenants as required by the Loan Agreement.

Stock-Based
    Compensation, Equity Incentive Programs and Stockholders’
    Equity

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Effective April 29, 2006, we adopted
    SFAS No. 123R,

“Share-Based Payments,”

which provides guidance on accounting for stock-based awards
    for employee services. We elected to adopt the modified
    prospective method, and accordingly we were not required to
    restate our prior period financial statements.

Prior
    to the Adoption of SFAS No. 123R

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, stock-based
    compensation expense had not been recognized in our consolidated
    statement of operations, other than those related to
    acquisitions and restricted stock awards. As a result of
    adopting SFAS No. 123R, pretax stock-based
    compensation expense recorded for fiscal 2007 of $163,033 was
    related to employee stock options, restricted stock units
    (“RSUs”), restricted stock awards (“RSAs”),
    and employee stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase
    Plan. Pretax stock-based compensation expense of $13,293 for
    fiscal 2006, which we recorded under APB No. 25, was
    related to RSUs, RSAs, and options assumed from acquisitions.

As a result of adoption of SFAS No. 123R, our income
    from operations and net income for fiscal 2007 were $142,338 and
    $118,078 lower, respectively, than they would have been if we
    had continued to account for share-based compensation under APB
    No. 25. Basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal
    2007, were $0.32 and $0.30 lower, respectively, than they would
    have been if we had continued to account for share-based
    compensation under APB No. 25.

As required by SFAS No. 123R, we eliminated the
    unamortized deferred stock compensation of $49,266 on
    April 29, 2006. Our common stock and additional paid-in
    capital were also reduced by the same amount and had been
    included in the Stockholders’ Equity of our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets as of April 28, 2006.

In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we
    changed our accounting policy of attributing the fair value of
    stock-based compensation to expense from the accelerated
    multiple-option approach provided by APB No. 25, as allowed
    under SFAS No. 123, to the straight-line single-option
    approach. Compensation expense for all stock-based payment
    awards expected to vest that were granted on or prior to
    April 28, 2006 will continue to be recognized using the

    stock-based payment awards expected to vest that were granted
    subsequent to April 28, 2006 is recognized on a
    straight-line basis under the single-option approach.

Income
    Tax Benefits Recorded in Stockholders Equity

For fiscal 2007, the total income tax benefit associated with
    employee stock transactions and recognized in the statement of
    stockholders equity was $175,036. For fiscal 2006, the total
    income tax benefit associated with employee stock transactions
    was $36,596.

Income
    Tax Effects on Statements of Cash Flows

In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, we have presented
    the cash-related tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in
    excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options as
    financing cash flows for fiscal year 2007. Prior to the adoption
    of SFAS No. 123R, tax benefits of stock option
    exercises were presented as operating cash flows. Tax benefits,
    related to tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost
    recognized, of $63,159 presented as financing cash flows for
    fiscal year 2007, would have been classified as operating cash
    flows if we had not adopted SFAS No. 123R.

Equity
    Incentive Programs

Stock Option Plans

— In September 1995, we
    adopted the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan (“the 1995
    Plan”). All outstanding options issued under a previous
    option plan were incorporated into the 1995 Plan upon the
    effectiveness of our initial public offering.

Under the 1995 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant to
    employees, directors, and consultants options to purchase shares
    of our common stock. The 1995 Plan comprises three separate
    equity incentive programs: (i) the Discretionary Option
    Program under which options may be granted to eligible
    individuals at a fixed price per share; (ii) the Salary
    Investment Option Grant Program under which the company’s
    officers and other highly compensated employees may elect to
    have a portion of their base salary reduced in return for stock
    options, and (iii) the Stock Issuance Program under which
    eligible persons may be issued shares of Common Stock directly.
    Options granted under the 1995 Plan generally vest at a rate of
    25% on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date
    and then ratably over the following 36 months. Options
    expire as determined by the Board of Directors, but not more
    than 10 years after the date of grant.

In April 1997, the Board of Directors adopted the Special
    Nonofficer Stock Option Plan (“the Nonofficer Plan”)
    which provides for the grant of options and the issuance of
    common stock under terms substantially the same as those
    provided under the 1995 Plan, except that the Nonofficer Plan
    allows only for the issuance of nonqualified options to
    nonofficer employees.

In August 1999, the Board of Directors adopted the 1999 Stock
    Option Plan (“the 1999 Plan”), which comprises five
    separate equity incentive programs: (i) the Discretionary
    Option Grant Program under which options may be granted to
    eligible individuals during the service period at a fixed price
    per share; (ii) the Stock Appreciation Rights Program under
    which eligible persons may be granted stock appreciation rights
    that allow individuals to



NETWORK
    APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

receive the appreciation in Fair Market Value of the shares;
    (iii) the Stock Issuance Program under which eligible
    individuals may be issued shares of Common Stock directly;
    (iv) the Performance Share and Performance Unit Program
    under which eligible persons may be granted performance shares
    and performance units which result in payment to the participant
    only if performance goals or other vesting criteria are
    achieved; and (v) the Automatic Option Grant Program under
    which nonemployee board members automatically receive option
    grants at designated intervals over their period of board
    service.

The 1999 Plan supplements the existing 1995 Plan and Nonofficer
    Plan, and those plans will continue to remain in full force and
    effect until all available shares have been issued under each
    such plan. However, an Automatic Option Grant Program previously
    in effect under the 1995 Plan terminated as of October 26,
    1999, and all automatic option grants made to nonemployee board
    members on or after that date will be made under the 1999 Plan.

Under the 1999 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant to
    employees, directors, and consultants and other independent
    advisors options to purchase shares of our common stock during
    their period of service with us. The exercise price for an
    incentive stock option and a nonstatutory option cannot be less
    than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the
    grant date. Options granted under the 1999 Plan generally vest
    over a four-year period. Options granted prior to April 29,
    2006, have a term of no more than 10 years after the date
    of grant and those granted after April 29, 2006 have a term
    of no more than seven years, subject to earlier termination upon
    the occurrence of certain events. In fiscal 2004, the 1999 Plan
    was amended to create the Stock Issuance Program, whereby
    eligible individuals may be issued shares of common stock
    directly, either through the issuance or immediate purchase of
    these shares or as a bonus for services rendered. In fiscal
    2005, the 1999 Plan was amended to increase the share reserve by
    an additional 10,200 shares of common stock; to create the
    Stock Appreciation Right Program under which eligible persons
    may be granted stock appreciation rights that allow individuals
    to receive the appreciation in Fair Market Value of the shares;
    to create the Performance Share and Performance Unit Program
    under which eligible persons may be granted performance shares
    and performance units that result in payment to the participant
    only if performance goals or other vesting criteria are
    achieved; and to prohibit the repricing of any outstanding stock
    option or stock appreciation right after it has been granted or
    to cancel any outstanding stock option or stock appreciation
    right and immediately replace it with a new stock option or
    stock appreciation right with a lower exercise price unless
    approved by stockholders. In fiscal 2006, the 1999 Plan was
    amended to increase the share reserve by an additional
    10,600 shares of common stock and limit the number of
    shares that may be issued pursuant to full value awards that may
    be granted under the Stock Issuance Program or the Performance
    Share and Performance Unit Program. In fiscal 2007, the 1999
    Plan was amended to increase the share reserve by an additional
    10,900 shares of common stock and to increase Director
    compensation under the Automatic Option Grant Program from an
    option to purchase 15,000 shares to an option to purchase
    20,000 shares. There have been no repricing to date under
    any of the plans, and no stock appreciation rights have been
    issued.

In fiscal 2007, we assumed two stock option plans in connection
    with our acquisition of Topio (see Note 12.) Under the
    terms of the merger agreement, options and restricted stock
    units to purchase 858 shares were exchanged at certain
    exchange ratios. The options granted under these plans generally
    vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting
    commencement date and then ratably over the following
    36 months. The restricted stock units generally vest at a
    rate of 50% on the first and second annual anniversaries of the
    vesting commencement date.

In fiscal 2006, we assumed various stock option plans in
    connection with our Alacritus and Decru acquisitions. Pursuant
    to the provisions of the merger agreements, outstanding shares
    were exchanged under certain exchange ratios in effect at the
    time of each merger. Options granted under these plans generally
    vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting
    commencement date and then ratably over the following
    36 months. Options expire not more than 10 years after
    the date of grant.

The intrinsic value of stock options represents the difference
    between the exercise price of stock options and the market price
    of our stock on that day for all in-the-money options. The
    weighted-average fair value for the fiscal 2007 grants as of the
    grant date was $12.83. The total intrinsic value of options
    exercised was $267,165, $302,954 and $280,670 for fiscal
    2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. We received $178,241
    $203,977, and $160,656 from the exercise of stock options for
    fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Stock Issuance Program

— Under the 1995 Stock
    Issuance Program, certain eligible persons may be issued shares
    of common stock directly. During fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005,
    125, 210 and 10 shares, respectively, of restricted stock
    awards were issued to certain employees. Prior to the adoption
    of SFAS No. 123R, the exercise price discount from
    fair market value of these shares has been recorded as deferred
    stock compensation expense in fiscal 2006 and 2005, which is
    being amortized ratably over its respective vesting periods,
    between three to four years. After the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R in fiscal 2007, the fair value of these
    grants are recorded as part of the stock-based compensation. At
    April 27, 2007, 1,506 shares were available for future
    issuances under this program.

The following table summarizes our nonvested shares (restricted
    stock awards) as of April 27, 2007:

Although nonvested shares are legally issued, they are

    by the Company when employees terminate their employment. The
    total fair value of shares vested during fiscal 2007 was $3,135.
    There was $47,467 of total unrecognized compensation expense as
    of April 27, 2007, related to restricted stock awards. The
    unrecognized compensation will be amortized over a
    weighted-average period of 3.0 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

— Under the
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), employees are
    entitled to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the
    fair market value at certain specified dates over a two-year
    period. In fiscal 2007, the plan was amended to increase the
    share reserve by an additional 1,600 shares. In fiscal 2006
    and 2005, the plan was amended to increase the share reserve by
    an additional 1,500 and 1,300 shares of common stock,
    respectively. Of the 19,000 shares authorized to be issued
    under this plan, 4,266 shares were available for issuance
    at April 27, 2007; 1,632, 1,575, and 1,598 shares were
    issued in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, at a
    weighted average price of $22.78, $18.28, and $13.30

Stockholders’
    Equity

Preferred Stock

— Our Board of Directors has
    the authority to issue up to 5,000 shares of preferred
    stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences,
    privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, of those
    shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders.

Deferred Stock Compensation

— Prior to adoption
    of SFAS No. 123R in fiscal 2007, deferred stock
    compensation was recorded for the grant of stock awards or
    shares of restricted stock to employees at exercise prices
    deemed to be less than the fair value of our common stock on the
    grant date. Deferred stock compensation was also recorded for
    retention escrow shares withheld in accordance with the merger
    agreement. Deferred stock compensation was adjusted to reflect
    cancellations and forfeitures due to employee terminations as
    they occur. We recorded $29,855 and $1,401 of deferred stock
    compensation in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, primarily
    related to unvested options assumed and retention escrow shares
    withheld in the Spinnaker acquisition, restricted stock awards
    to certain employees, and the grant of stock options below fair
    value to certain highly compensated employees. We reversed
    $2,886 and $1,247 of deferred compensation in fiscal 2006 and
    2005, respectively, due to employee terminations. The reversals
    were primarily related to the forfeiture of unvested options
    assumed in acquisitions as a result of employee terminations.

We recorded $60 and $428 in compensation expense in fiscal 2006
    and 2005, respectively, for the fair value of options granted to
    a member of the Board of Directors in recognition for services
    performed outside of the normal capacity of a board member.
    During fiscal 2002, 100 common shares under the 1995 Plan were
    granted at an exercise price of $15.32 per share, the fair
    market value per share on the grant date. The option has a term
    of 10 years measured from the grant date, subject to
    earlier termination following his cessation of board service,
    and will vest in a series of 48 successive equal monthly
    installments upon his completion of each month of board service
    over the

48-month

period measured from the grant date.

We recorded $13,233, and $7,720 in compensation expense for
    fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, primarily related to the
    amortization of deferred stock compensation from unvested
    options assumed in the Decru, Alacritus, WebManage and Spinnaker
    acquisitions; the retention escrow shares relative to Spinnaker,
    the grant of stock options to certain highly compensated
    employees below fair value at the date of grant and the award of
    restricted stock to certain employees.

As required by SFAS No. 123R, we eliminated the
    unamortized deferred stock compensation of $49,266 on
    April 29, 2006 and reduced our common stock and additional
    paid-in capital by the same amount .

Stock Repurchase Program

— On November 15,
    2006, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase
    program in which up to $800,000 of additional shares may be
    purchased. At April 27, 2007, $399,948 remained available
    for future repurchases. The stock repurchase program may be
    suspended or discontinued at any time.

During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 22,597 shares of our
    common stock at an aggregate cost of $805,708, or a weighted
    average price of $35.66 per share. During fiscal 2006, we
    repurchased 17,430 shares of our common stock at an
    aggregate cost of $488,908, or a weighted average price of
    $28.05 per share. The repurchases were recorded as treasury
    stock and resulted in a reduction of stockholders’ equity.

Current deferred tax assets are $110,741 and $48,496 as of
    fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. Noncurrent net deferred tax
    assets for fiscal 2007 and 2006 are $108,369 and $26,164,
    respectively, and are included in Long Term Deferred Taxes and
    Other Assets within the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We adopted SFAS No. 123R effective the beginning our
    fiscal 2007. Pursuant to the requirements of Footnote 82 of
    SFAS No. 123R, we no longer include unrealized stock
    option attributes as components of our gross deferred tax assets
    and corresponding valuation allowance disclosures. Footnote 82
    is applied on a prospective basis. The tax effected amounts of
    gross unrealized net operating loss and business tax credit
    carryforwards, and their corresponding valuation allowance
    excluded under Footnote 82 for the year ended April 27,
    2007 are $363,303, which will result in additional paid in
    capital if and when realized as a reduction in taxes otherwise
    paid.

The Jobs Act created a one-time incentive for
    U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned
    abroad by providing an 85% dividend-received deduction for
    certain dividends from certain

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

During the fourth quarter of 2006, we incurred a charge of
    approximately $22,482 for federal and state income taxes related
    to the repatriation of approximately $400,000 of accumulated
    income earned by its foreign subsidiaries. As a result of this
    dividend, there were no significant unremitted earnings held by
    our foreign subsidiaries at April 28, 2006. As of our
    fiscal year ended April 27, 2007, the amount of accumulated
    unremitted earnings from our foreign subsidiaries under APB
    No. 23 is approximately $330,000.

During fiscal 2006, our Netherlands subsidiary received a
    favorable tax ruling from the Netherlands tax authorities
    effective May 1, 2005. This new ruling replaced a previous
    Netherlands tax ruling that was scheduled to



NETWORK
    APPLIANCE, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

expire on December 31, 2005. The new ruling results in both
    a lower level of earnings subject to tax in the Netherlands and
    an extension of the expiration date to April 30, 2010.

Network Appliance Systems India Pvt. Ltd. received a tax holiday
    from the Indian tax authorities attributed to its call center
    and research and development activities effective June 6,
    2003. These activities qualify under the Software Technology
    Park of India (“STPI”) scheme for the development and
    manufacture of computer software and information technology
    enabled services. Under this tax holiday, net income derived
    from call center and research and development activities is
    exempt from Indian taxation. This tax holiday will expire on
    December 31, 2009.

As of April 28, 2006, our Netherlands subsidiary had a
    conditional royalty expense carryforward of $51,658 that may
    become available for offset against future Netherlands income.
    The carryforward may not, however, be used to offset income
    under the new Netherlands tax ruling expiring April 30,
    2010. The carryforward does not have an expiration date. We have
    established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset
    for the carryforward based upon our belief that we will not be
    able to utilize this attribute. In the event we are able to
    utilize this attribute, the tax benefit of the carryforward will
    be accounted for as a credit to stockholders’ equity of
    $7,605 and as a reduction to the income tax provision of $5,568.

We have been notified of examinations in the U.S. and
    several foreign tax jurisdictions. The rights to some of our
    intellectual property (“IP”) is owned by certain of
    our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made between
    U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of
    this IP. Recently, some other companies have had their foreign
    IP arrangements challenged as part of an examination. Our
    management does not believe, based upon information currently
    known to us that the final resolution of any of our audits will
    have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial
    position and the results of operations and cash flows.

As of April 27, 2007, the federal and state net operating
    loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately
    $842,021 and $359,989, respectively. The federal net operating
    loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2021. State
    net operating losses of $43,380 will expire in fiscal years 2009
    through 2011, $117,892 will expire in fiscal year 2012 while the
    remaining $198,717 will expire in fiscal years 2013 through 2027.

As of April 27, 2007, we had federal and state tax credit
    carryforwards of approximately $61,855 and $58,513,
    respectively, available to offset future income tax liabilities.
    Federal tax credit carryforwards of $8,035 will begin to expire
    in fiscal years 2009 through 2020, while the remaining $53,820
    will expire in fiscal years beginning 2021. State tax credits of
    $1,513 will expire in fiscal years 2009 through 2012, while the
    remaining $57,000 is available indefinitely to reduce cash taxes
    otherwise payable. As discussed above, most of the net operating
    loss and tax credit carryovers, if realized, will be recognized
    as additional paid in capital in that they are employee stock
    option tax attributes.

During fiscal 2005, we established a valuation allowance against
    certain capital loss carryforwards of approximately $3,468 based
    upon our belief at that time that we would not be able to
    utilize this attribute before expiration starting in fiscal
    2008. However, during fiscal 2007, the sale of NetCache
    generated capital gain income against which the entire capital
    loss carryforward was utilized. As a result, we realized a tax
    benefit for the entire capital loss carryforward through the
    reversal of the valuation allowance originally established
    during fiscal 2005.

During fiscal 2004, as part of our acquisition of Spinnaker, we
    acquired approximately $52,000 and $12,000 of federal and state
    net operating losses, respectively, and $2,700 of federal tax
    credits that were realized as deferred tax assets upon
    acquisition. We also established a valuation allowance of $2,400
    against a portion of the state net operating loss carryforwards
    of Spinnaker which if utilized will be treated as a reduction of
    acquired goodwill.

During fiscal 2006, as part of our acquisition of Alacritus, we
    acquired approximately $6,100 of federal net operating losses
    and $50 of federal tax credits that were realized as deferred
    tax assets upon acquisitions.

During fiscal 2006, as part of our acquisition of Decru, we
    acquired approximately $32,100 of federal net operating losses
    and $1,100 of federal tax credits that were realized as deferred
    tax assets upon acquisition. We also established valuation
    reserves of $1,200 and $1,200 against all of Decru’s state
    net operating loss carryforwards and

state tax credit carryforwards, respectively, that existed as of
    the acquisition date. If utilized, these attributes will be
    treated as a reduction of acquired goodwill.

During fiscal 2007, as part of our acquisition of Topio, we
    acquired approximately $17,900 and $15,400 of federal and state
    net operating losses, respectively, that were realized as
    deferred tax assets upon acquisition.

Segment,
    Geographic, and Customer Information

Under SFAS No. 131,

“Disclosures about
    Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,”

we
    operate in one reportable industry segment: the design,
    manufacturing, marketing, and technical support of
    high-performance networked storage solutions. We market our
    products in the U.S. and in foreign countries through our
    sales personnel and our subsidiaries. The Company’s Chief
    Executive Officer is our Chief Operating Decision Maker
    (“CODM”), as defined by SFAS No. 131. The
    CODM evaluates resource allocation decisions and operational
    performance based upon revenue by geographic regions. Under
    SFAS No. 131, we have one reportable segment, as our
    three geographic operating segments can be aggregated into one
    reportable segment as they have similar operating
    characteristics. For fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, we
    recorded revenue from customers throughout the U.S. and
    Canada, Europe, Latin America, Australia, and Asia Pacific.

The following presents total revenues for the years ended

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, and restricted
    cash and investments reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
    approximate their fair value. Our short-term investments and
    foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value based on
    quoted market prices. Other investments in nonmarketable
    securities are included in other assets at April 27, 2007,
    and April 28, 2006, with total carrying value of $8,932 and
    $11,020, which approximate their fair values. The fair value of
    our debt also approximates its carrying value as of
    April 27, 2007 and April 28, 2006.

We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative
    or trading purposes. We enter into forward foreign exchange and
    currency option contracts to hedge trade and intercompany
    receivables and payables as well as future sales and operating
    expenses against future movement in foreign exchange rates.

Foreign currency forward contracts obligate us to buy or sell
    foreign currencies at a specified future date. Option contracts
    give us the right to buy or sell foreign currencies and are
    exercised only when economically beneficial. As of
    April 27, 2007, we had $367,479 of outstanding foreign
    exchange contracts (including $21,703 of option contracts) as
    indicated below that all had remaining maturities of five months
    or less. As of April 28, 2006, we had $343,454 of
    outstanding foreign exchange contracts (including $17,214 of
    option contracts) that all had remaining maturities of five
    months or less. For the balance sheet hedges, these contracts
    are adjusted to fair value at the end of each month and are
    included in earnings. The premiums paid on the foreign currency
    option contracts are recognized as a reduction to other income
    when the contract is entered into. For cash flow hedges, the
    related gains or losses are included in other comprehensive
    income. Gains and losses on these foreign exchange contracts are
    offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and
    liabilities. At April 27, 2007, and April 28, 2006,
    the estimated notional fair values of forward foreign exchange
    contracts were $368,807 and $345,067, respectively. The fair
    value of foreign exchange contracts is based on prevailing
    financial market information.

Employee
    Benefit and Incentive Compensation Plans

We have established a 401(k) tax-deferred savings plan
    (“Savings Plan”). Employees meeting the eligibility
    requirements, as defined, may contribute specified percentages
    of their salaries. We contributed $10,920, $2,220, and $1,701

All employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the

Business
    Combinations

Acquisition
    of Topio

On December 7, 2006, we acquired Topio, Inc.
    (“Topio”), a privately-held company based in
    Santa Clara, California, that develops and sells
    enterprise-class software for data replication and rapid
    recovery across the spectrum of locations, platforms and storage
    that support an enterprise. The acquisition will continue to
    expand our data protection portfolio and simplify the
    replication of data from other storage arrays to our storage
    systems. Under terms of the agreement, we paid Topio $136,852 in
    cash, assumed approximately 858 stock options with a fair value
    of approximately $8,369. We also incurred $882
    acquisition-related transaction costs and assumed certain
    operating assets and liabilities.

The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of

In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we have preliminarily

    intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on
    their estimated fair values. Goodwill of $114,700 was recorded

    future potential of the Topio technology will enable us to
    expand our data protection portfolio and simplify the
    replication of data from other storage arrays to our storage

    workforce and an existing infrastructure. These opportunities,
    along with the ability to leverage the Topio workforce, were
    significant contributing factors to the establishment of the
    purchase price, resulting in the recognition of a significant
    amount of goodwill. The fair values assigned to tangible and
    intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on
    management estimates and assumptions, and other information
    compiled by management, including third-party valuations that
    utilized established valuation techniques appropriate for the
    high-technology industry. Goodwill recorded as a result of this

    significant.

Because Topio had recently introduced its products, no amount
    was allocated to in-process research and development.

Acquisition
    of Decru

On August 26, 2005, we completed our acquisition of Decru,
    Inc. (“Decru”), a Delaware corporation that develops
    and sells encryption software and appliances which encrypt
    network data. The acquisition resulted in the issuance of
    approximately 8,270 shares of our common stock with a fair
    value of approximately $191,874, approximately 1,907 stock
    options and restricted stock with a fair value of approximately
    $36,142 and the payment of approximately $54,482 in cash (of
    which approximately $34,049 has been placed in escrow to secure
    the Decru stockholders’ indemnification obligations to us
    pursuant to the Merger Agreement), and $711 acquisition-related
    transaction costs, for a total purchase price of approximately
    $283,209. The common stock issued in the acquisition was valued
    at $23.20 per share using a measurement date of August 11,
    2005, in accordance with

EITF 99-12,

The options were valued using the

Of the total purchase price, $5,000 has been allocated to
    in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) and
    was expensed in fiscal 2006. Projects that qualify as IPR&D
    represent those that have not yet reached technological
    feasibility and which have no alternative future use.
    Technological feasibility is established when an enterprise has
    completed all planning, designing, coding, and testing
    activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be
    produced to meet its design specifications including functions,
    features, and technical performance requirement. The value of
    IPR&D was determined by estimating the stage of completion
    and risk associated with IPR&D to determine the level of
    discount rate to be applied, estimating costs to develop the
    purchased IPR&D into

commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash
    flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net
    cash flows to their present value based on the percentage of
    completion of the IPR&D projects.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in fiscal 2007,
    we recorded the intrinsic value, measured as the difference
    between the grant price and fair market value on the acquisition
    consummation date, of unvested options and restricted stock
    units assumed in the Decru acquisition as deferred stock
    compensation in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 44,

“Accounting for Certain Transactions involving Stock
    Compensation.”

Such deferred stock compensation which
    aggregated $18,549 for Decru, is recorded as a separate
    component of stockholders’ equity in the accompanying
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. As required by
    SFAS No. 123R, we eliminated all unamortized deferred
    stock compensation related to the Decru acquisition on
    April 29, 2006.

Acquisition
    of Alacritus

On May 2, 2005, we acquired Alacritus, Inc., a
    privately-held company based in Pleasanton, California, that
    develops and sells disk-based virtual tape library software for
    data protection solutions. The historical operations of
    Alacritus were not significant.

Restructuring
    Charges

In fiscal 2002, as a result of continuing unfavorable economic
    conditions and a reduction in information technology
    (“IT”) spending rates, we implemented two
    restructuring plans, which included reductions in our workforce
    and consolidations of our facilities. As of April 27, 2007,
    we have no outstanding balance in our restructuring liability
    for the first restructuring. The second restructuring related to
    the closure of an engineering facility and consolidation of
    resources to the Sunnyvale headquarters. In fiscal 2006, we
    implemented a third restructuring plan related to the move of
    our global services center operations from Sunnyvale to our new
    flagship support center at our Research Triangle Park facility
    in North Carolina.

Our restructuring estimates are reviewed and revised
    periodically and may result in a substantial charge or reduction
    to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail
    than were anticipated in previous management estimates. Such
    estimates included various assumptions such as the time period
    over which the facilities will be vacant, expected sublease
    terms, and expected sublease rates. In fiscal 2007, we did not
    record any reduction in restructuring reserve resulting from
    change in estimate of our third restructuring plan. In fiscal
    2006, we recorded a reduction in restructuring reserve of $1,256
    resulting from the execution of a new sublease agreement for our
    Tewksbury facility. In fiscal 2006, we also recorded a
    restructuring charge of $1,140, primarily attributed to
    severance-related amounts and relocation expenses related to the
    2006 restructuring plan.

The following analysis sets forth the significant components of
    the restructuring reserve at April 27, 2007, April 28,

Goodwill
    and Purchased Intangible Assets

Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill attributable to each of
    our reporting units is required to be tested for impairment by
    comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its
    carrying value. Our reporting units are the same as our
    operating units. On an ongoing basis, goodwill is reviewed
    annually for impairment (or more frequently if indicators of
    impairment arise). As of April 27, 2007, and April 28,
    2006, respectively, there had been no impairment of goodwill and
    intangible assets. Goodwill balance is summarized as follows:

Guarantees

As of April 27, 2007, our financial guarantees consisted of
    standby letters of credit outstanding, bank guarantee, and
    restricted cash and investments which were related to loan
    collateral, facility lease requirements, service performance
    guarantees, customs and duties guarantees, VAT requirements, and
    workers’ compensation plans. The maximum amount of
    potential future payments under these arrangements was $125,315
    as of April 27, 2007, of which $121,951 was collateralized
    as restricted cash and investments on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets, and $3,364 was amounts outstanding under our commercial
    commitments (see Note 4). The maximum amount of potential
    future payments under these arrangements was $248,719 as of
    April 28, 2006, of which $246,910 was collateralized as
    restricted cash and investment on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets, and $1,809 was amounts outstanding under our commercial
    commitments.

As of April 27, 2007, our notional fair values of foreign
    exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled
    $368,807. We do not believe that these derivatives present
    significant credit risks, because the counterparties to the
    derivatives consist of major financial institutions, and we
    manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any
    one counterparty. We do not enter into derivative financial
    instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Other than the
    risk associated with the financial condition of the
    counterparties, our maximum exposure related to foreign currency
    forward and option contracts is limited to the premiums paid.

We have both recourse and nonrecourse lease financing
    arrangements with third-party leasing companies through
    preexisting relationships with the customers. We sell our
    products directly to the leasing company, and the lease
    arrangement is made between our customer and the leasing
    company. Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally
    three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid
    remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing company in
    the event that any customers default. For these recourse
    arrangements, revenue on the sale of our product to the leasing
    company is deferred and recognized into income as payments to
    the leasing company come due. As of April 27, 2007, and
    April 28, 2006, the maximum recourse exposure under such
    leases totaled approximately $10,262 and $8,443, respectively.
    Under the terms of the nonrecourse leases we do not have any
    continuing obligations or liabilities. To date, we have not
    experienced significant losses under this lease financing
    program.

We enter into standard indemnification agreements in the
    ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, we
    agree to defend and indemnify the other party —
    primarily our customers or business partners or subcontractors
    — for damages and reasonable costs incurred in any
    suit or claim brought against them alleging that



NETWORK
    APPLIANCE, INC.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

our products sold to them infringe any U.S. patent,
    copyright, trade secret, or similar right. If a product becomes
    the subject of an infringement claim, we may, at our option:
    (i) replace the product with another noninfringing product
    that provides substantially similar performance;
    (ii) modify the infringing product so that it no longer
    infringes but remains functionally equivalent; (iii) obtain
    the right for the customer to continue using the product at our
    expense and for the reseller to continue selling the product;
    (iv) take back the infringing product and refund to
    customer the purchase price paid less depreciation amortized on
    a straight-line basis. We have not been required to make
    material payments pursuant to these provisions historically. We
    have not identified any losses that are probable under these
    provisions and, accordingly, we have not recorded a liability
    related to these indemnification provisions.

We have not recorded any liability at April 27, 2007, and
    April 28, 2006, respectively, related to these guarantees
    since the maximum amount of potential future payments under such
    guarantees, indemnities and warranties is not determinable,
    other than as described above.

Divestiture

On September 11, 2006, we completed the sale of certain
    assets of our NetCache product line to Blue Coat Systems Inc.
    (“Blue Coat”) and agreed not to compete in the market
    served by NetCache for a period of no less than three years from
    and after September 11, 2006. We received $23,914 in cash
    and 360 shares of Blue Coat’s common stock with a fair
    value of $4,637 as of September 11, 2006. In addition, we
    accrued $2,032 for costs expected to be incurred to fulfill our
    engineering and service contractual obligations. Because of
    these continuing obligations, the NetCache sale does not qualify
    for presentation as a discontinued operation. As a result of
    this divestiture, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $25,339 in our
    income from operations and a reduction of goodwill of $1,179. We
    recorded revenues of $57,421, $71,106 and $75,482 from NetCache
    products for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 respectively. The
    contribution to operating income from these products was not
    significant.

Subsequent
    Events

On May 24, 2007, we repurchased $200,000 in common shares
    pursuant to our stock repurchase program announced on
    November 15, 2006.

During fiscal 2007, two shareholder derivative lawsuits were
    filed against various of our officers and directors and naming
    us as a nominal defendant. The suits allege improper practices
    relating to the timing of stock option grants. The two cases
    were consolidated into a single consolidated action. On
    June 22, 2007, the parties to the action stipulated to
    voluntarily dismiss the consolidated action without prejudice.
    On June 25, 2007, the Court entered an Order dismissing the
    consolidated action without prejudice.

Controls
    and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls are procedures designed to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under
    the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure Controls are also
    designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and
    communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the
    end of the period covered by this report (the “Evaluation
    Date”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the
    Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective such that the information relating to Network
    Appliance, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to
    be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) reports (i) is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
    rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated
    to Network Appliance’s management, including our principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its
    inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
    may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
    any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
    the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
    in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that,
    as of April 27, 2007, our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of April 27,
    2007, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an
    independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
    their report which is included herein.

(c)

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with
    management’s evaluation during our last fiscal quarter that
    have materially effected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    effect, our internal control over financial reporting.



(d)

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Network Appliance, Inc.

Sunnyvale, California

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting, that Network Appliance, Inc. and
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of April 27,
    2007, based on criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of April 27, 2007, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of April 27, 2007, based on the criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial
    statement schedule as of and for the year ended April 27,
    2007 of the Company and our report dated June 25, 2007
    expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements
    and the financial statement schedule and includes an explanatory
    paragraph relating to the adoption of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),
