greater efficiency and flexibility, our solutions help improve business productivity, performance, and profitability, while providing investment protection and enhanced asset utilization. Our enterprise-class storage solutions are complemented by
our services expertise to enable interoperability and optimization in the context of the application and IT infrastructure within which they are deployed.

Data ONTAP Software

Our fabric-attached storage
(FAS) and V-Series storage solutions are based on Data ONTAP

®

, a highly scalable and flexible operating system
that concurrently supports any mix of storage area network (SAN) and network-attached storage (NAS) environments. This unified storage software platform is compatible with UNIX

®

, Linux

®

, and Web
environments.

The Data ONTAP operating system provides the foundation to build a shared storage infrastructure and an
enterprise-wide data fabric for the full breadth of business applications and data storage and protection requirements. Data ONTAP features scalability, secure multi-tenancy, and unification across protocols and disks. Data ONTAP also unifies
storage efficiency, data management, and data protection. We believe customers can benefit from these capabilities as they increasingly virtualize application environments. Our deduplication for primary and secondary storage, thin provisioning, and
highly efficient hardware help maximize utilization while reducing data center footprint and lowering storage-related power and cooling consumption. A few of the technology features we offer with Data ONTAP include:

•

FlexShare

®

technology, which directs how storage system resources are used to deliver an appropriate level of service for each application;

•

FlexCache

®

technology, which allows performance acceleration through the creation of read-only cached volumes by creating caching volumes on multiple storage controllers;

•

MultiStore

®

software, which allows partitioning of individual physical storage systems into multiple secure and separate logical partitions; and

•

RAID-DP

®

, a
standard Data ONTAP feature that safeguards data from double disk failure. Integrated with our WAFL

®

(Write
Anywhere File Layout) file system, RAID-DP gives customers data protection plus high performance.



Storage Efficiency

NetApp’s portfolio of efficiency technologies helps our customers reduce their storage spending and get more from the storage assets
they already own. Some of the efficiency technologies we offer include:

•

FlexVol

®

technology, which provides for thin provisioning through virtual volumes, enabling storage architectures to be more efficient and achieve higher utilization using flexible volumes that do not require repartitioning of physical storage space;

•

FlexClone

®

technology, which enables true data cloning using logical copies that do not require additional physical storage space and allows for instant replication of data volumes and datasets; and

•

Deduplication technology, which provides the ability to eliminate duplicate data within primary and secondary disk storage environments, resulting in
greater efficiency and higher utilization of storage capacity.

Storage Management and Application
Integration Software

NetApp OnCommand

®

management software improves storage and service efficiency through functions that help customers control, automate, and analyze their shared storage infrastructures.
Our management software family of products provides a broad range of storage and data management tools to simplify IT administration and enhance flexibility and productivity. We deliver differentiated products that support industry open standards
and interfaces to deliver this value to customers. We tightly integrate our software with database and business application software from partners such as Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and VMware in order to optimize the performance of those applications
on our storage systems.

Through data center automation tools, we give customers the ability to monitor service levels, manage
performance, and support change management in complex enterprise SAN environments. We help customers optimize shared infrastructures by supporting individual application performance, service level, and security needs even while the storage is shared
across multiple applications.

FAS Unified Storage Systems Family

The NetApp family of modular, scalable, highly available, unified storage systems supports a full range of data for users on a variety of
platforms. In the same way that server virtualization eliminates the sprawl in the application layer, NetApp’s FAS unified architecture streamlines, simplifies, and consolidates the storage layer. The FAS6200, FAS3200, and FAS2000 series of
fabric-attached storage systems are designed to consolidate all types of storage workloads — including primary and secondary data, as well as structured and unstructured data — across all key OS platforms and network infrastructures. Also,
NetApp unifies storage access for all standard network protocols based on a single HBA technology and standard IP networks. All NetApp FAS systems are interoperable and provide common software services. NetApp provides a data-in-place upgrade path
that spans from entry-level platforms for smaller organizations all the way to high-end data center environments. The NetApp FAS unified architecture supports both scale-up and scale-out growth strategies running the highly efficient Data ONTAP
operating system.

Virtual Storage Tier

Customers can increase the performance of a NetApp storage controller using our virtual storage tiering, which is available with our Flash Cache modular cache expansion. Virtual storage tiering lowers
response times and increases input/output operations of solid state drives without storing additional data on them. Using dynamic storage tiering, it also improves application performance for production workloads residing on any type of disk drive.
Dedupe capabilities reduce the I/O load on storage controllers to provide extreme scaling, especially useful with virtual- and cloud-based working sets.



V-Series Family

Our V-Series family is a network-based virtualization solution that consolidates storage from different suppliers behind our data
management interface, providing SAN and NAS access to the data stored in heterogeneous storage arrays. With the V-Series solution, customers are able to:

•

Transform existing heterogeneous, multivendor storage systems into a single storage pool;

•

Simplify storage provisioning and management with Data ONTAP thin provisioning; and

•

Dramatically lower backup time, space, and cost with Data ONTAP Snapshot

®

copies.

The V-Series
family is compatible with the FAS family of storage systems.

Data Protection Software Products

We offer a broad range of integrated data protection solutions for enterprise customer environments that can be tightly integrated with
application offerings from partners to increase the speed and efficiency of data protection operations:

•

Snapshot technology enables near-instantaneous, space-efficient online backups of large datasets without affecting system performance;

•

SnapRestore

®

technology uses stored Snapshot backups to recover entire file systems or data volumes in seconds, regardless of capacity or number of files;

•

SnapVault

®

and
Open Systems SnapVault technologies provide network- and storage-optimized disk-to-disk backup solutions;

•

MetroCluster™ uniquely combines array-based clustering with synchronous mirroring to deliver continuous availability and zero data loss; and

Data Retention and Archive Products

To meet growing regulatory compliance demands faced by most enterprises, we offer a broad suite of products to help
enable data permanence, accessibility, and privacy across a variety of different regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 21 CFR Part 11, SEC Rule 17a-4, and HIPAA. Cost-effective, resilient, and reliable storage architectures can
be created utilizing NetApp SnapLock

®

products.

Flash Cache

NetApp Flash Cache modules optimize the performance of random read-intensive workloads such as file services and messaging. These intelligent read caches speed access to user data, reducing latency by a
factor of 10 or more compared to disk drives. Faster response times can translate into higher throughput for random I/O workloads. NetApp Flash Cache gives users performance that is comparable to that of solid state disks (SSDs) without the
complexity of another storage tier.

Storage Security Products

Partnering with SafeNet, Inc. enables us to provide a unified platform for data security and key management across IP SAN, NAS, and tape
backup environments. The platform combines wire-speed encryption, access controls, authentication, and automated key management to provide strong security for data at rest, while still allowing the capability to search compliant data for legal
discovery purposes if the need arises. We also partner with Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. to provide advanced fabric services for SANs. These high-speed, highly reliable hardware devices deliver fabric-based encryption services to secure data
assets either selectively or comprehensively.



Object Storage

NetApp StorageGRID

®

is a proven object storage software solution designed to manage petabyte-scale, globally distributed repositories of images, video, and records for enterprises and
service providers. NetApp StorageGRID provides tremendous scalability by eliminating the typical constraints of data containers in blocks and files. It supports billions of files or objects and petabytes of capacity in hybrid cloud storage
architectures with a single global namespace.

NetApp StorageGRID enables intelligent data management and secure content
retention. Data placement and secure content retention are optimized by aligning system and business process management metadata with a global policy engine that manages how data is stored, placed, governed, protected, and retrieved. Content is
protected from tampering using technologies such as digital fingerprints and encryption.

NetApp Services

Our customers demand high availability and reliability of their storage infrastructure to ensure the successful ongoing operation of their
businesses. NetApp’s services are designed with this in mind. We provide professional services, global support solutions, and customer education and training to help customers most effectively manage their data. The professional services and
support solutions we offer help our customers to resolve business problems, reduce costs, keep businesses up and running continuously, comply with regulations and policies, and improve overall operational results. We utilize a global, integrated
model to provide consistent service delivery and global support during every phase of the customer engagement, including assessment and analysis, planning, design, installation, implementation, integration, optimization, ongoing support, and remote
management and monitoring. Services and support often involve phased rollouts, technology transitions and migrations, and other long-term engagements.

Sales, Principal Markets, and Distribution Channels

We market and sell our
products in numerous countries throughout the world, and we continue to make investments in our multiyear branding and awareness campaign to increase visibility of NetApp in the broader IT segment.

Our diversified customer base spans a number of customer segments and vertical markets, including energy, financial services, government,
high technology, Internet, life sciences and healthcare services, major manufacturing, media, entertainment, animation and video postproduction, and telecommunications. We focus primarily on the data management and storage markets, offering an array
of solutions from our high-end products designed for large enterprise customers to entry-level products designed for midsized enterprise customers.

To increase market share, we are focused on diversifying our multichannel distribution strategy. We are strengthening existing partnerships and investing in new partnerships with system integrators and
cloud service providers.

As of the end of fiscal 2011, our worldwide sales and marketing function consisted of 4,808
managers, sales representatives, and technical support personnel. We have field sales offices in more than 40 countries. We employ a multichannel distribution strategy, selling products and services to end users and service providers through a
direct sales force and through channel partners, including value-added resellers, system integrators, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and distributors. During fiscal year 2011, sales through our indirect channels represented 73% of our
total net revenues. Sales to customers Arrow Electronics, Inc. and Avnet, Inc., who are distributors, accounted for approximately 18% and 12% of our net revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2011; approximately 14% and 11% of our net revenues,
respectively, for fiscal 2010; and approximately 11% and 10% of our net revenues, respectively, for fiscal 2009. Information about our segment disclosures, foreign operations, and net sales attributable to our geographic regions is included in
Note 16 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.



Seasonality

We have historically experienced a decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year, as the sales organization spends time developing new business after higher close rates in the fourth
quarter, and because sales to European customers are historically weaker during the summer months. During the second quarter of our fiscal year, we have historically experienced increased sales, driven by the government sector, concurrent with the
end of the U.S. federal government’s fiscal year in September, as well as an increase in business from European markets. We derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter. Bookings and revenues
typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter.

Backlog

We manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers’ demand. Orders are
generally placed by customers on an as-needed basis. A substantial portion of our products is sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancellable prior to shipment without penalty. In certain circumstances, purchase orders are subject
to change with respect to quantity of product or timing of delivery resulting from changes in customer requirements. Our business is characterized by seasonal and intraquarter variability in demand, as well as short lead times and product delivery
schedules. Accordingly, backlog at any given time may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue.

Manufacturing and Supply Chain

We have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties located in Memphis, Tennessee; Olive Branch, Mississippi;
Livingston, Scotland; Schiphol Airport, The Netherlands; Shanghai and Longhua, China; Singapore and Guadalajara, Mexico. These operations include materials procurement, commodity management, component engineering, test engineering, manufacturing
engineering, product assembly, product assurance, quality control, final test, and global logistics. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for materials, as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and
finished systems. We use multiple vendors and have our products manufactured in a number of locations wherever possible to mitigate our supply chain risk. Our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers, exchanging critical
information and implementing joint quality programs. We also use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies to improve our manufacturing continuity of business. This manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investments and
overhead expenditures while creating flexibility for rapid expansion.

We were awarded ISO 9001 certification on May 29,
1997, and continue to be ISO 9001 certified. We were awarded ISO 14001 certification on December 8, 2004, and continue to be ISO 14001 certified.

Research and Development

We conduct research and development activities in
various locations throughout the world. In fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, research and development expenses represented 13%, 14%, and 15% of our net revenues, respectively. These costs relate primarily to personnel and related costs incurred to
conduct product development activities. Although we develop many of our products internally, we may acquire technology through business combinations or through licensing from third parties when appropriate. We believe that technical leadership is
essential to our success, and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development.

Competition

We compete with many companies in the markets we serve, including companies that offer a broad spectrum of IT products and
services and others that offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services. In the primary storage market, our system products and associated software portfolio mainly compete with storage system products and data
management software from Dell, EMC, Hitachi Data Systems,



HP, IBM, and Oracle Corporation. In the secondary storage market, which includes the disk-to-disk backup, archival and compliance, and business continuity segments, our solutions mainly compete
against products from EMC, Hitachi Data Systems, HP, IBM, and Oracle Corporation. In vertical markets — such as content storage, digital media, and graphics — our top competitors include EMC, Hitachi Data Systems, and HP. In the IT
infrastructure and service provider markets, we compete primarily with EMC, Hitachi Data Systems, and HP.

We compete with
these companies based on market presence, breadth of product offerings, breadth of service offerings and price. Some of these companies also compete by offering storage and data management products or services together with other IT products or
services, at minimal or no additional cost, in order to preserve or gain market share.

We believe that we have a number of
competitive advantages over many of these companies, including product innovation, the relationships we have with our customers, the deep integration we do with technology partners, and our collaboration with sales partners. We believe the
advantages of our products include functionality, scalability, performance, flexibility, quality, and operational efficiency. We believe our advantage also includes the nature of the relationships we form with our customers and sales partners
worldwide. We strive to deliver an outstanding experience in every interaction we have with our customers and partners through our product, service, and support offerings, which enable us to provide our customers with a full range of expertise
before, during, and after their purchase from us or from one of our sales partners.

An increase in industry consolidation may
result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties,
including some of our partners. It is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.

Proprietary Rights

We currently rely on a combination
of copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and patents to protect our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our software, documentation, and other written materials under trade secret,
copyright, and patent laws, which afford only limited protection. We have registered our NetApp name and logo, Network Appliance

registered internationally as well. We will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, resellers, customers, and suppliers. We currently have
multiple U.S. and international patent applications pending and multiple U.S. patents issued.

In addition, through
various licensing arrangements, we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others. We expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future, as needed and to the extent available on
reasonable terms and conditions, to support continued development and sales of our products and services. Some of these licensing arrangements require or might require royalty payments and other licensing fees. The amount of these payments and fees
might depend on various factors, including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments; offsetting considerations, if any; and the degree of use of the licensed technology.

The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and
related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights, and we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual
property, we might be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results.



Environmental Disclosure

NetApp is committed to minimizing environmental impact through use of NetApp products, activities, and services. The NetApp environmental management system (EMS) provides the framework for setting,
implementing, and reviewing the company’s environmental objectives and targets. The NetApp EMS supports:

•

Commitment to complying with relevant environmental legislation, regulations, and other customer and community requirements;

•

Prevention of pollution;

•

Conservation of natural resources; and

•

Continual improvement of our environmental management system.

The NetApp EMS makes sure that activities, products, and services conform to the ISO 14001 standard and environmental requirements.

We are voluntarily measuring, monitoring, and publicly reporting our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. We have
established employee commuter programs and education and awareness campaigns, and we continuously seek to optimize the energy efficiency of our buildings, labs, and data centers. At both the global and regional/state levels, various laws and
regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent over time. It is
often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters. Based on current information and subject to the finalization of the proposed regulations, we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is the risk of increased
energy costs. However, we do not anticipate being subject to a cap and trade system or any other mitigation measures that would be material to our operations in the near future. Additionally, we have implemented many disaster recovery and business
resiliency measures to mitigate the physical risks our facilities, business, and supply chain might face as a consequence of severe weather/climate-related phenomena such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, and other such natural occurrences.

We are also subject to other federal, state, and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the
environment. Various international, federal, state, and local provisions regulate the use and discharge of certain hazardous materials used in the manufacture of our products. Failure to comply with environmental regulations in the future could
cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to business interruptions. We believe we are substantially compliant with all applicable environmental laws. All of our products meet the requirements for REACH, WEEE, RoHS, and China RoHS
compliance. We have maintained an environmental management system since December 2004 as well as ISO 14001 certification at our corporate headquarters, which represents approximately 40% of our employee population and is one of the largest
components of our corporate carbon footprint. As part of ISO 14001 requirements, we set environmental performance goals around reducing energy use per square foot as well as waste generated on site (per employee). We also conduct an annual review
and third-party verified audits of our operations, and we monitor environmental legislation and requirements to help make sure we are taking necessary measures to remain in compliance with applicable laws, not only in our operations but also for our
products.

Working Capital Practices

Information about our working capital practices is included in Item 7 — “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” under the
heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and is incorporated herein by reference.



Employees

As of April 29, 2011, we had 10,212 employees, of which 4,808 were in sales and marketing, 3,146 were in research and development, 1,248 were in services and manufacturing operations, and 1,010
were in finance and administration. In addition, we added approximately 1,000 employees as a result of the recent acquisition of ESG, which was completed on May 6, 2011. We have never had a work stoppage and consider relations with our
employees to be good. Competition for technical personnel in the industry in which we compete is intense. We believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate, and retain qualified personnel. To date, we
believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees, but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The
risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Please see Item 1. Business
— Forward Looking Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors
actually occurs, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Our operating results may be adversely affected by uncertain economic and market conditions.

We are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions. Challenging economic conditions worldwide or in certain
geographic regions have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in the computer, storage, and networking industries at large, as well as the information technology (IT) market, resulting in:

•

Reduced demand for our products as a result of constraints on IT-related spending by our customers;

•

Increased price competition for our products from competitors;

•

Deferment of purchases and orders by customers due to budgetary constraints or changes in current or planned utilization of our systems;

•

Risk of excess and obsolete inventories;

•

Risk of supply constraints:

•

Excess facilities costs;

•

Higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenues;



•

Negative impacts from increased financial pressures on customers, distributors and resellers;

•

Negative impacts from increased financial pressures on key suppliers or contract manufacturers; and

•

Potential discontinuance of product lines or businesses and related asset impairments.

Any of the above-mentioned factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business and financial performance.

Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which could adversely impact our common stock price.

We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of
future performance. Our operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations during times of economic
volatility. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

Fluctuations in demand for our products and services, in part due to changes in general economic conditions and specific economic conditions in the
storage and data management market;

•

A shift in federal government spending patterns;

•

Changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers’ spending plans and associated revenues;

•

The level of price and product competition in our target markets;

•

The impact of economic uncertainty on our customers’ budgets and IT spending capacity;

•

Our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments;

•

Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers, and industry consolidation in our supply base, which could subject us to periodic supply-and-demand,
price rigidity, and quality issues with our components;

•

The timing of bookings, the cancellation of significant orders and the management of, or fluctuations in, our backlog;

•

Product configuration and mix;

•

The extent to which our customers renew their service and maintenance contracts with us;

•

Seasonality, such as our historical seasonal decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year and seasonal increase in revenues in the
second quarter of our fiscal year, with the latter due in part to the impact of the U.S. federal government’s September 30 fiscal year end on the timing of its orders;

•

Linearity, such as our historical intraquarter bookings and revenue pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter’s total
bookings and related revenue occur in the last month of the quarter;

•

Announcements and introductions of, and transitions to, new products by us or our competitors;

•

Deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements introduced by us or our competitors;

•

Our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products and enhancements in a timely manner;

•

Our ability to effectively integrate acquired products and technologies;

•

Our levels of expenditure on research and development and sales and marketing programs;

•

Our ability to effectively manage our operating expenses;

•

Adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates in the countries in which we do business;

•

The dilutive impact of our $1.265 billion of 1.75% convertible senior notes due June 2013 (the “Notes”) and related warrants on our
earnings per share;



•

Excess or inadequate facilities;

•

Actual events, circumstances, outcomes and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in determining the values of certain
assets (including the amounts of valuation allowances), liabilities, and other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements;

•

Disruptions resulting from new systems and processes as we continue to enhance and scale our system infrastructure;

•

Disruptions resulting from reliance on third-party systems and processes during the transition period following the completion of mergers or other
acquisitions; and

•

Future accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting rules, such as the increased use of fair value measures, changes in accounting standards
related to revenue recognition, lease accounting, and financial instruments and the potential requirement that U.S. registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Due to such factors, operating results for future periods are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior
results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and
financial condition. It is possible that in one or more quarters our results may fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In such event, the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease.

Our revenues for a particular period are difficult to forecast, and a shortfall in revenues may harm our business and
our operating results.

Our revenues for a particular period are difficult to forecast, especially in times of economic
uncertainty. Because the storage and data management market is rapidly evolving, our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer, and we rely increasingly on sales through our indirect channel partners, including value-added
resellers, systems integrators, distributors, OEMs and strategic business partners. New product introductions and the transition from old to new products also increase the complexities of forecasting revenues.

In addition, we derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter. Bookings typically follow
intra-quarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter. If we do not achieve bookings in the latter part of a quarter consistent with our quarterly targets, our financial results will be adversely impacted. Additionally, due
to the complexities associated with revenue recognition, we may not accurately forecast our non-deferred and deferred revenues, which could adversely impact our results of operations.

We use a “pipeline” system, a common industry practice, to forecast bookings and trends in our business. Sales personnel
monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision, the dollar amount of the sale and the products or services to be sold. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a bookings pipeline.
Our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time, in part because the “conversion rate” of the pipeline into revenues varies from customer to customer, can be difficult to
estimate, and requires management judgment, and also because customers’ purchasing decisions are subject to delay, reduction or cancellation. Small deviations from our forecasted conversion rate may result in inaccurate plans and budgets and
could materially and adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations. In addition, the risks inherent in using a “pipeline” system are magnified with respect to indirect sales made through our channel partners because we
have less control over, and visibility into, the sales process of our channel partners.

Economic uncertainties have caused,
and may in the future again cause, consumers, businesses and governments to defer purchases in response to tighter budgets, credit, decreased cash availability and declining customer confidence. Accordingly, future demand for our products could
differ from our current expectations.



We have experienced periods of alternating growth and decline in revenues and
operating expenses. If we are not able to successfully manage these fluctuations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly impacted.

Changing market conditions and economic uncertainty create a challenging operating environment for our business. It is critical that we
maintain appropriate alignment between our cost structure and our expected growth and revenues, while at the same time, continuing to make strategic investments for future growth.

Our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenues, and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed.
We have a limited ability to quickly or significantly reduce our fixed costs, and if revenue levels are below our expectations, operating results will be adversely impacted. During periods of uneven growth, we may incur costs before we realize the
anticipated related benefits, which could harm our operating results. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in engineering, sales, service and support, marketing programs and other functions to support and grow our
business. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits (revenue growth), and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect,
which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

Conversely, if we are unable to effectively manage
our resources and capacity during periods of increasing demand for our products, we could also experience an adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition and our customer relationships may be adversely impacted. If the
storage and data management market fails to grow, or grows slower than we expect, our revenues will be adversely affected. Also, even if spending in the IT market increases, our revenues may not grow at the same pace.

Our gross margins have varied over time and may continue to vary, and such variation makes it more difficult to forecast our
earnings.

Our total gross margins are impacted by the mix of our product, software entitlements and maintenance and
services revenues.

Our product gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including:

•

Demand for storage and data management products;

•

Pricing actions, rebates, sales initiatives, discount levels, and price competition;

•

Changes in the mix between direct versus indirect and OEM sales, particularly as a result of the recent acquisition of certain assets related to the
Engenio external storage systems business (ESG) of LSI Corporation (LSI), which is based on a lower gross margin OEM business model;

•

Changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including mix of configurations within products;

•

The timing and amount of revenue recognized and deferred;

•

New product introductions and enhancements;

•

Licensing and royalty arrangements;

•

Excess inventory levels or purchase commitments as a result of changes in demand forecasts or last time buy purchases;

•

Possible product and software defects as we transition our products; and

•

The cost of components, contract manufacturing costs, quality, warranty, and freight.



Changes in software entitlements and maintenance gross margins may result from various
factors, such as:

•

The size of the installed base of products under support contracts;

•

The timing of technical support service contract renewals; and

•

Demand for and the timing of delivery of upgrades.

Changes in service gross margins may result from various factors, such as:

•

The mix of customers;

•

The size and timing of service contract renewals;

•

Spares stocking requirements to support new product introductions;

•

The level of spending on our customer support infrastructure;

•

The volume, cost and use of outside partners to deliver support services on our behalf; and

•

Product quality and serviceability issues.

Due to such factors, gross margins are subject to variation from period to period and are difficult to predict.

An increase in competition and industry consolidation could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

The storage and data management markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology. In the storage market, our primary and near-line storage system products and our
associated software portfolio compete primarily with storage system products and data management software from EMC (including its recent acquisition of Isilon), Hitachi Data Systems, HP, IBM, Dell and Oracle Corporation. In the secondary storage
market, which includes the disk-to-disk backup, compliance and business continuity segments, our solutions compete primarily against products from EMC and Oracle Corporation.

There has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving
industry, as companies become unable to maintain their competitive positions or continue operations and as customers demand more flexible business models and terms. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are
better able to compete for customers as sole-source vendors. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish strategic alliances among themselves or with third parties, including some of our partners. It is possible
that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors. Competitive pressures we face could materially and
adversely affect our business and operating results.

Disruption of, or changes in, our distribution model could harm
our sales.

If we fail to develop and maintain strong relationships with our channel partners, or if our channel
partners fail to effectively manage the sale of our products or services on our behalf, our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected.

We market and sell our storage data management solutions directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through channel partners such as value-added resellers, systems integrators,
distributors, OEMs and strategic business partners, and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from these indirect channels. During fiscal 2011, revenues generated from sales through our indirect channel distribution accounted for 73% of
our revenues, and we expect this percentage to continue to increase over time as we further develop these channels or acquire products distributed through indirect channels. In order for us to maintain or increase our revenues, we must effectively
manage our relationships with channel partners.



Several factors could result in disruption of or changes in our indirect channel
distribution model, which could materially harm our revenues and gross margins, including the following:

•

Our indirect channel partners may compete directly with other channel partners or with our direct sales force. Due to these conflicts, our indirect
channel partners could stop or reduce their efforts in marketing our products.

•

Our indirect channel partners may demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear;

•

Our indirect channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes and challenges in business
conditions; and

•

Our indirect channel partners’ financial condition or operations may weaken.

There is no assurance that we will be able to attract new indirect channel partners, retain these indirect channel partners or that we
will be able to secure additional or replacement indirect channel partners in the future, especially in light of changes in end customer demand patterns and changes in available and competing technologies from competitors. The loss of one or more of
our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area could harm our operating results within that area, as qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically requires a significant investment of time and resources before
acceptable levels of productivity are met. Our inability to effectively establish, train, retain and manage our indirect channel partners could harm our sales.

In addition, we depend on our indirect channel partners to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Their failure to do so could have a material adverse
effect on our revenues and operating results.

Our OEM relationship with IBM may not continue to generate significant
revenues.

In April 2005, we entered into an OEM agreement with IBM, which enables IBM to sell
IBM-branded solutions based on our unified solutions, including NearStore

®

and V-Series systems, as well as
associated software offerings. In addition, by acquiring ESG, we have assumed LSI’s rights under a second OEM agreement with IBM, which enables IBM to sell certain ESG solutions. While these agreements are part of our general strategy to expand
our reach to more customers and into more countries, we do not have an exclusive relationship with IBM under either OEM agreement, and there is no minimum commitment for any given period of time. Therefore, our relationship with IBM may not continue
to generate significant revenues or, in the case of the OEM agreement related to ESG, may not allow us to capture certain anticipated benefits of the ESG acquisition. In addition, we have no control over the products that IBM selects to sell, or its
release schedule and timing of those products; nor do we control its pricing.

In the event that sales through our OEM
relationship with IBM increase, which we expect will occur as a result of the ESG transaction, we may experience distribution channel conflicts between our direct sales force and the OEM or among our channel partners. If we fail to minimize channel
conflicts, or if our OEM relationship does not continue to generate significant revenues, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.

A portion of our revenues is generated by large, recurring purchases from various customers, resellers and distributors. A loss, cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has and in
the future could negatively affect our revenues.

During fiscal 2011, sales to distributors Arrow Electronics, Inc. and
Avnet, Inc. accounted for approximately 18% and 12%, respectively of our net revenues. We also have significant OEM agreements with IBM, which, as described above, enable IBM to sell IBM-branded solutions based on our solutions, as well as an
agreement with Fujitsu Technology Solutions (Fujitsu), which enables Fujitsu to lease, sell, market and resell our



products to end users and Fujitsu sales partners worldwide, to integrate our products into Fujitsu bundled offerings, and to market our support services. The loss of orders from these, or any of
our more significant customers, strategic partners, distributors or resellers could cause our revenues and profitability to suffer.

We generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers for an extended period of time, and thus we may not be able to continue to receive large, recurring orders from these
customers, resellers or distributors. For example, our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases and our customers, resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time.

Unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact our operations by affecting the solvency of our customers, resellers and
distributors, or the ability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products. If the uncertainty in the economy continues, or conditions deteriorate, and our sales decline, our financial condition and operating results could
be adversely impacted.

Because our expenses are based on our revenue forecasts, a substantial reduction or delay in sales of
our products to, or unexpected returns from customers and resellers, or the loss of any significant customer or reseller, could harm our business. We expect that our largest customers in the future could be different from our largest customers
today. End users could stop purchasing and indirect channel partners could stop marketing our products at any time. The loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter
could harm our operating results. In addition, a change in the pricing practices of one or more of our large indirect channel partners could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins.

The U.S. government has contributed to our revenue growth and has become an important customer for us. Future revenues from the
U.S. government are subject to shifts in government spending patterns. A decrease in government demand for our products could materially affect our revenues. In addition, our business could be adversely affected as a result of future examinations by
the U.S. government.

The U.S. government has become an important customer for the storage and data management
market generally and for us in particular; however, government demand is unpredictable, and there can be no assurance that we will maintain or grow our revenues from the U.S. government. Government agencies are subject to budgetary processes
and expenditure constraints that could lead to delays or decreased capital expenditures in IT spending. If the government or individual agencies within the government reduce or shift their capital spending patterns, our revenues and operating
results may be harmed.

In addition, selling our products to the U.S. government, whether directly or indirectly, also
subjects us to certain regulatory requirements. For example, in April 2009, we entered into a settlement agreement with the United States of America, acting through the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and on behalf of the General Services
Administration (the “GSA”) related to a dispute regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of GSA contracts for certain specified prior years. Failure to comply with U.S. government
regulatory requirements by us or our reseller partners could subject us to fines and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and financial position.

If we are unable to maintain our existing relationships and develop new relationships with major strategic partners, our revenues
may be impacted negatively.

An element of our strategy to increase revenues is to strategically partner with major
third-party software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also co-market our products with them. We have significant partner relationships with database, business application, backup management and server
virtualization companies, including Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Symantec and VMware. In January 2010, we announced an expansion of our collaboration with Cisco and VMware, including a cooperative support arrangement, and in October 2010, we expanded our
relationship with Fujitsu Technology Solutions. A number



of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management market. There is intense competition for attractive strategic
partners, and even if we can establish relationships with these or other partners, these partnerships may not generate significant revenues or may not continue to be in effect for any specific period of time. If these relationships are not
maintained or fail to materialize as expected, we could experience lower than expected revenue growth, suffer delays in product development, or experience other operational difficulties.

In addition, some of our partners, including Oracle, Cisco and VMware, are also partnering with other storage vendors which may increase
the availability of competing solutions, harm our ability to continue as the vendor of choice for those partners and harm our ability to grow our business with those partners.

We intend to continue to establish and maintain business relationships with technology companies to expand our marketing reach and accelerate the development of our storage and data management solutions.
To the extent that we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships or maintaining our existing relationships, our future revenues and operating results could be negatively impacted. In addition, the loss of a strategic partner could have a
material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.

Our future financial performance depends on growth in
the storage and data management markets. If the performance of these markets does not meet the expectations upon which we calculate and forecast our revenues, our operating results will be materially and adversely impacted.

All of our products address the storage and data management markets. Accordingly, our future financial performance will depend in large
part on continued growth in the storage and data management markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging standards in these markets. The markets for storage and data management have been recently adversely impacted by the global economic
uncertainty, and as a result of continued uncertainty, the markets may not grow as anticipated or may decline.

Additionally, emerging standards in these markets may adversely affect the
UNIX

®

, Windows

®

and the World Wide Web server markets upon which we depend. For example, we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial
services, healthcare, pharmaceutical and government market segments, industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access, reliability and permanence (such as Rule 17(a)(4) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate. If our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard, customers in these market and
geographical segments will not purchase our products, and we will not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted.

Supply chain issues, including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers, or a shortage of adequate
component supply or manufacturing capacity that increases our costs or causes a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly
may result in excess or obsolete component supply, which could adversely affect our gross margins.

The fact that we do
not own or operate our manufacturing facilities and supply chain exposes us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, production costs and product supply, which could have a material adverse impact on the supply of our products and
on our business and operating results. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for components utilized in the assembly of our products, which has and could subject us to future periodic supply constraints and price rigidity. In addition, pursuant
to the terms of the asset purchase agreement we entered into with LSI in connection with the acquisition of certain assets related to ESG, we have the right to place orders with contract manufacturers and suppliers through LSI and access LSI’s
systems in order to help us manage the ESG business for a period of time following the acquisition. Financial problems of either contract manufacturers, component suppliers or other parties in our supply chain, including LSI, and reservation



of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies, inside or outside of our industry, could either limit supply or increase costs of our products. Qualifying a new
contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time-consuming, and disruption or termination of manufacturing capacity with respect to any contract manufacturer could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and sell our
products.

We intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements, which will require us to rapidly achieve
volume production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and suppliers. A reduction or interruption in supply; a significant increase in the price of one or more components; a failure to adequately procure inventory by our contract
manufacturers; a failure to timely cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and
could materially damage customer relationships. Furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market. In the
event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used, our gross margins could decrease. As the demand for our products has increased, we have experienced, and may
continue to experience tightening of supply of some components leading to longer lead times and component supply constraints, which has resulted in and in the future could continue to result in the delay of shipments.

Our business operations are subject to business interruptions and other events beyond our control. Such events could make it difficult or
impossible for us to receive components from our suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain.

Our acquisitions may disrupt our existing business and harm our results of operations.

As part of our strategy, we are continuously evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our
current products, expand the breadth of our markets, or enhance our technical capabilities. In fiscal year 2011, we completed acquisitions of two technology companies, and on May 6, 2011, we completed the acquisition of certain assets related
to ESG. The acquisition and ongoing integration of new businesses into our business may adversely affect our operations or profitability. We may not achieve the anticipated cost savings and synergies or realize our estimated revenue, gross margin,
profit or other financial projections or business objectives in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors, including the following:

•

The inability to successfully integrate the operations, technologies, products, personnel and business systems of the acquired companies;

•

In the case of an asset purchase, the failure to acquire all of the assets necessary to operate the acquired business;

•

The diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the existing business;

•

The loss of key employees of the acquired business could adversely impact our ability to manage the business and our ability to realize our financial
forecasts;

•

The inability to retain the customers and partners of acquired businesses following the acquisition;

•

Substantial transaction costs and accounting charges; and

•

Exposure to litigation related to acquisitions.

Acquisitions may also result in risks to our existing business, including:

•

Deterioration of our internal control over financial reporting as a result of inconsistencies between our standards, procedures and policies and those
of the acquired business;

•

Reliance on the selling party’s processes, data, supply chain management and reporting during the transition period following the completion of an
acquisition;



•

Dilution of our current stockholders’ percentage ownership to the extent we issue new equity;

•

Assumption of additional liabilities;

•

Incurrence of additional debt or a decline in available cash;

•

Adverse effects to our financial statements, such as the need to incur restructuring charges;

•

Liability for intellectual property infringement and other litigation claims, which we may or may not be aware of at the time of acquisition; and

•

Creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense or impairment charges.

The failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may also result in impairment charges for
goodwill and purchased intangible assets. For example, we have in the past discontinued certain products which were originally acquired through business acquisitions. Additional or realized risks of this nature could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are exposed to the credit and non-payment risk of
our customers, resellers, and distributors, especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets, which could result in material losses.

Most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days. While we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements,
and seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe are reasonable, we may experience losses due to a customer’s inability to pay.

Beyond our open credit arrangements, we also have recourse and nonrecourse customer financing leasing arrangements using third-party leasing companies. Under the terms of recourse leases, which are
treated as off-balance sheet arrangements, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing company in the event of end-user customer default.

We also offer financing arrangements whereby the end-user customer pays a fixed monthly amount plus a variable amount based on actual
storage capacity used. These arrangements subject us to additional risk with respect to revenue recognition and profitability due to the uncertainties associated with the variable portion of the arrangements. In addition, from time to time we
provide guarantees for a portion of other financing arrangements under which we could be called upon to make payments to our funding parties in the event of nonpayment by end-user customers.

We expect demand for customer financing to continue. During periods of economic uncertainty, our exposure to credit risks from our
customers increases. In addition, our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions.

In the past, there have been bankruptcies by our customers to whom we had extended open credit or provided lease financing arrangements,
causing us to incur bad debt charges, and, in the case of financing arrangements, a loss of revenues. We may be subject to similar losses in future periods. Any future losses could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our
operating results and financial condition. Additionally, to the extent that the recent turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for customers to obtain open credit or lease financing, those customers’ ability to purchase our
products could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.



The market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and
will likely continue to do so in the future.

The market price for our common stock has experienced substantial
volatility in the past, and several factors could cause substantial fluctuation in the future. These factors include but are not limited to:

•

Fluctuations in our operating results compared to prior periods and forecasts;

•

Variations between our operating results and either the guidance we have furnished to the public or the published expectations of securities analysts;

•

Industry consolidation and the resulting perception of increased competition;

•

Economic developments in the storage and data management market as a whole;

•

Fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;

•

Changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections;

•

Changes in our relationships with our suppliers, customers, channel and strategic partners;

•

Announcements of the completion or dissolution of strategic alliances within the industry;

•

Dilutive impacts of our convertible Notes and related warrants;

•

International conflicts and acts of terrorism;

•

Announcements of new products, applications, or product enhancements by us or our competitors;

•

Announcements related to planned or completed mergers or other acquisitions by us or our competitors;

•

Inquiries by the SEC, NASDAQ, law enforcement, or other regulatory bodies; and

•

General market conditions, including recent global or regional economic uncertainties.

In addition, the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of the equity securities of
many technology companies. Certain macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates, the market climate for the technology sector, and levels of corporate spending on IT, could continue to have an impact on the trading price of our stock, and
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future.

Changes in market conditions have led,
and in the future could lead, to charges related to the discontinuance of certain of our products and asset impairments.

In response to changes in economic conditions and market demands, we may decide to strategically realign our resources and consider cost
containment measures including restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise discontinuing certain products. Any decision to limit investment in, dispose of, or otherwise exit products may result in the recording of charges to earnings, including
inventory and technology-related or other intangible asset write-offs, workforce reduction costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities, cancellation penalties or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued
products, which would harm our operating results. Our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and
decisions. Additionally, we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis, and between annual tests in certain circumstances when impairment indicators exist or if certain events or changes in circumstances have occurred.
Future goodwill impairment tests may result in charges to earnings, which could materially harm our operating results.



If we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological
change, if our new products do not achieve market acceptance, if we fail to manage the interoperability and transition between our new and old products, or if we cannot provide the expected level of service and support for our new products, our
operating results could be materially and adversely affected.

Our future growth depends upon the successful
development and introduction of new hardware and software products. Due to the complexity of storage subsystems and storage security appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products, such products are
subject to significant technical risks. In addition, our new products must respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new products in a timely
manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, or if such products do not achieve market acceptance, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. New or additional product introductions increase the
complexities of forecasting revenues, and subject us to additional financial and operational risks. If they are not managed effectively, we could experience material risks to our operations, financial condition and business model.

As new or enhanced products are introduced, we must attempt to successfully manage the interoperability and transition from older
products in order to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories, and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers’ demands.

As we enter new or emerging markets, we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to
additional competition. We may not be able to provide products, service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities.

Due to the global nature of our business, risks inherent in our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Although a substantial portion of our business is located and conducted in the United States, a significant portion of our operations are
located, and a significant portion of our revenues are derived, outside of the United States. During fiscal 2011, our international revenues accounted for 49% of our total revenues. A substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside of
the U.S., and we have research and development and service centers overseas. Accordingly, our business and our future operating results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors affecting our international operations, some of which are
beyond our control, including regulatory, political, or economic conditions in a specific country or region, trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements, government spending patterns, and acts of terrorism and international
conflicts. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products.

We face
exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results
and cash flows. Our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and in foreign currencies. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially
less competitive in foreign markets. Conversely, lowering our price in local currency may result in lower U.S.-based revenues. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase operating expenses in
foreign markets. Additionally, we have exposures to emerging market currencies, which can experience extreme volatility. We utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure associated with certain assets and liabilities as
well as anticipated foreign currency cash flows on a short-term basis. All balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every quarter. The time-value component of our cash flow hedges is recorded in earnings while all other gains and
losses are marked to market through other comprehensive income until forecasted transactions occur, at which time such realized gains and losses are recognized in earnings. These hedges attempt to reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the
impact of currency exchange movements. Factors that could have a



negative impact on the effectiveness of our hedging program include inaccuracies in forecasting, widening interest rate differentials, and volatility in the foreign exchange market. Our hedging
strategies may not be successful and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

Additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include, among others, longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations.

In addition, due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the
United States and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products, including antitrust and anti-competition laws, rules and regulations, general import/export restrictions, and regulations related to data privacy. For example,
United States Government export restrictions impede our ability to sell our products to certain end users. The United States, through the Bureau of Industry Security, places restrictions on the export of certain encryption technology. These
restrictions may include: the requirement to have a license to export the technology; the requirement to have software licenses approved before export is allowed; and outright bans on the licensing of certain encryption technology to particular end
users or to all end users in a particular country. Our products are subject to various levels of export restrictions. These export restrictions could negatively impact our business. We are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary
information due to piracy, misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than U.S. laws. Such factors could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial position.

Moreover, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that
are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures, or U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. There can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies
to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will comply with these policies, procedures, laws and/or regulations. Any such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations.

Changes in our effective tax rate or adverse outcomes resulting
from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results.

Our effective tax rate could be
adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:

•

Earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are taxed at lower rates as compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate;

•

Material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates as a result of a shift in the mix of pretax profits and losses by tax jurisdiction, our
ability to use tax credits, or effective tax rates by tax jurisdiction that differ from our estimates;

•

Changing tax laws or related interpretations, accounting standards, regulations, and interpretations in multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate,
as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings;

•

An increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including certain stock-based compensation expense, write-offs of acquired in-process research
and development, and impairment of goodwill;

•

The tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods;

•

Changes related to our ability to ultimately realize future benefits attributed to our deferred tax assets, including those related to
other-than-temporary impairments;

•

Tax assessments resulting from income tax audits or any related tax interest or penalties could significantly affect our income tax provision for the
period in which the settlements take place; and

•

A change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings.



We receive significant tax benefits from sales to our non-U.S. customers. These
benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the United States and in the countries in which our international operations are located. Future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations could adversely affect
our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits. We have not provided for United States federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The
Obama administration and Congress have announced several proposals to reform United States tax rules, including proposals that may result in a reduction or elimination of the deferral of United States income tax on our future unrepatriated earnings.
Should such anti-deferral provisions be enacted, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected.

We are currently
undergoing federal income tax audits in the United States and several foreign tax jurisdictions. The rights to some of our intellectual property (IP) are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made between U.S. and
foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this IP in a qualified cost sharing arrangement. In recent years, several other U.S. companies have had their foreign IP arrangements challenged as part of IRS examinations, which has resulted in
material proposed assessments and/or litigation with respect to those companies.

During fiscal year 2009, we received Notices
of Proposed Adjustments from the IRS in connection with a federal income tax audit of our fiscal 2003 and 2004 tax returns. We filed a protest with the IRS in response to the Notices of Proposed Adjustments and subsequently received a rebuttal from
the IRS examination team in response to our protest. In April 2011, we executed a closing agreement with the IRS Appeals Office to close this examination. The Notices of Proposed Adjustments in this audit focused primarily on issues relating to the
timing and the amount of income recognized, deductions taken and on the level of cost allocations made to foreign operations during the audit years. The settlement of our 2003-2004 IRS examination resulted in additional liability of $10.8 million,
which is almost entirely offset by net operating loss carryforwards. As a result of the examination settlement, we have reduced our reserve for uncertain tax positions and recognized a net benefit of $21.1 million.

During fiscal year 2010, the IRS commenced the examination of our fiscal 2005 through 2007 federal income tax returns, and in addition,
the California Franchise Tax Board began the examination of our fiscal 2007 and 2008 California income tax returns. These audits are currently in progress.

On September 17, 2010, the Danish tax authorities issued a decision concluding that distributions declared in 2005 and 2006 from the Company’s Danish subsidiary, for which the Company has not
paid or accrued any taxes, are subject to Danish at-source dividend withholding tax. The Company has appealed this assessment decision with the Danish National Tax Tribunal.

If the ultimate determination of income taxes or at-source withholding taxes assessed under the current IRS audits or under audits being conducted in any of the other tax jurisdictions in which we operate
results in an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Our international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the Netherlands which expires on April 30, 2015 and results in a lower level of earnings subject to tax in the
Netherlands. If we are unable to negotiate a similar tax ruling upon expiration of the current ruling, our effective tax rate could increase and our operating results could be adversely affected. Our effective tax rate could also be adversely
affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations, which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole. Our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in
international operations and how the operations are managed and structured. The price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate.



Our leverage and debt service obligations and note conversion may adversely affect our
financial condition, results of operations and earnings per share.

As a result of the sale of our Notes, we have a
greater amount of debt than we have maintained in the past. In addition, we have various synthetic lease arrangements related to some of our facilities at our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, and, subject to the restrictions in our
existing and any future financing agreements, we may incur additional debt. Our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including:

•

Impacting our ability to satisfy our obligations;

•

Increasing the portion of our cash flows from operations that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for
operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;

•

Impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future;

•

Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and

•

Making us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.

Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial,
business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Furthermore, our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet
our expenses and service our debt. As a result, we may be required to repatriate funds from our foreign subsidiaries which could result in a significant tax liability to us. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or if
we are unable to repatriate sufficient or any funds from our foreign subsidiaries, in order to meet our expenses and debt service obligations, we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds, or we may be required
to raise additional funds through other means. If we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding is available, obtain it on acceptable terms. If we fail to make a
payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt, and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness.

Any conversion of our Notes may cause dilution to our shareholders and to our earnings per share. If the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price, initially $31.85 per share, the Notes will
cause an increase in diluted share count and result in lower reported earnings per share. For at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended March 31, 2011, our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price
of $41.41 per share set forth for these Notes. Accordingly, the Notes are convertible at the holder’s option through June 30, 2011. Based on the trading price of our common stock on April 29, 2011, we had approximately 16 million
shares of common stock potentially issuable on conversion of our Notes. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of
the Notes, shares of our common stock, which would result in dilution to our shareholders.

The Note hedges and warrant
transactions that we entered into in connection with the sale of the Notes may affect the trading price of our common stock.

In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into privately negotiated convertible Note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties (the Counterparties), which are expected to offset
the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes. At the same time, we also entered into warrant transactions with the Counterparties pursuant to which we may issue shares of our common stock above a certain strike price.
In connection with these hedging transactions, the Counterparties may have entered into various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or purchased shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions at or
following the pricing of the Notes. Such activities may have had the effect of increasing the price of our common stock. The Counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions



from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the Notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock or entering into other derivative transactions. Additionally, these
transactions may expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance. The effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the Notes will depend, in part, on market conditions and cannot be
ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock. In addition, if our stock price exceeds the strike price for the warrants, there could be additional dilution to our shareholders, which
could adversely affect the value of our common stock.

In April 2010, we terminated our Note hedge transaction with Lehman
Brothers OTC Derivatives, Inc. (Lehman OTC), which was a counterparty to 20% of our Note hedges, as a result of the bankruptcy filing by Lehman OTC, which constituted an event of default under the Note hedge. Because we have decided not to replace
this Note hedge, we are subject to potential dilution on the unhedged portion of our Notes upon conversion if on the date of conversion the per-share market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of $31.85. The terms of the Notes,
the rights of the holders of the Notes and other counterparties to Note hedges and warrants were not affected by the termination of this Note hedge.

The price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the Notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or
arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock by holders of the Notes. The hedging or arbitrage could, in turn, affect the trading price of the Notes and warrants.

Future issuances of common stock related to our Notes, warrants, stock options, restricted stock units, and our Employee Stock
Purchase Plan may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the Notes.

The conversion of some or all
of our outstanding Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the Notes. For at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended March 30, 2011,
our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price of $41.41 per share set forth for these Notes. Accordingly, the Notes are convertible at the holder’s option through June 30, 2011. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will
satisfy our obligation by delivering cash for the principal amount of the Notes and shares of common stock, if any, to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount. Any new issuance of equity securities, including the issuance of
shares upon conversion of the Notes or the exercise of related warrants which are not offset by our Note hedges, could dilute the interests of our then-existing stockholders, including holders who receive shares upon conversion of their Notes, and
could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock and the Notes. In addition, any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon such conversion or the exercise of warrants could adversely affect prevailing market
prices of our common stock.

As of April 29, 2011, eligible individuals under our stock option and restricted stock unit
plans held options to purchase approximately 25 million shares of our common stock and a total of approximately 10 million restricted stock units, respectively. If all the outstanding options were exercised, the proceeds to the Company
would average approximately $27 per share. We also had 14 million shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our stock plans with respect to equity awards that have not been granted. The exercise of all of the outstanding options
and/or the vesting of all outstanding restricted shares and restricted stock units would dilute the interests of our then-existing stockholders, and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such exercise could adversely
affect the trading price of our common stock.

In addition, we have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) under which
employees are entitled to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the fair market value at certain specified dates over a two-year period. As of April 29, 2011, we had approximately 4 million shares of our common stock available for
issuance under the ESPP. The issuance of shares under the ESPP would dilute the interests of our then-existing stockholders, and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such exercise could adversely affect the trading price
of our common stock.



We may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance
our operations related to business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic alliances or other transactions), to increase our capital, to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of
outstanding warrants or options upon conversion of the Notes, or for other reasons.

We are exposed to fluctuations in
the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our financial results.

At April 29, 2011, we had $5.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities and restricted cash and investments. We invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments,
consisting principally of investments in U.S. Treasury securities, commercial paper, U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, certificates of deposit, and money market funds. These investments are subject to general credit,
liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which have been exacerbated by unusual events such as the financial and credit crisis, and bankruptcy filings in the United States which have affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to
global credit and liquidity issues. These securities are generally classified as “available-for-sale” and, consequently, are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.

Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest
earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest
rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates. Currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We may suffer losses if
forced to sell securities that have experienced a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates. Currently, we do not use financial derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure.

The fair value of our investments may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets. Any investment
securities that we hold or the issues comprising such securities could be subject to review for possible downgrade. Any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our investments. Changes in
the various assumptions used to value these securities and any increase in the markets’ perceived risk associated with such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair value.

On occasion, we make strategic investments in other companies, including private equity funds, which may decline in value and/or not meet
desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control. As of April 29, 2011, we had an investment with the carrying value of $1.3 million in a private equity fund.

In the event of adverse conditions in the credit and capital markets, our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could
determine that some or all of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment, which could adversely impact our financial position and operating results.

A significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents balances are held overseas. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash
domestically in order to fund our U.S. operations and strategic opportunities, and to service our debt, we may incur a significant tax liability in order to repatriate the overseas cash balances, or we may need to raise additional capital in the
future.

A portion of our earnings which is generated from our international operations is held and invested by certain
of our foreign subsidiaries. These amounts are not freely available for dividend repatriation to the United States without triggering significant adverse tax consequences. As a result, if the cash generated by our domestic operations is not
sufficient to fund our domestic operations, our broader corporate initiatives such as stock repurchases, acquisitions, and other strategic opportunities, and to service our outstanding indebtedness, we may



need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings, or we may need to obtain new credit facilities to the extent we choose not to repatriate our overseas cash.
Such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all, and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership. Furthermore, lenders, particularly in light of the current
challenges in the credit markets, may not agree to extend us new, additional or continuing credit. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may be forced to repatriate our foreign cash and incur a significant
tax expense or we may not be able to take advantage of strategic opportunities, develop new products, respond to competitive pressures or repay our outstanding indebtedness. In any such case, our business, operating results or financial condition
could be adversely impacted.

Our synthetic leases are off-balance sheet arrangements that could negatively affect our
financial condition and operating results. We have invested substantial resources in new facilities and physical infrastructure, which will increase our fixed costs. Our operating results could be harmed if our business does not grow proportionately
to our increase in fixed costs.

We have various synthetic lease arrangements with BNP Paribas Leasing Corporation as
lessor (BNPPLC) for our headquarters office buildings and land in Sunnyvale, California. These synthetic leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under the accounting guidance for leases and are not considered variable interest
entities under applicable accounting guidance. Therefore, we do not include the properties or the associated debt on our consolidated balance sheets.

Our future minimum lease payments under these synthetic leases limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business by restricting the funds available for use in addressing such
changes. If we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately to our increase in fixed costs, our operating results will be harmed. If we elect not to purchase the properties at the end of the lease term, we have guaranteed a minimum
residual value to BNPPLC. If the fair value of the properties declines below that guaranteed minimum residual value, our residual value guarantee would require us to pay the difference to BNPPLC. As of April 29, 2011, the estimated fair value
of the properties was approximately $35.8 million below the guaranteed minimum residual value, which we are accruing over the remaining term of the respective leases. Any further decline in the fair value of the properties could adversely
impact our cash flows, financial condition and operating results.

As a result of excess capacity in our Sunnyvale facilities,
certain of our facilities subject to synthetic lease arrangements have been subleased or are vacant. These subleases will expire at various times through 2015 and some are at terms that do not generate sufficient sublease income to cover the
carrying costs of these facilities. In addition, we may experience changes in our operations in the future that could result in additional excess capacity and vacant facilities. We will continue to be responsible for all carrying costs of these
facilities under operating leases until such time as we can sublease these facilities or terminate the applicable leases based on the contractual terms of the operating lease agreements, and these costs may have an adverse effect on our business,
operating results and financial condition.

We are subject to restrictive and financial covenants in our synthetic lease
arrangements. The restrictive covenants may restrict our ability to operate our business.

Our ongoing extension of
credit under our synthetic lease arrangements are subject to continued compliance with financial covenants. If we do not comply with these restrictive and financial covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements, we may be required to repay
any outstanding amounts or repurchase the properties which are subject to the synthetic lease arrangements. If we lose access to the synthetic lease arrangements, we may not be able to obtain alternative financing on acceptable terms, which could
limit our operating flexibility.

The agreements governing our synthetic lease arrangements contain restrictive covenants that
limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our ability to:

•

Incur indebtedness;



•

Incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level;

•

Grant liens;

•

Sell all or substantially all our assets:

•

Enter into certain mergers;

•

Change our business;

•

Enter into swap agreements;

•

Enter into transactions with our affiliates; and

•

Enter into certain restrictive agreements.

As a result of these restrictive covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be restricted. We may also be prevented
from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, such as strategic acquisitions or joint ventures.

Our
failure to comply with the restrictive and financial covenants could result in a default under our synthetic lease arrangements, which would give the counterparties thereto the ability to exercise certain rights, including the right to accelerate
the amounts owed thereunder and to terminate the arrangements. In addition, our failure to comply with these covenants and the acceleration of amounts owed under synthetic lease arrangements could result in a default under the Notes, which could
permit the holders to accelerate the Notes. If all of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt.

We have credit exposure to our hedging counterparties.

In order to
minimize volatility in earnings associated with fluctuations in the value of foreign currency relative to the U.S. Dollar, we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currencies. As a result of entering into these
hedging contracts with major financial institutions, we may be subject to counterparty nonperformance risk. Should there be a counterparty default, we could be exposed to the net losses on the hedged arrangements or be unable to recover anticipated
net gains from the transactions.

Funds associated with certain of our auction rate securities may not be accessible for
more than 12 months and our auction rate securities may experience further other-than-temporary declines in value, which would adversely affect our earnings.

Auction rate securities (ARSs) held by us are securities with long-term nominal maturities, which, in accordance with investment policy guidelines, had credit ratings of AAA and Aaa at time of purchase.
Interest rates for ARS are reset through a “Dutch auction” each month, which prior to February 2008 had provided a liquid market for these securities.

All of our ARSs are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education, and we believe the credit quality of these securities is high, based on this guarantee. However,
liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for certain of our ARS investments, with a par value of $71.3 million. For each failed auction, the interest rate resets to a maximum rate defined for each
security and the ARS continues to pay interest in accordance with its terms, although the principal associated with the ARS will not be accessible until there is a successful auction or such time as other markets for ARS investments develop or the
final maturity of the individual securities.

As of April 29, 2011, we determined there was a total decline in the fair
value of our ARS investments of approximately $6.2 million, of which we have recorded cumulative net temporary impairment charges of $4.1 million, and $2.1 million was recognized as an other-than-temporary impairment charge. In
addition, we have classified all of our auction rate securities as long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets at April 29, 2011 as our ability to liquidate such securities in the next 12 months is uncertain. Although we currently
have the



ability and intent to hold these ARS investments until recovery in market value or until maturity, if current market conditions deteriorate, or the anticipated recovery in market values does not
occur, we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future quarters. We intend, and have the ability, to hold these investments until the market recovers.

We may need to undertake cost-reduction initiatives and restructuring initiatives in the future.

We have previously recognized restructuring charges related to initiatives to realign our business strategies and resize our business in response to economic and market conditions, including those
announced in February 2009 and December 2008. We may undertake future cost-reduction initiatives and restructuring plans that may adversely impact our operations and we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our prior or any future
restructurings.

Our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth and organizational change. If we fail to
effectively manage such growth and change in a manner that preserves our reputation and the key aspects of our corporate culture, our business and operating results could be harmed.

Due to recent organic growth and acquisitions, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, rapid growth and organizational
change, which has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management, operational and financial resources. Our headcount has grown from approximately 8,300 employees on April 30, 2010 to over 11,000 employees following the
ESG acquisition in May 2011. We will incur significant expenditures and the allocation of valuable management resources to assimilate our additional human resources in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture and enables us
to maintain our reputation in the marketplace. If we do not effectively manage our growth and train, retain and manage our employee base, our corporate culture could be undermined, the quality of our products and customer service could suffer, and
our reputation could be harmed, each of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, as our headcount increases, our costs will also increase. Our business will be harmed if our efforts to expand our organization and headcount are not accompanied by a corresponding increase
in revenues.

If we are unable to establish fair value for any undelivered element of a sales arrangement, all or a
portion of the revenues relating to the arrangement could be deferred to future periods.

In the course of our sales
efforts, we often enter into multiple element arrangements that include software related elements consisting of non-essential software and undelivered software entitlements and maintenance. If we are required to change the pricing of our
software-related elements through discounting, or otherwise introduce variability in the pricing of such elements, we may be unable to maintain Vendor Specific Objective Evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements of the arrangement, and
would therefore be required to delay the recognition of all or a portion of the related arrangement. A delay in the recognition of revenues may cause fluctuations in our financial results and may adversely affect our operating margins.

We are continually seeking ways to make our cost structure, business processes and systems more efficient, including moving
activities from higher-cost to lower-cost owned locations, outsourcing certain business process functions and implementing new business information systems. Problems with the execution of these activities could have an adverse effect on our business
or results of operations.

We continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient. We
are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and scalability, and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging our global capabilities, as well as external talent and skills worldwide. For example, certain engineering activities and projects
that were formerly performed in the U.S. have been moved to lower cost international locations and we rely on partners or third-party service providers for the provision of certain business process functions and activities in IT, human
resources and accounting.



The challenges involved with moving or outsourcing activities include executing business
functions in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures. We are also subject to increased business continuity risks as we increase our reliance on outsource providers. For example,
we may no longer be able to exercise control over some aspects of the future development, support or maintenance of outsourced operations and processes, including the management and internal controls associated with those outsourced business
operations and processes, which could adversely affect our business. If we are unable to effectively utilize or integrate and interoperate with external resources or if our partners or third party service providers experience business difficulties
or are unable to provide business services as anticipated, we may need to seek alternative service providers or resume providing these business processes internally, which could be costly and time-consuming and have a material adverse effect on our
operating results. In addition, we may not achieve the expected benefits of our business process improvement initiatives.

We
are currently implementing changes to our business information systems and processes and other IT initiatives. These initiatives involve a large investment of capital and resources and significant changes to our current operating processes. Failure
to properly implement one or more of these initiatives, or an interruption in service or unavailability of our systems, could result in lost business and increased costs which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and cash
flows.

We are subject to risks related to the provision of employee health care benefits and recent health care reform
legislation.

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for workers’ compensation coverage and health
care plans. We record expenses under these plans based on estimates of the number and costs of expected claims, administrative costs and stop-loss premiums. These estimates are then adjusted each year to reflect actual costs incurred. Actual costs
under these plans are subject to variability depending primarily upon participant enrollment and demographics, the actual number and costs of claims made and whether and how much the stop-loss insurance we purchase covers the cost of these claims.
In the event that our cost estimates differ from actual costs, we could incur additional unplanned health care costs which could adversely impact our financial condition.

In March 2010, comprehensive health care reform legislation under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (HR 3590) and the Health Care Education and Affordability Reconciliation Act (HR 4872)
was passed and signed into law. Among other things, the health reform legislation includes guaranteed coverage requirements, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits, restricts the extent to which policies
can be rescinded, and imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits. Provisions of the health reform legislation become effective at various dates over the next several years. The Department of Health and Human
Services, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the Department of Labor and the Treasury Department have yet to issue necessary enabling regulations and guidance with respect to the health care reform legislation.

Due to the breadth and complexity of the health reform legislation, the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, and
the phased-in nature of the implementation, it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the health reform legislation on our business over the coming years. Possible adverse affects of the health reform legislation include reduced revenues,
increased costs, exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or risk of loss of business. In addition, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially
adversely affected.

We depend on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain
such personnel, our operating results could be materially and adversely impacted.

Our continued success depends, in
part, on our ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel. Because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products, we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify,
attract, motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education, background and industry experience. Competition for qualified employees,



particularly in Silicon Valley, can be intense. The loss of the services of a significant number of our employees, particularly our engineers, salespeople and key managers, could be disruptive to
our development efforts or business relationships and could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

A
component of our strategy to hire and retain personnel consists of long-term compensation in the form of equity-based grants. We face increased risk of the inability to continue to offer equity if we are unable to obtain shareholder approval in
light of increased shareholder activism, heightened focus on corporate compensation practices, and increased scrutiny of the dilutive effects of such equity compensation programs. Such inability could adversely impact our ability to continue to
attract and retain employees.

In addition, because of the structure of our incentive compensation plans, we may be at
increased risk of losing employees and other service providers at certain points in time. For example, the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of bonuses or the vesting of stock options, employee stock purchase
rights or other equity compensation. As a result, employees may be more likely to leave us during periods following such payments or the vesting of such rights. The loss of services of a significant number of our key employees during a short period
of time could be disruptive to our product development and sales efforts and adversely impact our business relationships and operating results.

Our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of a natural disaster, terrorist acts or other catastrophic events.

We depend on the ability of our personnel, raw materials, equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world. Any
political, military, terrorism, global trade, world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions. Furthermore, any strike, economic failure or other
material disruption caused by fire, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes, power loss, power shortages, environmental disasters, telecommunications or business information systems failures, break-ins and similar events could also adversely
affect our ability to conduct business. If such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology, or directly impact our marketing,
manufacturing, financial and logistics functions, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, our headquarters are located in Northern California, an area susceptible to earthquakes. If any
significant disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business could be impaired.

Undetected software errors,
hardware errors, or failures found in new products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Product quality problems could lead to reduced revenues, gross margins
and operating results.

Our products may contain undetected software errors, hardware errors or failures when first
introduced or as new versions are released. Despite testing by us and by current and potential customers, errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance,
which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

In addition, if we fail to remedy a product defect, we may
experience a failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs or product reengineering expenses, and these occurrences could have a material impact on our revenues,
gross margins and operating results. We may be subject to losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects in our products, which could subject us to claims for damages, including consequential damages.



We are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection
of intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our operating results.

We may be a party to lawsuits and
other claims in the normal course of our business from time to time, including intellectual property, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory
investigations and proceedings. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could
have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.

If we are unable to protect our
intellectual property, we may be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyright and
trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and patents to protect our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret, copyright and patent
laws, which afford only limited protection. Some of our U.S. trademarks are registered internationally as well. We will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate. We generally enter into confidentiality
agreements with our employees and with our resellers, strategic partners and customers. We currently have multiple U.S. and international patent applications pending and multiple U.S. patents issued. The pending applications may not be
approved, and our existing and future patents may be challenged. If such challenges are brought, the patents may be invalidated. We may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable, and patents issued to us may not
provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties. Further, the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business. In addition, a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations
may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive position.

Litigation may be necessary to protect our
proprietary technology. Any such litigation may be time-consuming and costly. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as
proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may
independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products, or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours.

We are subject to intellectual property infringement claims. We may, from time to time, receive claims that we are infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights. Third parties may in the
future, claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products, patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights. We expect that companies in the network storage and data management market will increasingly be subject to infringement
claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Any such claims could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment
delays, require us to redesign our products or enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms
acceptable to us or at all.

Our business could be materially adversely affected by changes in regulations or standards
regarding energy efficiency of our products and climate change issues.

We continually seek ways to increase the energy
efficiency of our products. Recent analyses have estimated the amount of global carbon emissions that are due to information technology products. As a result, governmental and non-governmental organizations have turned their attention to development
of regulations and standards to drive technological improvements and reduce such amount of carbon emissions. There is a risk that the development of these standards will not fully address the complexity of the technology developed by the IT



industry or will favor certain technological approaches. Depending on the regulations or standards that are ultimately adopted, compliance could adversely affect our business, financial condition
or operating results.

Climate change issues, energy usage and emissions controls may result in new environmental legislation
and regulations, at any or all of the international, federal and state levels, that may unfavorably impact us, our suppliers, and our customers in how we conduct our business including the design, development, and manufacturing of our products. This
could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us.
These costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition.

Our business and results of operations could be
adversely impacted as a consequence of regulations or business trends such as:

•

Decreased demand for storage products that produce significant greenhouse gases;

•

Increased demand for storage products that produce lower emissions and are more energy efficient, and increased competition to develop such
products; and

•

Reputational risk based on negative public perception of publicly reported data on our greenhouse gas emissions.

Our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance, public disclosure, accounting and tax requirements that have
increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.

Because our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to
certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC, and NASDAQ, have implemented requirements and regulations and continue developing additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by Congress, most notably the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue resulting in, increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating
activities to compliance activities.

We have completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting for
the fiscal year ended April 29, 2011 as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Although our assessment, testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that, as of April 29, 2011, our internal controls over
financial reporting were effective, we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods. If our internal controls are ineffective in future periods, our business and reputation could be harmed. We may incur additional expenses and
commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations, both of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results.

On July 21, 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and
will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us. However, as we continue to implement changes in response to this new law and its associated regulations, we expect to incur additional
operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Because new
and modified laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies.
This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices.



If a data center or other third party who relies on our products experiences a
disruption in service or a loss of data, such disruption or loss could be attributed to the quality of our products, thereby causing financial or reputational harm to our business.

Third-party vendors, including data centers, SaaS, cloud computing and Internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers rely on our
products for their data storage needs. We exercise little control over how these third-party vendors use or maintain our products, and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products. A disruption in the
services provided by these third-party vendors, or the loss of data stored by such vendors, could result in financial or reputational harm to our business to the extent that such disruption or loss is caused by, or perceived by our customers to have
been caused by, defects in our products. Moreover, the risk of reputational harm may be magnified and/or distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the Internet, including through news articles, blogs, chat rooms, and social media
sites.

Security and privacy breaches may expose us to liability, and our reputation and business could suffer.

We obtain and store sensitive data related to our employees, customers and partners, including intellectual property,
books of record and personally identifiable information. It is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure remains secure and is perceived by our employees, customers and partners to be secure. If our security measures are breached as
a result of technical problems, third-party actions, employee error, or malfeasance, our reputation could be damaged and our business could suffer.

Changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.

A change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements, such as the changes to
revenue recognition standards that we recently adopted, the increased use of fair value measures, additional proposed changes to revenue recognition, lease accounting, financial instruments and other accounting standards, and the potential
requirement that U.S. registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.

Implementation of accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies, particularly those related to revenue recognition,
could cause us to defer recognition of revenue or recognize lower revenue, which may affect our results of operations.

We own approximately 1.1 million square feet of facilities at our Sunnyvale, California headquarters, of which we occupy
approximately 0.9 million square feet. In addition, we have commitments related to various lease arrangements with BNP Paribas LLC (BNP) for approximately 0.6 million square feet of additional facilities, of which we occupy approximately
0.3 million square feet (as further described below under “Contractual Obligations” in Item 7 and Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements under Item 8). Our headquarters site supports corporate
general administration, sales and marketing, research and development, global services, and operations.

We own approximately
0.6 million square feet of facilities in Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina, of which we occupy approximately 0.5 million square feet. This site supports research and development, global services and sales and marketing.



In connection with the acquisition of ESG, which closed on May 6, 2011, we have
acquired forty acres of land and a 0.3 million square foot facility in Wichita, Kansas. This site supports sales and marketing, research and development, and global services.

We lease and occupy approximately 0.3 million square feet of facilities in Bangalore, India. This site supports sales and marketing,
research and development, and global services. We also own fifteen acres of land in Bangalore, India to be held for future development.

We lease other sales offices and research and development facilities throughout the U.S. and internationally. We expect that our existing facilities and those being developed worldwide are suitable
and adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years and that additional space will be available as needed.

Legal Proceedings

On October 13, 2010, Amalgamated Bank (as trustee of the Longview Largecap 500 Index Fund and the Longview Largecap 500 Index Veba Fund) filed a derivative lawsuit on behalf of NetApp, Inc. and
NetApp U.S. Public Sector, Inc. in the Superior Court of the State of California, Santa Clara County. The lawsuit named 15 of our current and former directors as defendants. On February 3, 2011, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint in
response to motions to dismiss that we and the individual defendants had filed. Like the original complaint, the amended complaint includes claims of breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets and alleges that the defendants failed to
monitor internal controls to ensure that we complied with legal requirements in our General Services Administration (GSA) contracting activities, resulting in us incurring defense and settlement costs. The amended complaint seeks disgorgement of
salaries and other compensation from the defendants and additional unspecified damages. We and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint in early March 2011, and the hearing on these motions is scheduled for
July 15, 2011.

We believe that a number of factors may cause the market price of our common stock to
fluctuate significantly. See “Item 1A. Business — Risk Factors.”

Dividend Policy

We have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently anticipate retaining all available funds, if any, to finance internal
growth and product development as well as other possible management initiatives, including stock repurchases and acquisitions. Payment of dividends in the future will depend upon our earnings and financial condition and such other factors as the
Board of Directors may consider or deem appropriate at the time.

Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans

Information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is incorporated by reference to
our Proxy Statement for the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Unregistered Securities Sold in Fiscal 2011

We did not sell any unregistered securities during fiscal 2011.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

On May 13, 2003, we announced
that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program. As of April 29, 2011, our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $4,023.6 million of common stock under this program. We did not repurchase any
common stock during the fiscal 2011. As of April 29, 2011, we had repurchased 104.3 million shares of our common stock at a weighted-average price of $28.06 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $2,927.4 million since inception
of the stock repurchase program, and the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program was $1,096.3 million with no termination date.



Item 6.

Selected Financial Data

The following selected consolidated financial data set forth below was derived from our historical audited consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and other financial data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results
of operations are not necessarily indicative of results of operations to be expected for any future period.

(1)

In fiscal 2011, we adopted new accounting standards related to revenue recognition. Net revenues and net income were higher by $129.2 million and $53.0 million,
respectively, as a result of adoption of these new standards. Net revenues for fiscal 2009 included a GSA settlement of $128.7 million.

(2)

Based upon the closing price of our common stock for the prescribed measurement period in fiscal 2011, the contingent conversion threshold of the 1.75% Convertible
Senior Notes due 2013 (the Notes) was exceeded as of April 29, 2011. As a result, the Notes are convertible at the option of the holder through June 30, 2011. Accordingly, since the terms of the Notes require the principal to be settled in
cash, we reclassified from stockholders’ equity to temporary equity the portion of the Notes attributable to the conversion feature which had not yet been accreted to its face value and the Notes have been classified as a current liability. For
the holders to be able to continue to convert the Notes, our closing stock price must exceed $41.41 for 20 out of the last 30 trading days of each future calendar quarter. If this threshold is not met, the Notes will be reclassified to long-term
debt and the remaining portion of the Notes attributable to the conversion feature not yet accreted to its face value will be reclassified back to equity.



Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and
the related notes set forth under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”. The following discussion also contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
The Risk Factors set forth in “Item 1. Business” are hereby incorporated into the discussion by reference.

Overview

Revenues for fiscal 2011 were $5.1 billion, up $1.2 billion, or 30%, from fiscal 2010. The improved revenue
performance in fiscal 2011 was predominantly the result of strong demand for our storage efficiency and data management solutions including the new products launched in November 2010. Additionally, net revenues for fiscal 2011 include a favorable
impact of $129.2 million from the adoption of new accounting standards related to revenue recognition. Revenues for fiscal 2010 were $3.9 billion, up $0.5 billion, or 15%, from fiscal 2009. Improved revenue performance in fiscal 2010 was
the result of improvements in product, software entitlements and maintenance (SEM) and service revenues. Revenues in fiscal 2009 were negatively impacted by a $128.7 million settlement with the General Services Administration (GSA). The dispute
related to our discounting practices and compliance with the price reduction provisions of GSA contracts between August 1997 and February 2005.

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased during fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of higher product and service revenues at improved margins. The gross profit margin percentage increased
during fiscal 2010 due largely to reductions in product materials cost, partially offset by a decrease in the overall average selling prices of our products, as well as an increase in our SEM and services revenues mix relative to product revenues.
In addition, our gross profit margin percentage in fiscal 2009 was negatively impacted by the GSA settlement.

Operating
expenses, excluding restructuring and other charges and acquisition related (income) expense, net, for fiscal 2011 totaled $2.5 billion, up 21% from fiscal 2010. The increase is primarily due to a 17% increase in average headcount in fiscal 2011 and
higher levels of incentive compensation and commission expense due to higher revenues and operating profits. Salary and related expenses during fiscal 2011 were favorably impacted by having 52 weeks in fiscal 2011 compared to 53 weeks in fiscal
2010. During fiscal 2010, operating expenses, excluding restructuring and other charges and acquisition related (income) expense, net, totaled $2.1 billion, up 10% from fiscal 2009 and reflected the impact of an increase in incentive
compensation and commissions expense related to our stronger sales and operating profit performance, as well as having 53 weeks in fiscal 2010 compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2009.

During fiscal 2010, we entered into a merger agreement with Data Domain, Inc., which was subsequently terminated on July 8, 2009. In
accordance with the agreement, we received a $57.0 million termination fee, which, when netted against $15.9 million of incremental third-party costs we incurred relating to the terminated merger transaction, resulted in net proceeds of
$41.1 million.

Subsequent Event

On May 6, 2011, we completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities related to the Engenio external storage systems business (ESG) of LSI Corporation (LSI). We paid LSI $480 million in
cash and assumed certain assets and liabilities related to ESG. This acquisition will enable us to further expand our OEM channel, and address emerging and fast-growing segments of the storage market such as video, including full-motion video
capture and digital video surveillance, as well as high-performance computing applications, such as genomics sequencing and scientific research.



The transaction is expected to materially impact our results of operations in fiscal 2012
and beyond. We expect fiscal 2012 ESG product revenues to consist primarily of revenues from sales to their existing OEMs, with new business developing slowly over the course of the year. The fiscal 2012 consolidated product gross margin percentage
is expected to decrease compared to fiscal 2011, reflecting the impact on our existing business of the lower gross margin ESG OEM revenues.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be appropriate in the circumstances. However, actual future results may vary from our
estimates.

We believe that the following accounting policies are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates and
that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require difficult management judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies.

We believe the accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and
therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations.

Revenue Recognition, Reserves and Allowances

Revenue Recognition

— We recognize revenue when:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists:

It is our customary practice to have a purchase order and/or contract prior to
recognizing revenue on an arrangement from our end users, customers, value-added resellers, or distributors.

•

Delivery has occurred:

Our product is physically delivered to our customers, generally with standard transfer terms such as FOB origin. We
typically do not allow for restocking rights with any of our value-added resellers or distributors. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria are achieved. If undelivered products or
services exist that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred.

•

The fee is fixed or determinable:

Arrangements with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms, conditions and practices are not
considered to be fixed or determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized at the earlier of customer payment or when the fees become due and payable. We typically do not allow for price-protection rights with any of our value-added
resellers or distributors.

•

Collection is reasonably assured:

If there is considerable doubt surrounding the credit worthiness of a customer at the outset of an
arrangement, the associated revenue is deferred and recognized upon cash receipt.

Our multiple element
arrangements include our systems and one or more of the following undelivered elements: SEM and premium hardware maintenance. Our SEM entitle our customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis,
bug fixes, and patch releases. Premium hardware maintenance services include contracts for technical support and minimum response times. Revenues



from SEM and premium hardware maintenance services are recognized ratably over the contractual term, generally from one to five years. We also offer extended service contracts (which extend our
standard parts warranty and may include premium hardware maintenance) at the end of the warranty term; revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over the contract term. We also sell professional services either on a time and materials
basis or under fixed price standard projects; we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed. Revenue from hardware installation services is recognized in the period the services are delivered.

In October 2009, the FASB amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to exclude tangible products containing software
components and non-software components that function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality from the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. Concurrently, the FASB also amended the accounting standards
for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to:

•

provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated, and how the arrangement
consideration should be allocated among its elements;

•

require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement that has separate units of accounting using best estimated selling prices (BESP) of
deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value or third-party evidence of selling price (TPE); and

•

eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method to the separate units of
accounting.

We elected to early adopt these standards in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, and the
standards were applied retrospectively from the beginning of fiscal 2011 for new and materially modified revenue arrangements originating after April 30, 2010.

The majority of our products are hardware systems containing software components that function together to provide the essential functionality of the product. Therefore, our hardware systems and software
components essential to the functionality of the hardware systems are considered non-software deliverables and therefore are not subject to industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance.

Our product revenue also includes revenue from the sale of non-essential software products. Non-essential software products may operate
on our hardware systems, but are not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware. Non-essential software sales generally include a perpetual license to our software. Non-essential software sales continue to be subject to the
industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance. For arrangements within the scope of the new guidance, a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value and there are no customer negotiated refunds or
return rights for the delivered elements.

For transactions entered into or materially modified after April 30, 2010, we
recognize revenue in accordance with the new accounting standards when applicable. Certain arrangements with multiple deliverables may continue to have software deliverables that are subject to the existing software revenue recognition guidance
along with non-software deliverables that are subject to the new standards. The revenue for these multiple element arrangements is allocated to the software deliverables and the non-software deliverables as a group based on the relative selling
prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement using the selling price hierarchy set forth in the new standards.

For
our non-software deliverables, we recognize revenue based on the new standards and allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables. For our non-software deliverables, we use BESP as our selling price.
For our software entitlements and support services, we generally use VSOE as our selling price. When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE for our software entitlements and support services, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement
consideration.



VSOE of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and
discounting practices for those services when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for an element fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by a substantial
majority of such historical stand-alone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range. In addition, we consider major service type, customer classifications, and other variables in determining VSOE.

When VSOE cannot be established, the Company attempts to establish selling price of each element based on TPE. TPE is determined based on
competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally, our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with
similar functionality cannot be obtained. Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products’ selling prices are on a stand-alone basis. Therefore, the Company is typically not able to determine TPE for our
products or services.

When we are unable to establish selling price of our non-software deliverables using VSOE or TPE, we
use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. BESP is determined for a product or service by
considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, cost of products, gross margin objectives, historical pricing practices, customer classes and distribution channels. In determining BESP, we require that the majority of the selling prices
fall within a reasonable pricing range, generally evidenced by a majority of such historical transactions falling within a reasonable range.

We regularly review VSOE, TPE, and BESP and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates.

For sales of software deliverables after April 30, 2010 and for all transactions entered into prior to the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we recognize revenue based on software revenue
recognition guidance. Under the software revenue recognition guidance, we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a multiple element arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and VSOE of fair value of all
undelivered elements exists. In the majority of our contracts, the only element that remains undelivered at the time of delivery of the product is SEM and/or service. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred
and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue. If evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist, all revenue is generally deferred until the earlier of when delivery of those elements
occurs or when fair value can be established. In instances where the only undelivered element without fair value is SEM, the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the maintenance period.

Net revenues and net income for the year ended April 29, 2011 were higher by $129.2 million and $53.0 million, respectively, as a
result of adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standards. We are not able to reasonably estimate the effect of adopting these standards on future financial periods as the impact will vary based on the nature and volume of new or
materially modified sales transactions in any given period. In terms of the timing and pattern of revenue recognition, we expect that these new accounting standards will facilitate our efforts to optimize our offerings due to better alignment
between the economics of an arrangement and the related accounting. This may lead us to engage in new go-to-market practices in the future. In particular, we expect that the amended accounting standards will enable us to better integrate products
and services (for which we have not established VSOE) into existing offerings and solutions. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both
VSOE and BESP.

We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment. Sales returns are
estimated based on historical sales returns, current trends, and our expectations regarding future experience. We monitor and analyze the accuracy of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and adjust them for future expectations to
determine the adequacy of our current and future reserve needs. If actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience, additional allowances may be required.



We also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on
our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable. We analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer solvency, current economic and geographic trends,
and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of our current and future allowance. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific
allowance for bad debt is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected. We monitor and analyze the accuracy of our allowance for doubtful accounts estimate by
reviewing past collectability and adjusting it for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future allowance. Our reserve levels have generally been sufficient to cover credit losses. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as of
April 29, 2011 was $0.5 million, compared to $1.6 million as of April 30, 2010. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances
may be required.

Inventory Valuation and Purchase Order Accruals

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis). We perform an
excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. We adjust the inventory value based on estimated excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts.
Although we strive for accuracy in our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory commitments and on our reported
results. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs and other charges against earnings may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may realize higher gross profits in the
period when the written-down inventory is sold. Historically, our inventory valuation adjustments have been sufficient to cover any excess and obsolete exposure and have not required material adjustments in subsequent periods.

In the normal course of business we make commitments to our third party contract manufacturers to manage lead times and meet product
forecasts, and to other parties to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. We establish accruals for estimated losses on purchased commitments when we believe it is probable that the components will not be utilized
in future operations. To the extent that such forecasts are not achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may change.

We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, and
disposal of hazardous chemicals used in the manufacture of our products, which may require design changes or recycling of products we manufacture. We will continue to monitor our compliance with these regulations, which may require us to incur
higher costs, and adversely impact our operating results.

Business Combinations

We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date
fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Significant management judgments and
assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, particularly acquired intangible assets which typically comprise acquired technology, trademarks and tradenames, customer contracts and relationships and
covenants not to compete.

The valuation of purchased intangible assets is principally based upon estimates of the future
performance and cash flows from the acquired business. If different assumptions are used, it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations. Management’s estimates of fair value are
based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent that we identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation.



Valuation of Goodwill and Intangibles

Purchased intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite. In-process research
and development is capitalized at fair value and classified as indefinite-lived assets until completion or abandonment and is subject to periodic review for impairment. Accordingly, the allocation of acquisition cost to identifiable intangible
assets has a significant impact on our future operating results. The allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets. Should conditions
be different than management’s assessment, material write-downs of the fair value of intangible assets may be required. We periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets. A reduction in the estimate of
remaining useful life could result in accelerated amortization expense or a write-down in future periods. As such, any future write-downs of these assets would adversely affect our operating results.

We perform an annual review of the valuation of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators of
impairment exist. Triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions, lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in our market capitalization. Evaluations of
possible impairment and, if applicable, adjustments to carrying values require us to estimate, among other factors, future cash flows, useful lives, and fair market values of our reporting units and assets. When we conduct our evaluation of
goodwill, the fair value of goodwill is assessed using valuation techniques that require significant management judgment. Should conditions be different from management’s last assessment, significant write-downs of goodwill may be required,
which would adversely affect our operating results. In fiscal 2011, we performed such evaluation and determined the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value and therefore, found no impairment of goodwill.

Restructuring Reserves

We recognize a liability for restructuring costs when the liability is incurred. The restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded. These estimates can change
depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was recorded. The main components of our restructuring charges are workforce reduction, intangibles and fixed assets write-offs and non-cancelable lease
costs related to excess facilities. Severance-related charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred, which is generally when individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments. We
record contract cancellation costs when contracts are terminated. The decision to eliminate excess facilities results in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges, net of estimated future sublease income. We
recognize charges for elimination of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises. Intangible asset write-offs consist of impairment of acquired intangible assets related to our decision to cease the development and availability of specific
products. Fixed assets write-offs primarily consist of equipment, software and furniture associated with excess facilities being eliminated, and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future
remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of the equipment and furniture.

Our estimates involve a number of risks and
uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, including future real estate market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into subleases or lease termination agreements with terms as favorable as those assumed when arriving at our
estimates. We regularly evaluate a number of factors to determine the appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring accruals, including the various assumptions noted above. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, we may
be required to adjust our restructuring accruals in the future.

Product Warranties

Estimated future warranty costs are expensed as a cost of product revenues when revenue is recognized, based on estimates of the costs
that may be incurred under our warranty obligations including material, distribution and labor costs. Our accrued liability for estimated future warranty costs is included in other accrued



liabilities and other long-term obligations on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units, estimated material
costs, estimated distribution costs and estimated labor costs. We periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual and adjust the amount as considered necessary.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant. Our option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, expected
term, and forfeiture rate. Any changes in these highly subjective assumptions significantly impact stock-based compensation expense.

Loss Contingencies

We are subject to the possibility of various
loss contingencies arising in the course of business. We consider the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss
contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to
us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.

Fair Value Measurements and Impairments

All of our available-for-sale investments and nonmarketable securities are subject to periodic impairment review. Investments are
considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. This determination requires significant judgment. For publicly traded investments, impairment is determined based upon the specific facts and circumstances
present at the time, including factors such as current economic and market conditions, the credit rating of the security’s issuer, the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below our carrying value, and our ability and intent
to hold investments to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. If an investment’s decline in fair value, caused by factors other than changes in interest rates, is deemed to be
other-than-temporary, we reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value, as determined based on quoted market prices, liquidation values or other metrics. For investments in publicly held companies, we recognize an impairment charge when the
decline in the fair value of our investment is below its cost basis and is judged to be other-than-temporary. The ultimate value realized on these investments is subject to market price volatility until they are sold.

Pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurement and its subsequent updates, fair value is defined as the price that would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the “exit price”) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in
measuring fair value that minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring the use of observable market data when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on active
market data. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.

The fair value hierarchy is broken down into the three input levels summarized below:

•

Level 1 — Valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, and readily accessible by us at
the reporting date. Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs are certain money market funds, U.S. Treasuries and trading securities with quoted prices on active markets.

•

Level 2 — Valuations based on inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in
active markets. Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs are U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and over-the-counter derivatives.



•

Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require us to develop our own
assumptions. Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs are cost method investments, auction rate securities (ARS) and the Primary Fund.

We measure our available-for-sale securities at fair value on a recurring basis. Available-for-sale securities include U.S. Treasury
securities, U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, ARSs, money market funds and certificates of deposit. Where possible, we utilize quoted market prices to measure and such items are classified as Level 1 in the
hierarchy. When quoted market prices for identical assets are unavailable, varying valuation techniques are used. Such assets are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 in the hierarchy. We classify items in Level 2 if investments are
valued using observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. We classify items in Level 3 if investments are valued
using a pricing model, based on unobservable inputs in the market or that require us to develop our own assumptions. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and
considers factors specific to the investment.

We are also exposed to market risk relating to our available-for-sale
investments due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets. The fair value of our investments may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets. These securities/issuers could be subject to review for
possible downgrade. Any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our investments. We monitor and evaluate the accounting for our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for additional
other-than-temporary impairment charges.

We actively review current investment ratings, company specific events, and general
economic conditions in managing our investments and determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other-than-temporary. As of April 29, 2011 and April 30, 2010, our short-term and long-term investments in
marketable securities have been classified as “available-for-sale” and are carried at fair value. Available-for-sale investments with original maturities of greater than three months at the date of purchases are classified as short-term
investments as these investments generally consist of marketable securities that are intended to be available to meet current cash requirements. Currently, all marketable securities held by us are classified as available-for-sale and our entire ARS
portfolio is classified as long-term investments.

Our ARS portfolio consists of securities with long-term nominal maturities
which, in accordance with investment policy guidelines, had credit ratings of AAA and Aaa at the time of purchase. During fiscal 2008, we reclassified all of our investments in ARS from short-term investments to long-term investments as we believed
our ability to liquidate these investments in the next twelve months was uncertain. Based on an analysis of the fair value and marketability of these investments, we recorded cumulative temporary impairment charges of approximately $4.5 million and
$3.3 million during fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively, partially offset by $0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively, in unrealized gains within other comprehensive income (loss). During fiscal 2009, we recorded cumulative temporary
impairment charges of approximately $7.0 million, partially offset by $0.3 million in unrealized gains within other comprehensive income (loss). In addition, during fiscal 2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of
$2.1 million due to a significant decline in the estimated fair values of certain of our ARS related to credit quality risk and rating downgrades.

The valuation models used to estimate the fair value of our ARS include numerous assumptions such as assessments of the underlying structure of each security, expected cash flows, discount rates, credit
ratings, workout periods, and overall capital market liquidity. These assumptions, assessments and the interpretations of relevant market data are subject to uncertainties, are difficult to predict and require significant judgment. The use of
different assumptions, or applying different judgments to inherently subjective matters and changes in future market conditions could result in significantly different estimates of fair value. There is no assurance as to when the market for auction
rate securities will stabilize. The fair value of our ARS could change significantly based on market conditions and continued uncertainties in the credit markets. If these uncertainties continue or if these



securities experience credit rating downgrades, we may incur additional temporary impairment related to our auction rate securities portfolio. We will continue to monitor the fair value of our
ARS and relevant market conditions and will record additional temporary or other-than-temporary impairments if future circumstances warrant such charges.

As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers, which occurred during fiscal 2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $11.8 million on our corporate bonds related to
investments in Lehman Brothers securities and approximately $9.3 million on our investments in the Primary Fund that held Lehman Brothers investments. During fiscal 2010, we sold our remaining holdings of Lehman Brothers bonds and the
Primary Fund made multiple distributions of its assets to its investors, and as of April 30, 2010, we recovered our recorded investment, with the exception of $0.2 million, for which we recognized an additional loss. As of April 30,
2010, we no longer had any direct or indirect investments related to Lehman Brothers and have recognized all related losses in our statements of operations.

During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, recognized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments were not material. Management determines the appropriate classification of investments at the time of
purchase and reevaluates the classification at each reporting date. The fair value of our marketable securities, including those included in cash equivalents and long-term investments, was $4,043.6 million and $3,619.2 million as of
April 29, 2011 and April 30, 2010, respectively.

To determine the fair value of nonmarketable investments, we use
the most recent information available to us, including new financings or estimates of current fair value, as well as traditional valuation techniques. It is our policy to review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to determine
whether the investments in these companies are other-than-temporarily impaired. In the case of privately-held companies, this evaluation is based on information that we request from these companies. If we believe the carrying value of an investment
is in excess of fair value, and this difference is other-than-temporary, it is our policy to write down the investment to fair value. The carrying value of our investments in privately-held companies was $1.3 million and $1.4 million as of
April 29, 2011 and April 30, 2010, respectively. During fiscal 2011 and 2010, we recorded $0.1 million of net impairment charges and $3.4 million of realized gains in our consolidated statements of operations, respectively, for our
investments in privately-held companies, and adjusted the carrying amount of those investments to fair value, as we deemed the decline in the value of these assets to be other-than-temporary.

Income Taxes

The determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to the complexity of the tax law that we are subject to in several tax jurisdictions. Earnings derived from our
international business are generally taxed at rates that are lower than U.S. rates, resulting in a lower effective tax rate than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0%. The ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent on
existing tax laws in both the United States and the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located. Future changes in domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are
currently receiving. In addition, a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from international business or a change in the mix of international business among particular tax jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate.

We account for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the effect of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax attributes related to the exercise of employee stock options are not realized until they result in a reduction of taxes payable. We do not include unrealized stock option attributes as components of our
gross deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance disclosures.



We have provided a valuation allowance of $45.5 million as of April 29, 2011, compared
to $28.3 million as of April 30, 2010 and $28.0 million as of April 24, 2009, on certain of our deferred tax assets. The change in valuation allowance in fiscal 2011 was primarily related to the realizability of state credit
carryforwards as a result of the expected application of the California single sales factor apportionment election. The change in valuation allowance in fiscal 2010 was primarily related to changes in blended state tax rates. The tax effected
amounts of gross unrealized net operating loss and business tax credit carryforwards are $414.2 million as of April 29, 2011.

We recognize tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions by applying a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on income tax returns based on a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax
position would be sustained upon audit. The second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority. Estimating these amounts
requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors, including changes in facts or circumstances,
changes in applicable tax law, settlement of issues under audit and new exposures. If we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations, we adjust the liability and effect a
related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such determination.

Net revenues increased by
$1.2 billion, or 30%, in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 and by $525.0 million, or 15%, in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in our net revenues for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in product revenues, which
comprised 66% of net revenues in fiscal 2011 compared to 61% in fiscal 2010. Additionally, net revenues for fiscal 2011 include a favorable impact of $129.2 million from the adoption of new accounting standards related to revenue recognition. The
increase in net revenues in fiscal 2010 was also primarily related to an increase in product revenues. Net revenues for fiscal 2009 were negatively impacted by the $128.7 million GSA settlement.



Sales through our indirect channels represented 73%, 69% and 69% of net revenues for fiscal
2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The indirect channel mix for 2009 would have been 3% lower if not for the impact of the GSA settlement.

Product revenues increased
by $986.0 million, or 41%, in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, and increased by $228.4 million, or 11%, in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Product revenues for fiscal 2011 include a 4% favorable impact from the adoption of new
accounting standards related to revenue recognition. Product revenues consist of configured systems, which are comprised of bundled hardware and software products, as well as add-on hardware and software and other products. Configured systems unit
volume increased by 46% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, with increases between 40% and 50% in large, medium-sized and smaller systems, and increased 19% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, with the largest increase in smaller systems.
Total configured system revenues increased by $690.3 million in fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010, with the largest increase in medium-sized systems. Total configured system revenues increased by $139.9 million in fiscal 2010, compared to fiscal
2009, with the largest increase in medium-sized systems.

During fiscal 2011, large, medium-sized and smaller systems
generated approximately 22%, 57% and 21% of configured systems revenues, respectively, compared to approximately 23%, 56% and 21%, respectively in fiscal 2010 and approximately 24%, 55% and 21%, respectively in fiscal 2009. Overall average selling
prices (ASPs) decreased in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 due primarily to lower ASPs per unit in large-sized systems as manufacturing cost reductions were passed along to customers as price reductions. ASPs declined in fiscal 2010 compared to
fiscal 2009 due primarily to a shift in mix towards smaller systems, as well as lower ASPs per unit in medium-sized and smaller systems.

In addition, our net add-on hardware, software and other product revenues accounted for a $295.7 million increase in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to customers increasing the capacity
and/or functionality of their storage systems. Our net add-on hardware, software and other product revenues accounted for an $88.5 million increase in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to customers increasing the capacity of their
storage systems.

Our systems are highly configurable to respond to customer requirements in the open systems storage markets
that we serve. This wide variation in customer configurations can significantly impact revenues, cost of revenues, and gross profit performance. Price changes, foreign currency, unit volumes, customer mix and product configuration can also impact
revenues, cost of revenues and gross profit performance. Disks are a significant component of our storage systems. Industry disk pricing continues to fall every year, and we pass along those price decreases to our customers while working to maintain
relatively constant profit margins on our disk drives. As our sales price per terabyte continues to decline, improved system performance, increased capacity and software to manage this increased capacity have an offsetting impact on product
revenues.

Revenues by Geographic Area (in millions, except percentages):

Sales to the United States accounted for 89%, 89% and 90% of Americas’ revenues in fiscal
2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Revenues from the Americas geographic area increased $690.9 million in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. Revenues from the Americas geographic area increased by $402.9 million in fiscal 2010



compared to fiscal 2009, due to an increase in gross revenues of $531.6 million and the negative impact in fiscal 2009 of the $128.7 million GSA settlement. Sales to Germany accounted
for 12%, 11% and 11% of net revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. No other single foreign country accounted for ten percent or more of net revenues in any of the years presented.

Cost of Revenues

Our cost of revenues consists of three elements: (1) cost of product revenues, which includes the costs of manufacturing and shipping of our storage systems, amortization of purchased intangible
assets, inventory write-downs, and warranty costs; (2) cost of SEM, which includes the costs of providing SEM and third party royalty costs, and (3) cost of service revenues, which reflects costs associated with providing support
activities for hardware, global support partnership programs, professional services and educational and training services. Cost of revenues also reflect the adoption of the new accounting standards related to revenue recognition.

Our gross profit is impacted by a variety of factors including pricing and discount practices, product configuration, channel sales mix,
revenue mix and product material costs. Service gross profit is also typically impacted by factors such as changes in the size of our installed base of products, as well as the timing of support service initiations and renewals, and incremental
investments in our customer support infrastructure. If our shipment volumes, product and services mix, average selling prices and pricing actions that impact our gross profit are adversely affected, whether by economic uncertainties or for other
reasons, our gross profit could decline.

Cost of product revenues
increased by $365.6 million, or 37%, in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 and decreased by $31.2 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The changes were comprised of the following elements (in percentage points of the total
change):

In fiscal 2011, the increase in materials cost is primarily due to the 46% increase in configured systems
unit volume, and includes the impact from adoption of the new accounting standards related to revenue recognition. Average materials costs per unit in fiscal 2011 did not significantly change from fiscal 2010. Our fiscal 2011 cost of product
revenues includes:

(i)

an increase of $222.7 million in material costs related to increased volumes in configured systems;

(ii)

an increase of $15.8 million in warranty expenses; and

(iii)

an increase of $127.1 million in costs of hardware add-ons and other product costs.



In fiscal 2010, the decrease in materials cost reflects a decrease in unit costs in our
medium-sized and smaller systems, partially offset by an increase of in high-end systems unit cost. Average materials costs per unit were favorably impacted by lower average per unit materials costs in our medium-sized and smaller systems due to
favorable materials pricing in fiscal 2010, partially offset by an increase in average per unit materials costs in our high-end systems. Our fiscal 2010 cost of product revenues includes:

(i)

a decrease of $9.9 million in material costs, despite an increase in total units shipped;

(ii)

a decrease of $11.3 million in warranty expenses; and

(iii)

a decrease of $8.6 million in inventory valuation charges.

Cost of product revenues represented 40% of product revenue for 2011 compared to 41% for 2010, and 47% for 2009. The overall reduction of costs as a percentage of revenues for both fiscal 2011 and 2010
was the result of reductions in materials cost per unit outpacing sales price reductions.

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 due to increased commissions and incentive compensation plan expenses, as well as an increase in service and support purchased from third parties. Costs represented 42%, 49% and 52%, respectively, of service
revenues for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009. The decrease in service cost of revenues as a percentage of service revenue in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, and fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to improved productivity.

Operating Expenses

Sales and Marketing, Research and Development, and General and Administrative Expenses

Compensation costs comprise the largest component of operating expenses. Included in compensation costs are salaries and related benefits, stock-based compensation costs and employee incentive
compensation plan costs. Compensation costs included in operating expenses increased approximately $202.3 million, or 18%, during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to:

(i) an increase in salaries, benefits and other compensation related costs due to an increase in average headcount, primarily in sales,
marketing and engineering functions, of $169.9 million;



(ii) an increase in incentive compensation expense reflecting stronger operating performance
and increased headcount of $16.7 million; and

(iii) an increase in stock based compensation of $15.7 million.

In addition, sales and marketing expenses reflected an increase in commissions expense of $30.2 million during fiscal 2011,
reflecting stronger sales performance compared to fiscal 2010.

Compensation costs included in operating expenses increased
approximately $108.6 million, or 11%, during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to:

(i) a $75.6 million
increase in employee incentive compensation due to stronger operating profit performance;

(ii) a $16.4 million
increase in stock based compensation; and

(iii) a $16.5 million increase in salaries, benefits and other
compensation related costs.

In addition, sales and marketing expenses reflected an increase in commissions expense of
$60.7 million during fiscal 2010, reflecting stronger sales performance compared to fiscal 2009.

Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plans —

In February 2009, we announced
our decision to execute a worldwide restructuring program, which included a reduction in workforce, the closing or downsizing of certain facilities, and the establishment of a plan to outsource certain internal activities. In December 2008, we
announced our decision to cease the development and availability of our SnapMirror

®

for Open Systems product,
which was originally acquired through our acquisition of Topio in fiscal 2007. As part of this decision, we also announced the closure of our engineering facility in Haifa, Israel. As of April 29, 2011, we had no further facilities-related
lease payment reserves related to these activities.

Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Plan —

As of April 29,
2011, we have no material balances remaining in facility restructuring reserves established as part of a restructuring plan in fiscal 2002 related to future lease commitments on exited facilities, net of expected sublease income.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 15.2%, compared to an effective tax rate of 10.4% for fiscal 2010, and an effective tax
benefit of 681.5% for fiscal 2009. Our effective tax rate reflects our corporate legal entity structure and the global nature of our business with a significant amount of our profits generated and taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates below the
U.S. statutory tax rate. The effective tax rate for both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was favorably impacted by the geographic mix of profits. The tax benefit rate for fiscal 2009 reflected losses generated in the U.S. during that period
that were partially offset by profits generated in foreign tax jurisdictions where the tax rates were below the U.S. statutory rate.

The effective tax rate of 15.2% in fiscal 2011 included a benefit of $146.9 million, or 18.5 percentage points, related to foreign income tax rates that are lower than the U.S. federal
statutory rate of 35%, a benefit of $17.8 million, or 2.2 percentage points, related to research and development tax credits, a benefit of $1.3 million, or 0.2 percentage points, related to stock-based compensation and an IRS audit
settlement of $21.1 million, or 2.7 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of $31.1 million, or 3.9 percentage points, related to state income taxes.



The effective tax rate of 10.4% in fiscal 2010 included a benefit of $105.3 million, or

benefit of $2.6 million, or 0.6 percentages points, related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of $2.6 million, or 0.6 percentage points, related to state income taxes.

The effective tax benefit of 681.5% for fiscal 2009 included the benefit of $51.0 million related to foreign income tax rates that
are lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%, a benefit of $9.2 million related to research and development tax credits, a benefit of $7.9 million related to state income taxes, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of
$10.2 million related to stock-based compensation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements, as well as our sources and uses of cash flows on our liquidity and
capital resources. The principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity. We attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high-quality investment grade securities, limiting the time to
maturity and by monitoring the counter-parties and underlying obligors closely. We believe our cash equivalents and short-term investments are liquid and accessible. We are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash
equivalents or investments from the values reported as of April 29, 2011.

Liquidity Sources, Cash Requirements

Our principal sources of liquidity as of April 29, 2011 consisted of approximately $5.2 billion in cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as cash we expect to generate from operations.

Cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments consist of the following:

As of April 29, 2011, $3.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in
the United States, while $2.2 billion were held in foreign countries. Most of the amounts held outside the United States may be repatriated to the United States but, under current law, would be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. As of
April 29, 2011, we have not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $872.1 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, as such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United
States. If we repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the United States, we would incur U.S. federal and state income tax, reduced by the current amount of our U.S. federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
However, our intent is to keep these funds permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. Our principal liquidity requirements are to fund the $480 million
purchase price of our fiscal 2012 acquisition of certain assets related to ESG, meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, fund research and development, meet capital expenditure needs, invest in critical or complementary
technologies, and to service our debt and synthetic leases. Our contractual obligations as of April 29, 2011 are summarized below in the Contractual Obligations tables.

Key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability, our ability to effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts receivable and
inventories, our ability to effectively integrate acquired products, businesses and technologies, including ESG and conversions of our Notes



by holders. Based on our current business outlook, we believe that our sources of cash will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases,
contractual obligations, commitments, interest payments on our Notes and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, in the event our liquidity is
insufficient, we may be required to further curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions. We cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be
able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on satisfactory terms, if at all.

Our investment portfolio, including
auction rate securities has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets. We continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize our market risk on our investment
portfolio. Based on our ability to access our cash and short-term investments, our expected operating cash flows, and our other potential sources of cash, we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity of these investments will impact our ability
to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other cash requirements. We intend to and believe that we have the ability to hold these investments until the market recovers. If current market conditions deteriorate, we may be
required to record additional charges to earnings in future periods.

Capital Expenditure Requirements

Our capital expenditures were $222.7 million during fiscal 2011. We anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 to
be between $250.0 million and $300.0 million. We expect to fund our capital expenditures, including our commitments related to facilities, equipment, operating leases and internal-use software development projects over the next few years through
existing cash, cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations. The timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors, including future demand for products, changes
in the network storage industry, hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements. We expect that our existing facilities and those being developed in Sunnyvale, California; Research Triangle Park,
North Carolina; and worldwide are adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years and that additional space will be available as needed.

Acquisition Related Requirements

On May 6, 2011, we completed
the acquisition of certain assets related to the ESG business. We paid LSI $480 million in cash and also assumed certain assets and liabilities related to ESG. As of April 29, 2011, we had incurred approximately $4.8 million in acquisition and
one-time integration related expenses for ESG which are included in acquisition related (income) expense, net, in our consolidated statements of operations. As part of our efforts to integrate ESG into our business, we expect to incur additional
one-time integration, restructuring and impairment charges. See Note 20 of the accompanying financial statements for more information.

Cash Flows

As of April 29, 2011, compared to April 30,
2010, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments increased by $1.5 billion to $5.2 billion. The increase was primarily a result of $1.3 billion of cash provided by operating activities and to a lesser extent
from issuances of common stock related to employee stock option exercises and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan of $196.5 million, net of tax benefit, partially offset by $74.9 million and $61.6 million net cash paid in connection
with the acquisitions of Bycast and Akorri, respectively and $222.7 million in capital expenditures. We derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flow from operations and from working capital. Accounts receivable days sales
outstanding as of April 29, 2011 increased to 47 days, compared to 37 days as of April 30, 2010, as material supply constraints through the middle of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 contributed to a back-end loaded shipment
profile, which in turn, drove the increase in days sales outstanding. Working capital increased by $366.3 million to $3.0 billion as of April 29, 2011, compared to $2.6 billion as of April 30, 2010, primarily due



to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.5 billion, partially offset by the reclassification of our $1.2 billion Notes to current liabilities as the
underlying contingent conversion threshold was exceeded at April 29, 2011.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

During fiscal 2011 and 2010, we generated cash from operating activities of $1.3 billion and $975.0 million,
respectively. The primary sources of cash from operating activities in fiscal 2011 consisted of net income of $673.1 million, adjusted by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $175.2 million and depreciation and amortization expense
of $165.6 million. Significant changes in assets and liabilities impacting operating cash flows in fiscal 2011 included an increase in accounts receivable of $262.7 million due to the backend loaded shipment profile during the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2011, an increase in deferred revenue of $382.9 million primarily resulting from overall growth in shipments, and an increase in accrued compensation and other current liabilities of $118.8 million due to our increase in headcount.
The primary sources of cash from operating activities in fiscal 2010 consisted of net income of $400.4 million, adjusted by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $159.8 million and depreciation and amortization expense of
$166.0 million. Significant changes in assets and liabilities impacting operating cash flows in fiscal 2010 included an increase in deferred revenue of $176.7 million and an increase in accrued compensation and other current liabilities of
$53.2 million.

We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a
number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, shipment linearity, accounts receivable collections performance, inventory and supply chain management, tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the timing and amount of
compensation and other payments.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 were $222.7 million. We paid $418.5 million for net purchases and redemptions of our investments in
fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2011, we completed our acquisitions of Bycast and Akorri for total cash payments of $74.9 million and $61.6 million, respectively, net of cash acquired. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 were $135.6 million, which
included the purchase of fifteen acres of land in Bangalore, India for approximately $28.5 million. We paid $860.3 million for net purchases and redemptions of short-term investments in fiscal 2010.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

We received $450.9 million from financing activities in fiscal 2011, which primarily consisted of $324.2 million of proceeds from employee equity award plans, net of shares withheld for taxes, and $127.7
million of excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. We received $219.9 million from financing activities in fiscal 2010, which primarily consisted of $197.1 million of proceeds from employee equity award plans, net of shares withheld
for taxes and $14.2 million from the settlement of a Note hedge with Lehman Brothers.

Net proceeds from the issuance of
common stock related to employee participation in employee equity award programs have historically been a significant component of our liquidity. The extent to which our employees exercise stock options or participate in our ESPP program generally
increases or decreases based upon changes in the market price of our common stock. As a result, our cash flow resulting from the issuance of common stock in connection with these programs and related tax benefits will vary.

Stock Repurchase Program

Since the May 13, 2003 inception of our stock repurchase program through April 29, 2011, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $4.0 billion of common stock under such
stock repurchase program. At April 29, 2011, $1.1 billion remains available under these authorizations. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.



Convertible Notes

As of April 29, 2011, we had $1.265 billion principal amount of 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (See Note 10
of the accompanying consolidated financial statements). The Notes will mature on June 1, 2013, unless earlier repurchased or converted. Based upon the closing price of our common stock for the prescribed measurement period in fiscal 2011, the
contingent conversion threshold of the Notes was exceeded as of April 29, 2011. Accordingly, the carrying value of the Notes was classified as a current liability at April 29, 2011. Since the Notes are convertible at the option of the
holder and the principal amount is required to be paid in cash, the difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of the Notes is reflected as convertible debt in mezzanine on our balance sheet as of April 29, 2011. The
determination of whether or not the Notes are convertible must continue to be performed on an ongoing basis. Consequently, the Notes may not be convertible in future quarters, and therefore may again be classified as long-term debt, if the
contingent conversion threshold is not met in such quarters. As of April 29, 2011, shares issued related to conversion of the Notes were minimal. Receipts of shares related to the Note hedge transactions were minimal and there was no cash
or shares delivered in relation to the warrant transactions as of April 29, 2011.

Contractual Obligations

The following summarizes our contractual obligations at April 29, 2011 and the effect such obligations are
expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions):

Some of the amounts we include in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about
these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal or termination, anticipated actions by management and third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, our actual future
obligations may vary from those reflected in the table. We expect to fund our contractual obligations and other commitments in the table above through existing cash, cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations or obtain
additional financing, if necessary.

(1)

Included in real estate lease payments pursuant to four financing arrangements with BNP Paribas LLC (BNPPLC) are (i) lease commitments of $3.2 million in
fiscal 2012; and $2.1 million in fiscal 2013, which are based on either the LIBOR rate at April 29, 2011 plus a spread or a fixed rate for terms of five years, and (ii) at the expiration or termination of the lease, a supplemental
payment obligation equal to our minimum guarantee of $127.1 million in the event that we elect not to purchase or arrange for sale of the buildings.



(2)

Contract manufacturer commitments consist of obligations for on hand inventories and non-cancelable purchase orders with our contract manufacturer. We record a
liability for firm, noncancelable, and nonreturnable purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts, which is consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of April 29, 2011, the liability
for these purchase commitments in excess of future demand was approximately $4.5 million and is recorded in other current liabilities.

(3)

Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than commitments with
contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase obligations do not include contracts that may be cancelled without penalty. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally
binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.

(4)

Amount includes the $1.265 billion principal amount of 1.75% Notes due 2013 and the estimated fiscal 2012 interest payment for the Notes of $22.1 million.
Based upon the closing price of our common stock for the prescribed measurement period during fiscal 2011, the contingent conversion threshold on the Notes was exceeded. As a result, the Notes are convertible at the option of the holder through
June 30, 2011. Accordingly, since the terms of the Notes require the principal to be settled in cash, we reclassified from equity the portion of the Notes attributable to the conversion feature, which had not yet been accreted to its face
value, and reclassified the Notes to current liabilities. For the holders to be able to continue to convert the Notes, our closing stock price must exceed $41.41 for 20 out of the last 30 trading days of each future calendar quarter. If this
threshold is not met, the Notes will be reclassified to long-term debt.

(5)

As of April 29, 2011, our liability for uncertain tax positions was $104.2 million, which due to the uncertainty of the timing of future payments, are
presented in the total column on a separate line in this table.

As of April 29, 2011, we have four leasing
arrangements (Leasing Arrangements 1, 2, 3 and 4) with BNPPLC which require us to lease certain of our land to BNPPLC for a period of 99 years and to lease approximately 0.6 million square feet of office space for our headquarters in
Sunnyvale, which had an original cost of $149.6 million. Under these leasing arrangements, we pay BNPPLC minimum lease payments, which vary based on LIBOR plus a spread or a fixed rate on the costs of the facilities on the respective lease
commencement dates. We make payments for each of the leases for a term of five years. We have the option to renew each of the leases for two consecutive five-year periods upon approval by BNPPLC. Upon expiration (or upon any earlier termination) of
the lease terms, we must elect one of the following options: (i) purchase the buildings from BNPPLC at cost; (ii) if certain conditions are met, arrange for the sale of the buildings by BNPPLC to a third party for an amount equal to at
least 85% of the costs (residual guarantee), and be liable for any deficiency between the net proceeds received from the third party and such amounts; or (iii) pay BNPPLC supplemental payments for an amount equal to at least 85% of the costs
(residual guarantee), in which event we may recoup some or all of such payments by arranging for a sale of each or all buildings by BNPPLC during the ensuing two-year period. The following table summarizes the costs, the residual guarantee, the
applicable LIBOR plus spread or fixed rate at April 29, 2011 and the date we began to make payments for each of our leasing arrangements (in millions):

All leases require us to
maintain specified financial covenants with which we were in compliance as of April 29, 2011. Such financial covenants include a maximum ratio of Total Debt to Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization of less than three to
one and a minimum amount of Unencumbered Cash



and Short-Term Investments of $300 million. Our failure to comply with these financial covenants could result in a default under the leases which, subject to our right and ability to exercise our
purchase option, would give BNPPLC the right to, among other things, (i) terminate our possession of the leased property and require us to pay lease termination damages and other amounts as set forth in the lease agreements, or
(ii) exercise certain foreclosure remedies. If we were to exercise our purchase option, or be required to pay lease termination damages, these payments would significantly reduce our available liquidity, which could constrain our operating
flexibility.

As of April 29, 2011, we estimated that the fair value of the properties under synthetic lease was
$35.8 million less than their aggregate residual guarantees. We are accruing for this deficiency over the remaining terms of the respective leases. As of April 29, 2011, a deficiency reserve of $16.1 million was included in other long-term
liabilities.

We may from time to time terminate one or more of our leasing arrangements and repay amounts outstanding in
order to meet our operating or other objectives.

Legal Contingencies

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which may arise in the normal course of business. No accrual has been recorded as
of April 29, 2011, as the outcome of these legal matters is currently not determinable.

On October 13, 2010,
Amalgamated Bank (as trustee of the Longview Largecap 500 Index Fund and the Longview Largecap 500 Index Veba Fund) filed a derivative lawsuit on behalf of NetApp, Inc. and NetApp U.S. Public Sector, Inc. in the Superior Court of the State of
California, Santa Clara County. The lawsuit named 15 of our current and former directors as defendants. On February 3, 2011, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint in response to motions to dismiss that we and the individual defendants had
filed. Like the original complaint, the amended complaint includes claims of breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets and alleges that the defendants failed to monitor internal controls to ensure that we complied with legal
requirements in our General Services Administration (GSA) contracting activities, resulting in us incurring defense and settlement costs. The amended complaint seeks disgorgement of salaries and other compensation from the defendants and additional
unspecified damages. We and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint in early March 2011, and the hearing on these motions is scheduled for July 15, 2011.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

During the ordinary course of business, we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by us or our
subsidiaries. As of April 29, 2011, our financial guarantees of $5.3 million that were not recorded on our balance sheet consisted of standby letters of credit related to workers’ compensation, a customs guarantee, a corporate credit
card program, foreign rent guarantees and surety bonds, which were primarily related to self-insurance.

We use derivative
instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency risk. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency. The program is not designated for trading or
speculative purposes. Currently, we do not enter into any foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments or nonmarketable investments. Our major foreign currency exchange exposures and related hedging programs are
described below:

•

We utilize monthly foreign currency forward and options contracts to hedge exchange rate fluctuations related to certain foreign monetary assets and
liabilities.

•

We use currency forward contracts to hedge exposures related to forecasted sales denominated in certain foreign currencies. These contracts are
designated as cash flow hedges and in general closely match the underlying forecasted transactions in duration.



As of April 29, 2011, our notional fair value of foreign exchange forward and foreign
currency option contracts totaled $592.4 million. We do not believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks, because of the short term maturity of the outstanding contracts at any point in time, the counterparties to the
derivatives consist of major financial institutions, and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty. Other than the risk associated with the financial condition of the counterparties, our maximum exposure
related to foreign currency forward and option contracts is limited to the premiums paid. See Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information related to our hedging activities.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into recourse lease financing arrangements with third-party leasing companies and from time
to time provide guarantees for a portion of other financing arrangements under which we could be called upon to make payments to the third-party funding companies in the event of nonpayment by end-user customers. See Note 18 of the accompanying
consolidated financial statements for more information related to these financing arrangements.

We enter into indemnification
agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business. Generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the third party due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright
infringement. These indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements under accounting guidance.

We
have commitments related to four lease arrangements with BNPPLC for approximately 0.6 million square feet of office space for our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California (as further described above under “Contractual Obligations”). Our
future minimum lease payments and residual guarantees under these real estate leases will amount to a total of $132.4 million as discussed above in “Contractual Obligations”.

We have evaluated our accounting for these leases as required by guidance on accounting for variable interest entities and have
determined the following:

•

BNPPLC is a leasing company for BNP Paribas in the United States. BNPPLC is not a “special purpose entity” organized for the sole purpose of
facilitating the leases to us. The obligation to absorb expected losses and receive expected residual returns rests with the parent, BNP Paribas. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary of BNPPLC as we do not absorb the majority of
BNPPLC’s expected losses or expected residual returns; and

•

BNPPLC has represented in the related closing agreements that the fair value of the property leased to us by BNPPLC is less than half of the total of
the fair values of all assets of BNPPLC, excluding any assets of BNPPLC held within a silo. Further, the property leased to NetApp is not held within a silo. The definition of “held within a silo” means that BNPPLC has obtained funds equal
to or in excess of 95% of the fair value of the leased asset to acquire or maintain its investment in such asset through nonrecourse financing or other contractual arrangements, the effect of which is to leave such asset (or proceeds thereof) as the
only significant asset of BNPPLC at risk for the repayment of such funds.

Accordingly, under current
accounting guidance, we are not required to consolidate either the leasing entity or the specific assets that we lease under the BNPPLC lease.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates, market prices, and foreign currency exchange rates. We use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks. We do
not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All financial instruments are used in accordance with management-approved policies.

Market Risk and Market Interest Risk

Investment and Interest
Income

— As of April 29, 2011, we had available-for-sale investments of $2.5 billion. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of greater than three months,
which are classified as available-for-sale. These investments, consisting primarily of corporate bonds, commercial paper, U.S. government agency bonds, U.S. Treasuries, and certificates of deposit, are subject to interest rate and interest
income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates from levels at April 29, 2011 would cause the fair value of these available-for-sale investments to
decline by approximately $3.6 million. Volatility in market interest rates over time will cause variability in our interest income. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.

Our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities. We further mitigate
concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer. We actively review, along with our investment advisors, current
investment ratings, company specific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other-than-temporary. We will monitor and evaluate the accounting
for our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for additional other-than-temporary impairment charges.

We are also exposed
to market risk relating to our auction rate securities due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets. As of April 29, 2011, we recorded cumulative temporary impairment charges of $4.5 million, offset by $0.4 million of
unrealized gains related to these securities. The fair value of our auction rate securities may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets. These securities/issuers could be subject to review for possible
downgrade. Any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our auction rate securities. Changes in the various assumptions used to value these securities and any increase in the markets’
perceived risk associated with such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair value.

If current market
conditions deteriorate, or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur, we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income (loss) or other-than-temporary impairment charges to earnings in future
quarters. We intend, and have the ability, to hold these investments until the market recovers. We do not believe that the lack of liquidity relating to our portfolio investments will impact our ability to fund working capital needs, capital
expenditures or other operating requirements. See Note 9 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
“Liquidity and Capital Resources,” in Part II, Item 7; and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market events that may affect the value and liquidity of the
investments in our portfolio that we held at April 29, 2011.

Lease Commitments

— As of April 29,
2011, one of our four lease arrangements with BNPPLC is based on a floating interest rate. The minimum lease payments will vary based on LIBOR plus a spread. All of our leases have an initial term of five years, and we have the option to renew these
leases for two consecutive five-year periods upon approval by BNPPLC. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rate from the level at April 29, 2011 would increase our lease payments on this one floating lease arrangement
under the initial five-year term by an immaterial amount. We do not currently hedge against market interest rate increases.



Convertible Notes

— In June 2008, we issued $1.265 billion principal
amount of 1.75% Notes due 2013, of which $1.017 billion was allocated to debt and $0.248 billion was allocated to equity. Holders may convert the Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances, including, but not
limited to:

•

during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of the Notes for each day in this five
consecutive trading day period was less than 98% of an amount equal to (i) the last reported sale price of our common stock multiplied by (ii) the conversion rate on such day;

•

during any calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of our common stock for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days
ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price in effect for the Notes on the last trading day of such immediately preceding calendar quarter; or

•

upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions under the indenture for the Notes.

The Notes are convertible into the right to receive cash in an amount up to the principal amount and shares of our common stock for the
conversion value in excess of the principal amount, if any, at an initial conversion rate of 31.4006 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the Notes, which
represents an initial conversion price of $31.85 per share.

Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into
convertible Note hedge transactions and separately, warrant transactions, to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the Notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock. In fiscal
2010, we terminated the hedge transaction with a counterparty to 20% of our Note hedges, and because we have decided not to replace the hedge, we are subject to potential dilution on the 20% unhedged portion of our Notes upon conversion if on the
date of conversion the per-share market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of $31.85.

For at least 20
trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended March 31, 2011, our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price of $41.41 per share set forth for these Notes. Accordingly, the Notes are convertible at the holder’s
option through June 30, 2011, and the carrying value of the Notes was classified as a current liability as of April 29, 2011. Since the Notes are convertible at the option of the holder and the principal amount is required to be paid in
cash, the difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of these Notes is reflected as convertible debt in mezzanine on our consolidated balance sheets as of April 29, 2011. The determination of whether or not the Notes are
convertible must continue to be performed on a quarterly basis. Consequently, the Notes may not be convertible in future quarters, and therefore may again be classified as long-term debt, if the contingent conversion thresholds are not met in
such quarters.

Upon conversion of any Notes, we deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any
excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock. As of April 29, 2011, shares issued related to the Notes were minimal. Based on the closing price of our common stock of $52.11 on
April 29, 2011, the if-converted value of our Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $834.3 million.

The
fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature. Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest rates fall and/or our common stock price increases, and decrease as
interest rates rise and/or our common stock price decreases. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our Notes, but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt
obligations. We do not carry the Notes at fair value, but present the fair value of the principal amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes. As of April 29, 2011, the principal amount of our Notes, which consists of the combined debt and
mezzanine components, was $1.265 billion, and the total estimated fair value of such was $2.1 billion based on the closing trading price of $168 per $100 of our Notes as of that date.



Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts

We hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on
earnings. We utilize forward and option contracts to hedge against the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. All balance sheet hedges are marked to market through
earnings every period. We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to forecasted sales transactions. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under accounting guidance for
derivatives and hedging. For cash flow hedges outstanding at April 29, 2011, the time-value component is recorded in earnings while all other gains or losses were included in other comprehensive income.

We do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes. In entering into forward and option foreign exchange
contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy
multinational commercial banks. All contracts have a maturity of less than one year.

The following table provides information
about our currency forward contracts outstanding on April 29, 2011 and April 30, 2010 (in millions):



Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of

NetApp, Inc.

Sunnyvale, California

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NetApp, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of April 29, 2011 and April 30, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and
stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended April 29, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15. These consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 29, 2011 and April 30, 2010, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 29, 2011, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in the
year ended April 29, 2011, the Company changed its method of recognizing revenue for multiple element arrangements in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-13,

Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements

and ASU 2009-14,

Certain Revenue Arrangements that include Software Elements

.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 29,
2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated June 23, 2011 expressed an unqualified
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

1. The Company

Based in Sunnyvale, California, NetApp, Inc. (“we” or “the Company”) was incorporated in California in April 1992
and reincorporated in Delaware in November 2001; in March 2008, the Company changed its name from Network Appliance, Inc. to NetApp, Inc. The Company is a supplier of enterprise storage and data management software and hardware products and
services. Our solutions help global enterprises meet major information technology challenges such as managing storage growth, assuring secure and timely information access, protecting data and controlling costs by providing innovative solutions that
simplify the complexity associated with managing corporate data.

2. Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal Year

— We operate on a 52-week or 53-week year ending on the last Friday in April. Fiscal 2011 and 2009 were
52-week fiscal years and fiscal 2010 was a 53-week fiscal year.

Principles of Consolidation

— The
consolidated financial statements include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, reserve and allowances; inventory valuation and purchase order accruals; valuation of goodwill and intangibles; restructuring reserves; product
warranties; self-insurance; stock-based compensation; loss contingencies; investment impairments; income taxes, and fair value measurements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Financial Instruments

— For certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate their fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these balances. The following methods were used to estimate the fair value of each class
of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— We
consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities of three months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds, for which the carrying amounts are reasonable
estimates of fair value. Cash equivalents are recognized at fair value.

Short-Term Investments

— Short-term
investments consist of marketable debt or equity securities which are classified as available-for-sale and are recognized at fair value. The determination of fair value is further detailed in Note 9 of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. We regularly review our investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include: the length of time and
extent to which the fair market value has been lower than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, credit quality, likelihood of recovery, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time
sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair market value. We classify our investments as current or noncurrent based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.

Unrealized gains and temporary losses, net of related taxes, are included with accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). Upon
realization, those amounts are reclassified from AOCI to results of operations. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments and realized gains and losses related



NETAPP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

to investments are included in results of operations. Other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale debt securities are determined to be either credit losses or losses due to other
factors. Credit losses are recognized in our results of operations and other losses are included in AOCI.

Fair Value
Measurements and Impairments

— All of our available-for-sale investments and nonmarketable equity securities are subject to a periodic impairment review. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged
to be other-than-temporary. This determination requires significant judgment.

For publicly traded investments, impairment is
determined based upon the specific facts and circumstances present at the time, including factors such as current economic and market conditions, the credit rating of the security’s issuer, the length of time an investment’s fair value has
been below our carrying value, the extent to which fair value was below cost, and our ability and intent to hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in value. If an investment’s decline in fair value,
caused by factors other than changes in interest rates, is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value, as determined based on quoted market prices or liquidation values. Declines in value judged to be
other-than-temporary, if any, are recorded in operations as incurred.

For long-term investments, such as auction rate
securities, impairment is determined based on fair value and marketability of these investments. The valuation models we used to estimate fair value included numerous assumptions such as assessments of the underlying structure of each security,
expected cash flows, discount rates, credit ratings, workout periods, and overall capital market liquidity.

For nonmarketable
investments, impairment is based on the most recent information available to us, including new financings or estimates of current fair value, as well as through traditional valuation techniques. It is our policy to review the fair value of these
investments on a regular basis to determine whether the investments in these companies are other-than-temporarily impaired. In the case of privately-held companies, this evaluation is based on information that we request from these companies. If we
believe the carrying value of an investment is in excess of fair value, and this difference is other-than-temporary, it is our policy to write down the investment to fair value.

Inventories

— Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first
out basis. We write down for excess and obsolete inventory based on the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. In addition, we record a liability for
firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of excess and obsolete inventory.

Property and Equipment

— Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization is computed using
the straight-line method, generally over the following periods:

Construction in progress will be amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets when they are ready for their
intended use.



NETAPP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Software Development Costs

— The costs for the development of new
software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in accordance with the accounting
guidance for software. Because our current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility, which occurs upon the completion of a working model, no costs have been capitalized
for any of the periods presented.

Internal-Use Software Development Costs

— We capitalize qualifying costs, which
are incurred during the application development stage, for computer software developed for or obtained for internal-use and amortize them over the software’s estimated useful life.

Business Combinations

— We recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair
values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions
as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period,
which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent that we identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price
allocation. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets —

Goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for an acquisition
exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Acquisition-related intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic lives of five years for patents, four to six years for existing technology, two
to eight years for customer relationships, one to three years for covenants not to compete and two to seven years for trademarks and tradenames as we believe this method would most closely reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the
assets will be consumed.

Goodwill is measured and tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of our
fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. Triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions, lower projections of profitability, or a
sustained decline in our market capitalization. The performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first step requires comparing the fair value of the each of our reporting units to its net book value, including goodwill. We have three
reporting units, the fair values of which are determined based on an allocation of our entity level market capitalization, as determined through quoted market prices. A potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower
than its net book value. The second step of the process is only performed if a potential impairment exists, and it involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets other than goodwill to the fair
value of the reporting unit and if the difference is less than the net book value of goodwill, an impairment exists and is recorded. We have not been required to perform this second step of the process because the fair value of our reporting units
have exceeded the net book value at every measurement date.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets —

We review the
carrying values of long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances, such as reductions in demand, lower projections of profitability, significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets, or significant negative industry or economic
trends, indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition. If this review indicates that there is an impairment, the impaired asset is written down to its fair
value, which is typically calculated using: (i) quoted market prices and/or (ii) discounted expected future cash



NETAPP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

flows utilizing a discount rate. Our estimates regarding future anticipated net revenue and cash flows, the remaining economic life of the products and technologies, or both, may differ from
those used to assess the recoverability of assets. In that event, impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long-lived assets may be required, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase to net loss in the period when such
determinations are made.

Derivative Instruments

— Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted
to fair value through earnings. If the derivative is designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of the exposure being hedged, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged items through earnings or
recognized in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedge is recognized in earnings immediately.

As a result of our significant international operations, we are subject to risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates. We use derivative financial instruments, principally currency forward contracts
and currency options, to attempt to minimize the impact of exchange rate movements on our balance sheet and operating results. Factors that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of forecasts and the
volatility of foreign currency markets. These programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements. The maturities of these instruments are generally less than one year.

Currently, we do not enter into any foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments or nonmarketable
investments. Cash flows from our derivative programs are included under operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows with the exception of cash flows from the derivatives used to hedge the convertible Notes issued June 10,
2008. The cash flows related to the Note hedges are included under financing activities.

Residual
Guarantees

— We record liabilities in other accrued liabilities for the fair value of residual guarantees relating to certain properties under our synthetic leases. In the event that the fair values of the properties, as
determined by appraisals, are below the residual guarantees, we accrue for the deficiencies over the remaining term of the respective leases.

Revenue Recognition

— We recognize revenue when:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists:

It is our customary practice to have a purchase order and/or contract prior to
recognizing revenue on an arrangement from our end users, customers, value-added resellers, or distributors.

•

Delivery has occurred:

Our product is physically delivered to our customers, generally with standard transfer terms such as FOB origin. We
typically do not allow for restocking rights with any of our value-added resellers or distributors. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria are achieved. If undelivered products or
services exist that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred.

•

The fee is fixed or determinable:

Arrangements with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms, conditions and practices are not
considered to be fixed or determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized at the earlier of customer payment or when the fees become due and payable. We typically do not allow for price-protection rights with any of our value-added
resellers or distributors.

•

Collection is reasonably assured:

If there is considerable doubt surrounding the credit worthiness of a customer at the outset of an
arrangement, the associated revenue is deferred and recognized upon cash receipt.



NETAPP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our multiple element arrangements include our systems and one or more of the following
undelivered elements: software entitlements and maintenance (SEM), premium hardware maintenance, and storage review services. Our SEM entitle our customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis,
bug fixes, and patch releases. Premium hardware maintenance services include contracts for technical support and minimum response times. Revenues from SEM, premium hardware maintenance services and storage review services are recognized ratably over
the contractual term, generally from one to five years. We also offer extended service contracts (which extend our standard parts warranty and may include premium hardware maintenance) at the end of the warranty term; revenues from these contracts
are recognized ratably over the contract term. We also sell professional services either on a time and materials basis or under fixed price standard projects; we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed. Revenue from hardware
installation services is recognized in the period the services are delivered.

In October 2009, the FASB amended the
accounting standards for revenue recognition to exclude tangible products containing software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality from the scope of the software
revenue recognition guidance. Concurrently, the FASB also amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to:

•

provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated, and how the arrangement
consideration should be allocated among its elements;

•

require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement that has separate units of accounting using best estimated selling prices (BESP) of
deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value or third-party evidence of selling price (TPE); and

•

eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method to the separate units of
accounting.

We elected to early adopt these standards in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, and the
standards were applied retrospectively from the beginning of fiscal 2011 for new and materially modified revenue arrangements originating after April 30, 2010.

The majority of our products are hardware systems containing software components that function together to provide the essential functionality of the product. Therefore, our hardware systems and software
components essential to the functionality of the hardware systems are considered non-software deliverables and therefore are not subject to industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance.

Our product revenue also includes revenue from the sale of non-essential software products. Non-essential software products may operate
on our hardware systems, but are not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware. Non-essential software sales generally include a perpetual license to our software. Non-essential software sales continue to be subject to the
industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance. For arrangements within the scope of the new guidance, a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value and there are no customer negotiated refunds or
return rights for the delivered elements.

For transactions entered into or materially modified after April 30, 2010, we
recognize revenue in accordance with the new accounting standards when applicable. Certain arrangements with multiple deliverables may continue to have software deliverables that are subject to the existing software revenue recognition guidance
along with non-software deliverables that are subject to the new standards. The revenue for these multiple element arrangements is allocated to the software deliverables and the non-software deliverables as a group based on the relative selling
prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement using the selling price hierarchy set forth in the standards.



NETAPP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For our non-software deliverables, we recognize revenue based on the new standards and
allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables. For our non-software deliverables, we use BESP as our selling price. For our software entitlements and support services, we generally use VSOE as our
selling price. When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE for our software entitlements and support services, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration.

VSOE of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold
separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for an element fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical stand-alone transactions
falling within a reasonably narrow range. In addition, we consider major service type, customer classifications, and other variables in determining VSOE.

When VSOE cannot be established, the Company attempts to establish selling price of each element based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately.
Generally, our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained. Furthermore, we are
unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products’ selling prices are on a stand-alone basis. Therefore, the Company is typically not able to determine TPE for our products or services.

When we are unable to establish selling price of our non-software deliverables using VSOE or TPE, we use our BESP in our allocation of
arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. BESP is determined for a product or service by considering multiple factors
including, but not limited to, cost of products, gross margin objectives, historical pricing practices, customer classes and distribution channels. In determining BESP, we require that the majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable
pricing range, generally evidenced by a majority of such historical transactions falling within a reasonable range.

We
regularly review VSOE, TPE, and BESP and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates.

For sales of software deliverables after April 30, 2010 and for all transactions entered into prior to the first quarter of fiscal
year 2011, we recognize revenue based on software revenue recognition guidance. Under the software revenue recognition guidance, we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a multiple element arrangement includes one or more elements to be
delivered at a future date and VSOE of fair value of all undelivered elements exists. In the majority of our contracts, the only element that remains undelivered at the time of delivery of the product is SEM and/or service. Under the residual
method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue. If evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist, all revenue is generally
deferred until the earlier of when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established. In instances where the only undelivered element without fair value is SEM, the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the maintenance
period.

Net revenues and net income for the year ended April 29, 2011 were higher by $129.2 million and $53.0 million,
respectively, as a result of adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standards. We are not able to reasonably estimate the effect of adopting these standards on future financial periods as the impact will vary based on the nature and
volume of new or materially modified sales transactions in any given period. In terms of the timing and pattern of revenue recognition, we expect that these new accounting standards will facilitate our efforts to optimize our offerings due to better
alignment between the economics of an arrangement and the related accounting. This may lead us to engage in new go-to-market practices in the future. In particular,



NETAPP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

we expect that the amended accounting standards will enable us to better integrate products and services (for which we have not established VSOE) into existing offerings and solutions. As our
go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP.

We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment. Sales returns are estimated based on historical sales returns, current trends, and our expectations regarding future
experience. We monitor and analyze the accuracy of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future reserve needs. If actual future returns and allowances
differ from past experience, additional allowances may be required.

Sales and Value Added Taxes

— Taxes
collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Product Warranties

— Estimated future warranty costs are expensed as a cost of product revenues when revenue is recognized, based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under our
warranty obligations including material, distribution and labor costs. Our accrued liability for estimated future warranty costs is included in other accrued liabilities and other long-term obligations on the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units, estimated material costs, estimated distribution costs and estimated labor costs. We periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual and adjust the
amount as considered necessary.

Foreign Currency Translation

— For subsidiaries whose functional currency is
the local currency, gains and losses resulting from translation of these foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in AOCI. For subsidiaries where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, gains and losses
resulting from the process of remeasuring foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in other income (expense), net.

Stock-Based Compensation

— We measure and recognize stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based awards, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and rights to
purchase shares under our ESPP, based on their estimated fair value, and recognize the costs in our financial statements over the employees’ requisite service period.

The fair value of employee restricted stock units is equal to the market value of our common stock on the date the award is granted. Calculating the fair value of employee stock options and the rights to
purchase shares under the ESPP requires estimates and significant judgment. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and is not remeasured as a result of subsequent stock
price fluctuations. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of options, and the expected price volatility of the stock underlying such options. Our expected term assumption is based
primarily on historical exercise and post-vesting forfeiture experience. Our stock price volatility assumption is based on an implied volatility of call options and dealer quotes on call options, generally having a term of greater than twelve
months. The risk-free interest rate is based upon United States Treasury bills with equivalent expected terms, and the expected dividend is based on our history and expected dividend payouts. Changes in the subjective assumptions required in the
valuation models may significantly affect the estimated value of our stock-based awards and the related stock-based compensation expense. Likewise, the shortening of the contractual life of our options could change the estimated exercise behavior in
a manner other than currently expected.



NETAPP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In addition, we estimate the number of stock-based awards that will be forfeited due to
employee turnover. Our forfeiture assumption is based primarily on historical experience. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock-based compensation expense, as the effect of adjusting the rate is
recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed.

Income Taxes

— Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are provided for temporary differences that will result in tax deductions or income in future periods, as well as the future benefit of tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance reduces tax assets to their estimated realizable
value.

Determining the liability for uncertain tax positions requires us to make significant estimates and judgments as to
whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due based on potential tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions throughout the world. Our estimates are based on the outcomes of previous audits, as well as the
precedents set in cases in which others have taken similar tax positions to those taken by us. If we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations, we adjust the liability and
effect a related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such a determination.

The accounting guidance
for income taxes prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return (including a decision
whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction). We recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on the two-step process prescribed in the interpretation. The first step is to
determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit. The second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement with the tax authority. Estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. See note 14 for further discussion.

Net Income per Share

— Basic net income per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding, excluding common shares subject to repurchase for that period. Diluted net income per share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential shares that were outstanding during the period.
Dilutive potential common shares consist of incremental common shares subject to repurchase, common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options, restricted stock awards, ESPP shares, warrants, and assumed conversion of our Notes. Repurchased
shares are held as treasury stock and our outstanding shares used to calculate earnings per share have been reduced by the weighted number of repurchased shares.

3. Concentration of Risk

Financial instruments that potentially
subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments, foreign exchange contracts and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of corporate bonds,
U.S. government agency securities, and money market funds, all of which are considered high investment grade. Our policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities. We further
mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer.

Our long term investments, consisting primarily of auction rate securities, have been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due
to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets.



NETAPP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In entering into forward foreign exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might
arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The counterparties to these contracts are major multinational commercial banks, and we do not expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults.

We sell our products primarily to large organizations in different industries and geographies. We do not require collateral
or other security to support accounts receivable. In addition, we maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. To reduce credit risk, we perform ongoing credit evaluations on our customers’ financial condition. We establish an allowance
for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends and other information and, to date, such losses have been within management’s expectations. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade
accounts receivable are limited due to the wide variety of customers who are dispersed across many geographic regions.

There
are no concentrations of business transacted with a particular market that would severely impact our business in the near term. However, we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain key components and a few key contract
manufacturers to manufacture most of our products; any disruption or termination of these arrangements could materially adversely affect our operating results.

4. Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective

In December 2010,
the FASB issued authoritative guidance on business combinations. This authoritative guidance requires a public entity that presents comparative financial statements to disclose the revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business
combinations that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the prior annual reporting period. In addition, this authoritative guidance expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature
and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. This authoritative guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations
for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. This guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. There will be no impact
on the Company’s results as the amendments relate only to additional disclosures.

In December 2010, the FASB issued
amendments to the guidance on goodwill impairment testing. The amendments modify Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of
the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In making that determination, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. The
amendments are effective for us at the beginning of fiscal year 2012 and are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.

In May 2011, the FASB issued new guidance for fair value measurements to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar
between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements. The guidance
is effective for us prospectively beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, and we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our financial statements.

9. Financial Instruments and Fair Value

We measure assets and liabilities at fair value based upon expected exit price, representing the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability, as the case may be,
in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The accounting guidance provides a framework for measuring fair value on either a
recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:

Level 1:

Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in
active markets.



NETAPP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Level 2:

Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical
assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from
or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to
determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.

We consider an active market to be one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, and view an inactive
market as one in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers. Where appropriate, our own or the counterparty’s
non-performance risk is considered in determining the fair values of liabilities and assets, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Reported as (in millions):

We classify investments within Level 1 if quoted prices are available in active markets. Level 1
investments generally include trading securities with quoted prices on active markets, and money market funds.

We classify
items in Level 2 if the investments are valued using observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. These
investments include: corporate bonds, commercial paper, U.S. Treasuries, U.S. government agency bonds, municipal bonds, certificates of deposit, and foreign currency contracts. Investments are held by a custodian who obtains investment
prices from a third party pricing provider that incorporates standard inputs in various asset price models. We corroborate the prices obtained from the pricing service against other independent sources and, as of April 29, 2011, have not found
it necessary to make any adjustments to the prices obtained.

The unrealized losses on our available-for-sale investments in
corporate bonds and U.S. treasury and government debt securities were caused by market value declines as a result of the recent economic environment, as well as fluctuations in market interest rates. Because the decline in market value is
attributable to changes in market conditions and not credit quality, and because we neither intend to sell nor are likely to be required to sell these investments prior to a recovery of par value, we do not consider these investments to be
other-than temporarily impaired at April 29, 2011.

Our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are also classified
within Level 2. We determine the fair value of these instruments by considering the estimated amount we would pay or receive to terminate these agreements at the reporting date. We use observable inputs, including quoted prices in active
markets for similar assets or liabilities. Our foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets.

We classify items in Level 3 if the investments are valued using a pricing model or
based on unobservable inputs in the market. These investments include auction rate securities and cost method investments. The table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of our Level 3 financial assets measured at
fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs as of April 29, 2011 (in millions).

As of April 24, 2009, we held an investment in the Reserve Primary Fund (the Primary Fund), a money
market fund which had suspended redemptions in September 2008 and was in the process of liquidating its portfolio of investments, with a recorded value of $51.6 million that had been previously written down from its par value of
$60.9 million. During fiscal 2010, the Primary Fund made multiple distributions of its assets to its investors and we recognized an additional loss of $0.2 million in our income statement, and as of April 30, 2010, we had recovered
$51.4 million of our recorded investment. Future distributions, if any, will be recognized as income upon receipt. During fiscal 2011 and 2010, we received $2.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in distributions from our investment in the
Primary Fund.

As of April 29, 2011 and April 30, 2010, we had auction rate securities (ARSs) with a par value of
$71.3 million and $73.8 million, respectively, and an estimated fair value of $65.1 million and $69.0 million, respectively, which are classified as long-term investments. All of our ARSs are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the U.S.
Department of Education. As of April 29, 2011, we recorded cumulative net temporary impairment charges of $4.1 million within AOCI. In addition, we recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges of $2.1 million in other income (expense),
net, during fiscal 2009 based on an analysis of the fair value and marketability of these investments. We estimated the fair value for each individual ARS using an income (discounted cash flow) approach that incorporates both observable and
unobservable inputs to discount the expected future cash flows. Key inputs into the discounted cash flow analysis include managements’ expectation of when the principal amount will be recovered either through redemption at par, or some other
refinancing event by the issuer; and marketability adjustments. Based on our ability to access our cash and other short-term investments, our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not intend to sell these investments
prior to recovery of value. We will continue to monitor our ARS investments in light of the current debt market environment and evaluate our accounting for these investments.

As of April 29, 2011 and April 30, 2010, we held investments in a private equity fund of $1.3 million and $1.4 million, respectively. During fiscal 2011, we recorded a net
other-than-temporary impairment charge of $0.1 million on the private equity fund. During fiscal 2010, we recorded realized gains of $0.8 million on this investment and $2.6 million on equity investments in privately held companies. During
fiscal 2009, we recorded



NETAPP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

$6.3 million of other-than-temporary impairment charges on certain of the equity investments in privately held companies and adjusted their carrying amount to fair value, as we deemed the
decline in the value of those assets to be other-than-temporary.

Other Fair Value Disclosures

The fair value of certain of our financial instruments that are not measured at fair value, including accounts receivable, accounts
payable, accrued compensation, and other current liabilities, approximates the carrying amount because of their short maturities. The fair value of our Notes is disclosed in Note 10 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and was
determined using quoted market prices for those securities.

Financing Arrangements

1.75% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013

On June 10, 2008, we issued $1,265.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the Notes). The Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of the
Company. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually at a rate of 1.75% per annum. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2013 unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The Notes may be converted, under the
conditions specified below, based on an initial conversion rate of 31.40 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of Notes (which represents an initial effective conversion price of the Notes of approximately $31.85 per share), subject
to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the Notes. We received net proceeds of $1,238.4 million, after deducting issuance costs of $26.6 million.

The Notes are not redeemable by us prior to the maturity date. In the event of a fundamental change, holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes at a repurchase price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.

The holders of the Notes may convert their Notes until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date if any of the following conditions are met:
(1) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price of the Notes for each day in the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported
sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the Notes on each such day; (2) during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) if the last reported sale price of our common stock for 20 or more trading days in a
period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price in effect for the Notes on the last trading day of such immediately preceding calendar
quarter; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions set forth in the indenture for the Notes. On or after March 1, 2013 until the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders of the Notes may
convert their Notes regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion, a holder will receive cash in an amount equal to the lesser of the conversion value and the principal amount of the Notes, and any shares of our common stock for any
conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the Notes, if any. Holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture for the Notes) will, under certain circumstances, be entitled
to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate.

For at least 20 trading days during the 30
consecutive trading days ended March 31, 2011, our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price of $41.41 per share set forth for these Notes. Accordingly, the Notes are convertible at the holder’s option through
June 30, 2011, and the carrying value of the Notes was



NETAPP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

classified as a current liability as of April 29, 2011. Since the Notes are convertible at the option of the holder and the principal amount is required to be paid in cash, the difference
between the principal amount and the carrying value of the Notes is reflected as convertible debt in mezzanine on our Balance Sheet as of April 29, 2011. The determination of whether or not the Notes are convertible must continue to be
performed on a quarterly basis. Consequently, the Notes may not be convertible in future quarters, and therefore may again be classified as long-term debt, if the contingent conversion thresholds are not met in such quarters.

Upon conversion of any Notes, we deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value
greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock. As of April 29, 2011, shares issued related to the Notes were minimal. Based on the closing price of our common stock of $52.11 on April 29, 2011, the if-converted
value of our Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $834.3 million.

We separately account for the liability
and equity components of the Notes. The initial debt component of the Notes was valued at $1,017.0 million based on the contractual cash flows discounted at an appropriate comparable market non-convertible debt borrowing rate at the date of
issuance of 6.31%, with the equity component representing the residual amount of the proceeds of $248.0 million which was recorded as a debt discount. Issuance costs were allocated pro rata based on the relative initial carrying amounts of the
debt and equity components. As a result, $5.2 million of the issuance costs were allocated to the equity component of the Notes, and $21.4 million of the issuance costs remained classified as long-term other assets. The debt discount and
the issuance costs allocated to the debt component are amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the Notes using the effective interest method and an effective interest rate of 6.31% for all periods presented.

Note Hedges and Warrants

Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we purchased Note hedges and sold warrants. The separate Note hedge and warrants transactions
are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the Notes.

•

Note Hedges. As of April 29, 2011 and April 30, 2010, we have transactions with counterparties to buy up to approximately 31.8 million
shares, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of our common stock at a price of $31.85 per share, subject to adjustment. The Note hedge transactions will expire at the earlier of (1) the last day on which any Notes remain outstanding and
(2) the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Notes. Upon exercise of the Note hedges, we have the option to receive cash or shares of our common stock equal to the difference between the then market price and the
strike price of the hedges.

•

Warrants. As of April 29, 2011 and April 30, 2010, we have outstanding warrants for others to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments,
39.7 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $41.28 per share, subject to adjustment, on a series of days commencing on September 3, 2013. Upon exercise of the warrants, we have the option to deliver cash or shares of
our common stock equal to the difference between the then market price and the strike price of the warrants.

As of April 29, 2011, we are subject to potential dilution on the approximately 20% unhedged portion of our Notes upon conversion,
if on the date of conversion, the per-share market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of approximately $31.85.

As of April 29, 2011, receipts of shares related to the Note hedge transactions were minimal. Additionally, there was no cash or shares delivered in relation to the warrant transactions. We received
proceeds of $163.1 million related to the sale of the warrants in fiscal year 2009, which has been classified as equity. In fiscal years 2009 and 2010 we did not receive any shares related to the Note hedge transactions or deliver cash or
shares related to the warrant transactions.

Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives, Inc. (Lehman OTC) was the counterparty to 20% of
our Note hedges. The bankruptcy filing by Lehman OTC on October 3, 2008 constituted an “event of default” under the hedge transaction. In April 2010, we terminated the hedge transaction with Lehman OTC in exchange for an unsecured
bankruptcy claim, which we subsequently sold to a third party for $14.2 million. Because we have decided not to replace the hedge, we are subject to potential dilution on the 20% unhedged portion of our Notes upon conversion, if on the date of
conversion, the per-share market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of $31.85. The terms of the Notes, the rights of the holders of the Notes and other counterparties to Note hedges and warrants were not affected by the
termination of this hedge.

Fair Value of Notes

As of April 29, 2011, the approximate fair value of the principal amount of our Notes, which includes the debt and equity components,
was approximately $2,127.5 million, or 168% of the face value of the Notes, based upon quoted market information.

Equity Incentive Programs

Acquisition Plans

— We
have assumed stock incentive plans in connection with our acquisitions. The options granted under these plans generally vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and then ratably over the following
36 months. The restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 50% on the first and second annual anniversaries of the vesting commencement date.

The 1999 Plan

— As amended through July 13, 2010, the 1999 Stock Option Plan (“the 1999 Plan”) comprises five separate equity incentive programs: (i) the Discretionary
Option Grant Program under which options may be granted to eligible individuals at a fixed price per share; (ii) the Stock Appreciation Rights Program under which eligible persons may be granted stock appreciation rights that allow individuals
to receive the appreciation in Fair Market Value of the shares; (iii) the Stock Issuance Program under which eligible individuals may be issued shares of Common Stock directly; (iv) the Performance Share and Performance Unit Program (also
known as restricted stock units or RSUs) under which eligible persons may be granted performance shares and performance units which result in payment to the participant only if performance goals or other vesting criteria are achieved; and
(v) the Automatic Award Program under which nonemployee board members automatically receive equity grants at designated intervals over their period of board service.

Under the 1999 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant to employees, nonemployee directors, and consultants and other independent advisors options to purchase shares of our common stock during their period
of service with us. The exercise price for an incentive stock option and a nonstatutory option cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. Options granted under the 1999 Plan generally vest over a
four-year period. Options granted prior to April 29, 2006, have a term of no more than 10 years after the date of grant and those granted after April 29, 2006 have a term of no more than seven years, subject to earlier termination
upon the occurrence of certain events. The 1999 Plan prohibits the repricing of any outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right after it has been granted or to cancel any outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right and immediately
replace it with a new stock option or stock appreciation right with a lower exercise price unless approved by stockholders. RSUs granted under the 1999 Plan generally vest over a four-year period with 25% of the units vesting on each annual
anniversary of the grant date. The 1999 Plan limits the number of shares issued under the Stock Issuance Program and the Performance Share and Performance Unit Program to 8.9 million shares plus 50% of the awards cancelled and returned to the
1999 Plan and 50% of the number of shares added to the 1999 Plan after the 2009 Annual Meeting. The 1999 Plan limits the value of performance units a participant may receive during any calendar year to $2.0 million. The 1999 Plan expires in
August 2019.

In fiscal 2011, the 1999 Plan was amended to increase the shares reserved for issuance under the plan by an
additional 7.0 million. As of April 29, 2011, 14.1 million shares were available for grant under our equity incentive plans.

NETAPP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

RSUs are converted into common stock upon vesting. Upon the vesting of restricted stock,
we primarily use the net share settlement approach, which withholds a portion of the shares to cover the applicable taxes and decreases the shares issued to the employee by a corresponding value. The number and the value of the shares netted for
employee taxes are summarized in the table below (in millions):

As of April 29,
2011, there was $240.5 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to RSUs. The unrecognized compensation expense will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of 2.6 years.

Stock Option Exchange

In April 2009, our stockholders approved a stock option exchange program (the Exchange) pursuant to which eligible employees were able to exchange some or all of their outstanding options with an exercise
price greater than or equal to $22.00 per share that were granted before June 20, 2008, whether vested or unvested, for new RSUs. In connection with the Exchange, we exchanged options to purchase 24.5 million shares of our common stock for
total of 3.2 million RSUs. The fair value of the RSUs issued was measured as the total of the unrecognized compensation cost of the options surrendered and the incremental value of the RSUs issued, measured as the excess of the fair value of
the RSUs over the fair value of the options tendered immediately before the exchange. The incremental cost of the RSUs was $5.8 million. The value of the RSUs, totaling $70.1 million, is being amortized over the weighted average vesting
period of the RSUs of 3.5 years.

Stock Issuance Program

— Under the 1999 Stock Issuance Program,
certain eligible persons may be issued shares of common stock directly. No restricted stock awards (RSAs) were issued to employees during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009. At April 29, 2011, 7.7 million shares were available for future issuances
under this program.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

— Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), employees
are entitled to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the fair market value at certain specified dates over a two-year period. In fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the plan was amended to increase the share reserved by an additional
5.0 million, 6.7 million and 2.9 million shares of common stock, respectively. Of the 35.2 million shares authorized to be issued under this plan, 4.0 million shares were available for issuance at April 29, 2011.

Stock Repurchase Program

Since the May 13, 2003 inception of our stock repurchase program through April 29, 2011, we have repurchased a total of
104.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $28.06 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $2.9 billion. As of April 29, 2011, our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $4.0 billion of common
stock under this stock repurchase program, and $1.1 billion remains available under these authorizations. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

During fiscal years 2011 and 2010, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program. During fiscal
2009, we repurchased 17.0 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $400.0 million, or a weighted average price of $23.58 per share. The repurchases were recorded as treasury stock and resulted in a reduction of
stockholders’ equity.

Preferred Stock

Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 5.0 million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights,
preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders.

12. Derivatives and Hedging Activities

We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency risk. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in
foreign currency. The program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We seek to mitigate such risk by
limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with



NETAPP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. We also have in place a master netting arrangement to mitigate the credit risk of our counterparty
and potentially to reduce our losses due to counterparty nonperformance. All contracts have a maturity of less than six months.

Our major foreign currency exchange exposures and related hedging programs are described below:

Balance Sheet.

We utilize monthly foreign currency forward and options contracts to hedge exchange rate fluctuations related
to certain foreign monetary assets and liabilities. These derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on
the assets and liabilities being hedged and the net amount is included in earnings.

Forecasted Transactions.

We
use currency forward contracts to hedge exposures related to forecasted sales denominated in certain foreign currencies. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and in general closely match the underlying forecasted transactions in
duration. The contracts are carried on the balance sheet at fair value, and the effective portion of the contracts’ gains and losses is recorded as AOCI until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we
reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenues. If the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur, or it becomes probable that they will not occur, the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge is recognized
immediately in earnings. We measure the effectiveness of hedges of forecasted transactions on a monthly basis by comparing the fair values of the designated currency forward contracts with the fair values of the forecasted transactions. Any
ineffective portion of the derivative hedging gain or loss as well as changes in the fair value of the derivative’s time value (which are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness) is recognized in current period earnings.

Over the next twelve months, it is expected that $2.3 million of derivative net losses recorded in AOCI as of April 29, 2011
will be reclassified into earnings as an adjustment to revenues. The maximum length of time over which forecasted foreign denominated revenues are hedged is six months.

The notional value of our outstanding currency forward contracts that were entered into to hedge forecasted foreign denominated sales and our balance sheet monetary asset and liability exposures consisted
of the following (in millions):

As of April 29,
2011 and April 30, 2010, the fair value of our short-term foreign currency contracts was not material. Certain of these contracts are designed to hedge our exposure to foreign monetary assets and liabilities and are not accounted for as a
hedging activity. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change. Net deferred gains and losses relating to changes in fair value of our foreign currency contracts that are accounted
for as cash flow hedges were not material for any period



NETAPP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

presented. We did not recognize any gains and losses in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness for any period presented. The amount of net losses recorded in AOCI as of April 29, 2011 was not
material. Gain (loss) on derivative instruments was a loss of $20.6 million in fiscal 2011 and gains of $8.2 million and $20.9 million in fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively.

million were accrued for and paid out for severance-related charges during this period. As of April 29, 2011 we had approximately $0.1 million relating to abandoned lease-related restructuring reserves resulting from this acquisition.

Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plans

In February 2009, we announced our decision to execute a worldwide restructuring program, which included a reduction
in workforce, the closing or downsizing of certain facilities, and the establishment of a plan to outsource certain internal activities. In December 2008, we announced our decision to cease the development and availability of our SnapMirror

Current and noncurrent net deferred tax assets for fiscal 2011 and 2010 are as follows
(in millions):

The valuation
allowance increased by $17.2 million and $0.3 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The change in valuation allowance in fiscal 2011 was primarily related to the realizability of state credit carryforwards as a result of the
expected application of the California single sales factor apportionment election. The change in valuation allowance in fiscal 2010 was primarily related to changes of blended state tax rates.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):

Of the $133.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits at April 29, 2011, $104.2 million has been
recorded and included in other long-term liabilities, of which $92.7 million, if recognized, would affect our provision for income taxes.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized foreign tax benefits in the income tax provision. During the fiscal years ended 2005 through 2011, we recognized total accrued interest
and penalties of approximately $1.0 million and have included this accrual in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits.

During fiscal 2010, we recorded a $32.1 million charge to additional paid in capital related to the establishment of a
$26.1 million tax liability to provide for the uncertainty relating to the tax treatment of the termination of the Lehman Brothers bond hedge, as well a $6.0 million deferred tax liability for related temporary tax return differences in
the valuation of the convertible debt as a result of the transaction.

We are subject to taxation in the United States,
various states, and several foreign jurisdictions.



NETAPP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The tax years that remain subject to examination for our major tax jurisdictions are
shown below:

Tax Years Subject to Examination for Major Tax Jurisdictions at April 29, 2011

In addition, we are effectively
subject to federal tax examination adjustments for tax years ended on or after fiscal year 2000, in that we have net operating loss carryforwards from these years that could be subject to adjustment, if and when utilized.

We are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the United States and several foreign tax jurisdictions. The rights to some of
our intellectual property (IP) are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made between U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this IP in a qualified cost sharing arrangement. In recent years, several other
U.S. companies have had their foreign IP arrangements challenged as part of IRS examinations, which has resulted in material proposed assessments and/or litigation with respect to those companies.

During fiscal year 2009, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustments from the IRS in connection with a federal income tax audit of our
fiscal 2003 and 2004 tax returns. We filed a protest with the IRS in response to the Notices of Proposed Adjustments and subsequently received a rebuttal from the IRS examination team in response to our protest. In April 2011, we executed a closing
agreement with the IRS Appeals Office to close this examination. The Notices of Proposed Adjustments in this audit focused primarily on issues relating to the timing and the amount of income recognized, deductions taken and on the level of cost
allocations made to foreign operations during the audit years. The settlement of our 2003-2004 IRS examination resulted in additional liability of $10.8 million, which is almost entirely offset by net operating loss carryforwards. As a result of the
examination settlement, we have reduced our reserve for uncertain tax positions and recognized a net benefit of $21.1 million.

We do not include unrealized stock option attributes as components of our gross deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance
disclosures. The tax effected amounts of gross unrealized net operating loss and business tax credit carryforwards are $414.2 million as of April 29, 2011, which will result in additional paid in capital if and when realized as a reduction
in taxes otherwise paid.

As of April 29, 2011, the amount of accumulated unremitted earnings from our foreign
subsidiaries is approximately $872.1 million.

Network Appliance Systems India Pvt. Ltd., our Indian subsidiary, received
a tax holiday from the Indian tax authorities attributed to its call center and research and development activities effective June 6, 2003. These activities qualify under the Software Technology Park of India (STPI) incentive for the
development and manufacture of computer software and information technology enabled services. Under this tax holiday, net taxable income derived from call center and research and development activities is exempt from Indian taxation.



NETAPP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The income tax holiday expired on March 31, 2011. Other tax and customs benefits remain available. Notwithstanding qualification for the income tax holiday, minimum alternate tax rules in
India effective for us as of fiscal 2009 overrode the full tax exemption. For fiscal 2010, we were subject to a minimum alternate tax on this income in India at a rate of 16.99%. The minimum alternate tax paid is eligible for credit against regular
tax paid in future years. The credits may be carried forward for ten years.

In April 2010 our Dutch subsidiary received a
favorable tax ruling from the Dutch tax authorities effective May 1, 2010 that replaces the previous Dutch tax ruling that expired on April 30, 2010. This ruling results in both a lower level of earnings subject to tax in the Netherlands
and an extension of the expiration date to April 30, 2015.

As of April 29, 2011, the federal, and state net
operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $781.2 million and $352.9 million, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2022. State net operating losses of
$26.4 million will expire in fiscal years 2012 through 2014; $11.3 million will expire in fiscal year 2015 while the remaining $315.2 million will expire in fiscal years 2016 through 2031.

As of April 29, 2011, we had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $108.9 million and $93.3 million,
respectively, available to offset future income tax liabilities. Federal tax credit carryforwards of $55.7 million will begin to expire in fiscal years 2016 through 2023, while the remaining $53.2 million will expire in fiscal years
beginning 2024. State tax credits of $0.04 million will expire in fiscal years 2012 through 2014, while the remaining $93.3 million is available indefinitely to reduce cash taxes otherwise payable. As discussed above, most of the net
operating loss and tax credit carryovers, if realized, will be recognized as additional paid in capital in that they are employee stock option tax attributes.

On December 17, 2010, the Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the Act) was signed into law. Under the Act, the federal research credit was retroactively
extended for amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2009, and before January 1, 2012.

During fiscal year 2010,
the IRS commenced the examination of our fiscal 2005 through 2007 federal income tax returns, and, in addition, the California Franchise Tax Board began the examination of our fiscal 2007 and 2008 California income tax returns. These audits are
currently in progress.

If, upon the conclusion of these audits, the ultimate determination of taxes owed in the U.S. is for
an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded in the applicable period or subsequently reserved for, our overall tax expense and effective tax rate could be adversely impacted in the period of adjustment.

On September 17, 2010, the Danish tax authorities issued a decision concluding that distributions declared in 2005 and 2006 from the
Company’s Danish subsidiary, for which the Company has not paid or accrued any taxes, are subject to Danish at-source dividend withholding tax. The Company believes the assessment is without merit and has appealed this assessment decision with
the Danish National Tax Tribunal.

information it receives from its internal management system about revenues by geographic region, based on the location from which the customer relationship is managed, for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. We do
not allocate costs of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing, or general and administrative expenses to our geographic regions in this internal management system because management does not review operations or operating results, or
make planning decisions, below the consolidated entity level.

Operating Leases —

We lease office space in several U.S. locations. Outside the United
States, larger leased sites include sites in The Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, India, Japan, and the United Kingdom. We also lease equipment and vehicles.

As of April 29, 2011, we have four leasing arrangements (Leasing Arrangements 1, 2, 3 and 4) with BNPPLC which require us to lease certain portions of our land to BNPPLC for a period of 99 years and
to lease approximately 0.6 million square feet of office space for our headquarters in Sunnyvale, which had an original cost of $149.6 million. Under these leasing arrangements, we pay BNPPLC minimum lease payments, which vary based on LIBOR
plus a spread or a fixed rate on the costs of the facilities on the respective lease commencement dates. We make payments for each of the leases for a term of five years. We have the option to renew each of one of the following options:
(i) purchase the buildings from BNPPLC at cost; (ii) if certain conditions are met, arrange for the sale of the buildings by BNPPLC to a third party for an amount equal to at least 85% of the costs (residual guarantee), and be liable for
any deficiency between the net proceeds received from the third party and such amounts; or (iii) pay BNPPLC supplemental payments for an amount equal to at least 85% of the costs (residual guarantee), in which event we may recoup some or all of
such payments by arranging for a sale of each or all buildings by BNPPLC during the ensuing two-year period. The following table summarizes the costs, the residual guarantee, the applicable LIBOR plus spread or fixed rate at April 29, 2011 and
the date we began to make payments for each of our leasing arrangements (in millions):

These leases require us to
maintain specified financial covenants with which we were in compliance as of April 29, 2011. Such financial covenants include a maximum ratio of Total Debt to Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization of less than three to
one and a minimum amount of Unencumbered Cash and Short-Term Investments of $300 million.

Future annual minimum lease payments under all noncancelable operating leases with an
initial term in excess of one year as of April 29, 2011 are as follows (in millions):

Included in real estate lease payments pursuant to four financing arrangements with BNP Paribas Leasing
Corporation (BNPPLC) are (i) lease commitments, which are based on the LIBOR rate at April 29, 2011 plus a spread or a fixed rate, for terms of five years; and (ii) included in the amount for fiscal year 2013 at the expiration or
termination of the lease, a supplemental payment obligation equal to our minimum guarantee of $127.1 million in the event that we elect not to purchase or arrange for sale of the buildings.

As of April 29, 2011, we estimated that the fair value of the properties under synthetic lease was $35.8 million less than their
aggregate residual guarantees. We are accruing for this deficiency over the remaining terms of the respective leases. As of April 29, 2011, a deficiency reserve of $16.1 million was included in other long-term liabilities.

Rent expense in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was as follows (in millions):

Purchase Orders and Other Commitments

In the normal course of business we make commitments to our third party contract manufacturers, to manage manufacturer lead times and meet
product forecasts, and to other parties, to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. We establish accruals for estimated losses on purchased components to the extent we believe it is probable that such components will
not be utilized in future operations. To the extent that such forecasts are not achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may change. We had $176.0 million in non-cancelable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers as of
April 29, 2011. In addition, we recorded a liability for firm non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts through a charge to product cost of sales.
As of April 29, 2011 and April 30, 2010, such liability amounted to $4.5 million and $3.8 million, respectively, and is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

In addition to commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers, we have open purchase orders and contractual obligations
associated with our ordinary course business for which we have not received goods or services. We had $36.1 million in capital purchase commitments and $270.0 million in other purchase commitments as of April 29, 2011.



NETAPP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

During the ordinary course of business, we provide standby letters of credit or other
guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by us or our subsidiaries. As of April 29, 2011, our financial guarantees of $5.3 million that were not recorded on our balance sheet consisted of
standby letters of credit related to workers’ compensation, a customs guarantee, a corporate credit card program, foreign rent guarantees and surety bonds.

Product Warranties

We provide customers a warranty on software of
ninety days and a warranty on hardware of three years. The following table summarizes our warranty reserves (in millions):

Financing Guarantees

We have both nonrecourse and recourse lease financing arrangements with third-party leasing companies through new and preexisting relationships with customers. In addition, from time to time we provide
guarantees for a portion of other financing arrangements under which we could be called upon to make payments to our third-party funding companies in the event of nonpayment by end-user customers. Under the terms of the nonrecourse leases, we do not
have any continuing obligations or liabilities to the third-party leasing companies. Under the terms of the recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the
third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default. These arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenues associated with the
end-user financing arrangement in accordance with our revenue recognition policies. As of April 29, 2011, the maximum guaranteed payment contingencies under our financing arrangements totaled approximately $89.0 million, and the related
deferred revenue and cost of revenues totaled approximately $87.7 million and $7.6 million, respectively. To date, we have not experienced material losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements.

Indemnification Agreements

We enter into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, we agree to defend and indemnify other parties, primarily our customers or business
partners or subcontractors, for damages and reasonable costs incurred in any suit or claim brought against them alleging that our products sold to them infringe any U.S. patent, copyright, trade secret, or similar right. If a product becomes
the subject of an infringement claim, we may, at our option: (i) replace the product with another noninfringing product that provides substantially similar performance; (ii) modify the infringing product so that it no longer infringes but
remains functionally equivalent; (iii) obtain the right for the customer to continue using the product at our expense and for the reseller to continue selling the product; (iv) take back the infringing product and refund to customer the
purchase price paid less depreciation amortized on a straight-line basis. We have not been required to make material payments pursuant to these provisions historically. We have not recorded any liability at April 29, 2011 related to these
guarantees since the maximum amount of potential future payments under such guarantees, indemnities and warranties is not determinable, other than as described above.



NETAPP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Legal Contingencies

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which may arise in the normal course of business. No accrual has been recorded as
of April 29, 2011, as the outcome of these legal matters is currently not determinable.

On October 13, 2010,
Amalgamated Bank (as trustee of the Longview Largecap 500 Index Fund and the Longview Largecap 500 Index Veba Fund) filed a derivative lawsuit on behalf of NetApp, Inc. and NetApp U.S. Public Sector, Inc. in the Superior Court of the State of
California, Santa Clara County. The lawsuit named 15 of our current and former directors as defendants. On February 3, 2011, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint in response to motions to dismiss that we and the individual defendants had
filed. Like the original complaint, the amended complaint includes claims of breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets and alleges that the defendants failed to monitor internal controls to ensure that we complied with legal
requirements in our General Services Administration (GSA) contracting activities, resulting in us incurring defense and settlement costs. The amended complaint seeks disgorgement of salaries and other compensation from the defendants and additional
unspecified damages. We and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint in early March 2011, and the hearing on these motions is scheduled for July 15, 2011.

19. Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

The amounts previously reported in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for fiscal 2011 have been adjusted to reflect the retrospective adoption of new revenue

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(2)

As a result of the adoption of new revenue recognition accounting standards, fourth quarter fiscal 2011 net revenues and net income were higher by $48.2 million and
$19.4 million, respectively

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we identified classification errors in
previously issued interim condensed consolidated balance sheets as of October 29, 2010 and January 28, 2011, related to our 1.75% convertible senior notes due June 2013 (the “Notes”) which had met the conversion threshold set forth in the
Notes. See note 10 for the further discussion regarding the Notes. The Notes were previously reported as a long term liability of $1,125.4 million and $1,137.7 million as of October 29, 2010 and January 28, 2011, and should have been
reflected as a current liability. In addition $139.6 million and $127.3 million as of October 29, 2010 and January 28, 2011, respectively, was recorded within additional paid-in-capital and should have been presented as temporary equity.
Management has determined that the foregoing errors are not material to the previously issued interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company made these reclassifications in the consolidated balance sheet as of April 29, 2011,
and will prospectively correct the classification errors in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements during fiscal 2012. The errors did not affect the previously reported results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

20. Subsequent Event

On May 6, 2011, we completed the acquisition of certain assets related to the Engenio external storage systems business (ESG) of LSI
Corporation (LSI). We paid LSI $480 million in cash and also assumed certain assets and liabilities related to ESG. Over the next three years, LSI will pay us between $13.0 million and $14.5 million to service certain LSI customer warranties. This
acquisition will enable us to address emerging and fast-growing market segments such as video, including full-motion video capture and digital video surveillance, as well as high performance computing applications, such as genomics sequencing and
scientific research.

We are in the process of completing a purchase price allocation for this acquisition. We currently
expect between $250.0 million and $350.0 million of the purchase price to be allocated to identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill in the final purchase price allocation. A preliminary purchase price allocation is currently expected to be
included in our consolidated financial statements for the quarter ending July 29, 2011.

The following unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial information gives effect to the acquisition of ESG as if it were consummated on April 25, 2009. Due to differing fiscal year ends of NetApp and ESG, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information is based on the historical results of NetApp for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively and the historical results of ESG for the twelve month periods ended April 3, 2011 and April 4, 2010, respectively. The unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of operations of the Company that would have been reported had the acquisition occurred on
April 25, 2009 (the beginning of the earliest period presented) and should not be taken as representative of future consolidated results of operations of the combined company (in millions).

An adjustment of $2.5 million has been reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined information
to exclude acquisition related costs directly attributable to the acquisition because they will not have a continuing impact on the combined results.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls are procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act),
such as this Annual Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded as of the Evaluation Date
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information relating to NetApp, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reports (i) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to NetApp’s management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of April 29, 2011, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 29, 2011 has been audited by Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

(c) Changes in Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with management’s evaluation during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially effect, our internal control over financial
reporting.



(d) Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

NetApp, Inc.

Sunnyvale, California

We have
audited the internal control over financial reporting of NetApp, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of April 29, 2011, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or
fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 29, 2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended April 29, 2011 of the Company and our report dated June 23, 2011 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph relating to the change in the Company’s method for recognizing revenue for multiple element arrangements.
