PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

Founded in 1935, Tyson Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) are one of
the world’s largest meat protein companies and the second-largest food production company in the

Fortune

500 with one of the most recognized brand names in the food industry. We produce, distribute and market chicken, beef, pork,
prepared foods and related allied products. Our operations are conducted in four segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. Some of the key factors influencing our business are customer demand for our products; the ability to maintain and
grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace; accessibility of international markets; market prices for our products; the cost of live cattle and hogs, raw materials, grain and feed ingredients; and
operating efficiencies of our facilities.

We operate a fully vertically integrated poultry production process. Our integrated operations
consist of breeding stock, contract growers, feed production, processing, further-processing, marketing and transportation of chicken and related allied products, including animal and pet food ingredients. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary,
Cobb-Vantress, Inc. (Cobb), we are one of the leading poultry breeding stock suppliers in the world. Investing in breeding stock research and development allows us to breed into our flocks the characteristics found to be most desirable.

We also process live fed cattle and hogs and fabricate dressed beef and pork carcasses into primal and sub-primal meat cuts, case ready beef and pork and
fully-cooked meats. In addition, we derive value from allied products such as hides and variety meats sold to further processors and others.

We produce a wide range of fresh, value-added, frozen and refrigerated food products. Our products are marketed and sold primarily by our sales staff to
grocery retailers, grocery wholesalers, meat distributors, warehouse club stores, military commissaries, industrial food processing companies, chain restaurants or their distributors, international export companies and domestic distributors who
serve restaurants, foodservice operations such as plant and school cafeterias, convenience stores, hospitals and other vendors. Additionally, sales to the military and a portion of sales to international markets are made through independent brokers
and trading companies.

We have been exploring ways to commercialize our supply of poultry litter and animal fats. In June 2007, we announced
a 50/50 joint venture with Syntroleum Corporation, called Dynamic Fuels LLC (Dynamic Fuels). Dynamic Fuels produces renewable synthetic fuels targeting the renewable diesel and jet fuel markets. Construction of production facilities was completed in
late fiscal 2010, and initial production began in October 2010.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF SEGMENTS

We operate in four segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. The contribution of each segment to net sales and operating income (loss), and the
identifiable assets attributable to each segment, are set forth in Note 16: Segment Reporting of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

DESCRIPTION OF SEGMENTS

Chicken:

Chicken operations include breeding and raising
chickens, as well as processing live chickens into fresh, frozen and value-added chicken products and logistics operations to move products through the supply chain. Products are marketed domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors,
restaurant operators, hotel chains and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well as to international markets. It also includes sales from allied products and our
chicken breeding stock subsidiary.

Beef:

Beef operations include processing live fed cattle and fabricating dressed beef carcasses
into primal and sub-primal meat cuts and case-ready products. This segment also includes sales from allied products such as hides and variety meats, as well as logistics operations to move products through the supply chain. Products are marketed
domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors, restaurant operators, hotel chains and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well as to international
markets. Allied products are marketed to manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and technical products.

facilities, the military and other food processors, as well as to international markets.

The results from Dynamic Fuels are included in
Other.

RAW MATERIALS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY

Chicken:

The primary raw materials used in our chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract growers. Our
vertically-integrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing. Breeder flocks (i.e., grandparents) are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are
produced. Fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets (i.e., parents). Pullets are sent to breeder houses, and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries. Once chicks have hatched, they are sent to broiler farms.
There, contract growers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards, with advice from our technical service personnel, until the broilers reach the desired processing weight. Adult chickens are transported to processing plants, which
are slaughtered and converted into finished products, then sent to distribution centers and delivered to customers.

We operate our own feed
mills to produce scientifically-formulated feeds. In fiscal 2011, corn, soybean meal and other feed ingredients were major production costs, representing roughly 69% of our cost of growing a live chicken. In addition to feed ingredients to grow the
chickens, we use cooking ingredients, packaging materials and cryogenic agents. We believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs, and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the
future. While we produce nearly all our inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers, we also purchase live, ice-packed or deboned chicken to meet production and sales requirements.

Beef:

The primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle. We do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle but employ cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas
who visit independent feed yards and public auctions and buy live cattle on the open spot market. These buyers are trained to select high quality animals, and we continually measure their performance. We also enter into various risk-sharing and
procurement arrangements with producers to secure a supply of livestock for our facilities. We believe the sources of supply of live cattle are adequate for our present needs.

Pork:

The primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs. The majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement relationships with independent producers. We
employ buyers who make purchase agreements of various time durations as well as purchase hogs on a daily basis, generally a few days before the animals are processed. These buyers are trained to select high quality animals, and we continually
measure their performance. We believe the sources of supply of live hogs are adequate for our present needs. Additionally, we raise a number of weanling swine to sell to independent finishers and supply a minimal amount of live swine for our own
processing needs.

Prepared Foods:

The primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commodity based raw
materials, including chicken, beef, pork, corn, flour and vegetables. Some of these raw materials are provided by our other segments, while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers. We believe the sources of supply of raw
materials are adequate for our present needs.

SEASONAL DEMAND

Demand for chicken and beef products generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months. Pork and prepared foods products generally experience
increased demand during the winter months, primarily due to the holiday season, while demand decreases during the spring and summer months.

CUSTOMERS

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
accounted for 13.3% of our fiscal 2011 consolidated sales. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. were included in the Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods segments. Any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could, if not replaced, have a
material impact on our operations. No other single customer or customer group represented more than 10% of fiscal 2011 consolidated sales.



COMPETITION

Our food products compete with those of other food producers and processors and certain prepared food manufacturers. Additionally, our food products compete in markets around the world.

We seek to achieve a leading market position for our products via our principal marketing and competitive strategy, which includes:

—

identifying target markets for value-added products;

—

concentrating production, sales and marketing efforts to appeal to and enhance demand from those markets; and

—

utilizing our national distribution systems and customer support services.

Past efforts indicate customer demand can be increased and sustained through application of our marketing strategy, as supported by our distribution systems. The principal competitive elements are price,
product safety and quality, brand identification, breadth and depth of product offerings, availability of products, customer service and credit terms.

INTERNATIONAL

We sold products to more than 130 countries in fiscal 2011. Major sales
markets include Canada, Central America, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.

We have the following international operations:

—

Tyson de Mexico, a Mexican subsidiary, is a vertically-integrated poultry production company;

—

Cobb-Vantress, a chicken breeding stock subsidiary, has business interests in Argentina, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, India, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Peru,
the Philippines, Russia, Spain, Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom and Venezuela;

—

Tyson do Brazil, a Brazilian subsidiary, is a vertically-integrated poultry production company;

—

Shandong Tyson Xinchang Foods, a Chinese subsidiary, is a vertically-integrated poultry production company;

—

Tyson Dalong, a joint venture in China in which we have a majority interest, is a chicken further processing facility;

—

Jiangsu-Tyson, a Chinese poultry breeding subsidiary, is building a vertically-integrated poultry operation with production expected to begin in fiscal 2012;

—

Godrej Tyson Foods, a joint venture in India in which we have a majority interest, is a poultry processing business; and

—

Cactus Argentina, a minority interest in a vertically-integrated beef operation joint venture in Argentina; however, we do not consolidate the entity due to the lack of
controlling interest.

We continue to evaluate growth opportunities in foreign countries. Additional information regarding
export sales, long-lived assets located in foreign countries and income (loss) from foreign operations is set forth in Note 16: Segment Reporting of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

We conduct
continuous research and development activities to improve product development, to automate manual processes in our processing plants and growout operations, and to improve chicken breeding stock. In 2007, we opened the Discovery Center, which
includes 19 research kitchens and a USDA-inspected pilot plant. The Discovery Center brings new market-leading retail and foodservice products to the customer faster and more effectively. Research and development costs totaled $42 million, $38
million and $33 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION AND FOOD SAFETY

Our facilities for processing chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods, milling feed and housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of
federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which include provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and generally provide for protection of the environment. We believe we are in substantial compliance
with such applicable laws and regulations and are not aware of any violations of such laws and regulations likely to result in material penalties or material increases in compliance costs. The cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has
not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and except as described below, is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future.

Congress and the United States Environmental Protection Agency are considering various options to control greenhouse gas emissions. It is unclear at this
time when or if such options will be finalized, or what the final form may be. Due to the uncertainty surrounding this issue, it is premature to speculate on the specific nature of impacts that imposition of greenhouse gas emission controls would
have on us, and whether such impacts would have a material adverse effect.



We work to ensure our products meet high standards of food safety and quality. In addition to our own
internal Food Safety and Quality Assurance oversight and review, our chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods products are subject to inspection prior to distribution, primarily by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the United
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We are also participants in the United States Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) program and are subject to the Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures and the Public Health Security and
Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002.

EMPLOYEES AND LABOR RELATIONS

As of October 1, 2011, we employed approximately 115,000 employees. Approximately 97,000 employees were employed in the United States and 18,000
employees were in foreign countries, primarily China, Mexico and Brazil. Approximately 29,000 employees in the United States were subject to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions, with approximately 40% of those employees
included under agreements expiring in fiscal 2012. The remaining agreements expire over the next several years. Approximately 7,000 employees in foreign countries were subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe our overall relations
with our workforce are good.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

Our principal marketing objective is to be the primary provider of chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods products for our customers and consumers. As such, we utilize our national distribution system and
customer support services to achieve the leading market position for our products. On an ongoing basis, we identify distinct markets and business opportunities through continuous consumer and market research. In addition to supporting strong
regional brands across multiple protein lines, we build the Tyson brand and Tyson owned brands primarily through well-defined product-specific advertising and public relations efforts focused toward key consumer targets with specific needs. These
efforts are designed to present key Tyson products as everyday solutions to relevant consumer problems thereby becoming part of regular eating routines.

We have the ability to produce and ship fresh, frozen and refrigerated products worldwide. Domestically, our distribution system extends to a broad network of food distributors and is supported by our
owned or leased cold storage warehouses, public cold storage facilities and our transportation system. Our distribution centers accumulate fresh and frozen products so we can fill and consolidate less-than-truckload orders into full truckloads,
thereby decreasing shipping costs while increasing customer service. In addition, we provide our customers a wide selection of products that do not require large volume orders. Our distribution system enables us to supply large or small quantities
of products to meet customer requirements anywhere in the continental United States. Internationally, we utilize both rail and truck refrigerated transportation to domestic ports, where consolidations take place to transport to foreign destinations.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We
have filed a number of patents and trademarks relating to our processes and products that either have been approved or are in the process of application. Because we do a significant amount of brand name and product line advertising to promote our
products, we consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our marketing efforts. We also have developed non-public proprietary information regarding our production processes and other product-related matters. We utilize internal
procedures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality of such information and, where appropriate, seek patent and/or trademark protection for the technology we utilize.

INDUSTRY PRACTICES

Our agreements with customers are generally short-term, primarily due
to the nature of our products, industry practices and fluctuations in supply, demand and price for such products. In certain instances where we are selling further processed products to large customers, we may enter into written agreements whereby
we will act as the exclusive or preferred supplier to the customer, with pricing terms that are either fixed or variable.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF “SAFE HARBOR”
PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

Certain information in this report constitutes forward-looking
statements. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, current views and estimates of our outlook for fiscal 2012, other future economic circumstances, industry conditions in domestic and international markets, our performance
and financial results (e.g., debt levels, return on invested capital, value-added product growth, capital expenditures, tax rates, access to foreign markets and dividend policy). These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of factors
and uncertainties that could cause our actual results and experiences to differ materially from anticipated results and expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Among the factors that may cause actual results and experiences to differ from anticipated results and expectations expressed in such forward-looking
statements are the following: (i) the effect of, or changes in, general economic conditions; (ii) fluctuations in the cost and availability of inputs and raw materials, such as live cattle, live swine, feed grains (including corn and
soybean meal) and energy; (iii) market conditions for finished products, including competition from other global and domestic food processors, supply and pricing of competing products and alternative proteins and demand for alternative
proteins; (iv) successful rationalization of existing facilities and operating efficiencies of the facilities; (v) risks associated with our commodity purchasing activities; (vi) access to foreign markets together with foreign
economic conditions, including currency fluctuations, import/export restrictions and foreign politics; (vii) outbreak of a livestock disease (such as avian influenza (AI) or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)), which could have an adverse
effect on livestock we own, the availability of livestock we purchase, consumer perception of certain protein products or our ability to access certain domestic and foreign markets; (viii) changes in availability and relative costs of labor and
contract growers and our ability to maintain good relationships with employees, labor unions, contract growers and independent producers providing us livestock; (ix) issues related to food safety, including costs resulting from product recalls,
regulatory compliance and any related claims or litigation; (x) changes in consumer preference and diets and our ability to identify and react to consumer trends; (xi) significant marketing plan changes by large customers or loss of one or
more large customers; (xii) adverse results from litigation; (xiii) risks associated with leverage, including cost increases due to rising interest rates or changes in debt ratings or outlook; (xiv) compliance with and changes to
regulations and laws (both domestic and foreign), including changes in accounting standards, tax laws, environmental laws, agricultural laws and occupational, health and safety laws; (xv) our ability to make effective acquisitions or joint
ventures and successfully integrate newly acquired businesses into existing operations; (xvi) effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs; and (xvii) those factors listed under Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

These risks, which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials, especially feed grains, live cattle, live swine and other inputs could
negatively impact our earnings.

Our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the cost and supply of raw materials
such as feed grains, live cattle, live swine, energy and ingredients, as well as the selling prices for our products, many of which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control.
Corn, soybean meal and other feed ingredients are major production costs for vertically-integrated poultry processors such as us, representing roughly 69% of our cost of growing a live chicken in fiscal 2011. As a result, fluctuations in prices for
these feed ingredients, which include competing demand for corn and soybean meal for use in the manufacture of renewable energy, can adversely affect our earnings. Production of feed ingredients is affected by, among other things, weather patterns
throughout the world, the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients, as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments.

We have cattle under contract at feed yards owned by third parties; however, most of the cattle we process are purchased from independent producers. We have cattle buyers located throughout cattle
producing areas who visit feed yards and buy live cattle on the open spot market. We also enter into various risk-sharing and procurement arrangements with producers who help secure a supply of livestock for daily start-up operations at our
facilities. The majority of our live swine supply is obtained through procurement arrangements with independent producers. We also employ buyers who purchase hogs on a daily basis, generally a few days before the animals are required for processing.
In addition, we raise live swine and sell feeder pigs to independent producers for feeding to processing weight and have contract growers feed a minimal amount of company-owned live swine for our own processing needs. Any decrease in the supply of
cattle or swine on the spot market could increase the price of these raw materials and further increase per head cost of production due to lower capacity utilization, which could adversely affect our financial results.



Market supply and demand and the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from
other food producers and processors.

We face competition from other food producers and processors. Some of the factors on which we compete
and which may drive demand for our products include:

—

price;

—

product safety and quality;

—

brand identification;

—

breadth and depth of product offerings;

—

availability of our products and competing products;

—

customer service; and

—

credit terms.

Demand for our products also is
affected by competitors’ promotional spending, the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing programs, and the availability or price of competing proteins.

We attempt to obtain prices for our products that reflect, in part, the price we must pay for the raw materials that go into our products. If we are not able to obtain higher prices for our products when
the price we pay for raw materials increases, we may be unable to maintain positive margins.

Outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely
impact our ability to conduct our operations and demand for our products.

Demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks
of livestock diseases, which can have a significant impact on our financial results. Efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of
livestock. However, outbreaks of disease and other events, which may be beyond our control, either in our own livestock or cattle and hogs owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us, could significantly affect demand for our products,
consumer perceptions of certain protein products, the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations. Moreover, the outbreak of livestock diseases, particularly in our Chicken segment, could have a significant
effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to, among other things, destroy any affected livestock. Furthermore, an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our products to or from our suppliers,
facilities or customers. This could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results.

We are subject to risks associated with our international operations, which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries, as well as our operations and assets in such countries.

In fiscal 2011, we sold products to more than 130 countries. Major sales markets include Canada, Central America, China, the European
Union, Japan, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Our sales to customers in foreign countries for fiscal 2011 totaled $5.5 billion, of which $4.1 billion related to export sales from the United States. In addition, we
had approximately $539 million of long-lived assets located in foreign countries, primarily Brazil, China, Mexico and India, at the end of fiscal 2011.

As a result, we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including:

—

imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other trade protection measures imposed by foreign countries regarding the importation of poultry, beef and pork
products, in addition to import or export licensing requirements imposed by various foreign countries;

—

closing of borders by foreign countries to the import of poultry, beef and pork products due to animal disease or other perceived health or safety issues;

—

impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, particularly the Brazilian real, the British pound sterling, the Canadian
dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the European euro, and the Mexican peso;

—

political and economic conditions;

—

difficulties and costs associated in complying with, and enforcement of remedies under, a wide variety of complex domestic and international laws, treaties and
regulations, including, without limitation, the United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and economic and trade sanctions enforced by the United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control;

—

different regulatory structures and unexpected changes in regulatory environments;

—

tax rates that may exceed those in the United States and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation;

—

potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and

—

distribution costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation.



Negative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to
transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our financial results.

We depend on the availability of, and good relations with, our employees.

We have
approximately 115,000 employees, approximately 36,000 of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions. Our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with
employees and the labor unions. If we fail to maintain good relations with our employees or with the labor unions, we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages, which could adversely affect our financial results.

We depend on contract growers and independent producers to supply us with livestock.

We contract primarily with independent contract growers to raise the live chickens processed in our poultry operations. A majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell
livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market. If we do not attract and maintain contracts with growers or maintain marketing and purchasing relationships with independent producers, our production operations could be negatively
affected.

If our products become contaminated, we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls.

Our products may be subject to contamination by disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella and E. coli. These
organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment; therefore, there is a risk that one or more, as a result of food processing, could be present in our products. These organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a
result of improper handling at the further processing, foodservice or consumer level. These risks may be controlled, but may not be eliminated, by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing. We have little, if any,
control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution. Even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims, product
recalls (which may not entirely mitigate the risk of product liability claims), increased scrutiny and penalties, including injunctive relief and plant closings, by federal and state regulatory agencies, and adverse publicity, which could exacerbate
the associated negative consumer reaction. Any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results.

Our operations
are subject to general risks of litigation.

We are involved on an on-going basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business
or otherwise. Trends in litigation may include class actions involving consumers, shareholders, employees or injured persons, and claims relating to commercial, labor, employment, antitrust, securities or environmental matters. Litigation trends and
the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could adversely affect our financial results.

Our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position.

Our indebtedness, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility, may increase from time to time for various reasons, including fluctuations in operating results, working capital needs, capital
expenditures and possible acquisitions, joint ventures or other significant initiatives. Our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because:

—

it may limit or impair our ability to obtain financing in the future;

—

our credit rating could restrict or impede our ability to access capital markets at desired interest rates and increase our borrowing costs;

—

it may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise;

—

a portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to interest payments on our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes; and

—

it may restrict our ability to pay dividends.

Our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens
and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; pay dividends or make other payments in respect of our capital stock; amend material documents; change the
nature of our business; make certain payments of debt; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into sale/leaseback or hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In addition, we are
required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum leverage ratios.

Our 10.50% Senior notes due March 2014 also contain
affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: incur additional debt and issue preferred stock; make certain investments and restricted payments; create liens; create restrictions on distributions
from subsidiaries; engage in specified sales of assets and subsidiary stock; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter new lines of business; engage in consolidation, mergers and acquisitions; and engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions.



An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of
operations and net worth.

Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment at least
annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. In assessing the carrying value of goodwill, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans,
economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors. Goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income
approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Under the income approach, we are required to make various judgmental
assumptions about appropriate discount rates. Disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions, could, among other things, cause us to increase the discount rate used in the goodwill valuations. We
could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or
sustained market capitalization declines. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future, which could be substantial. As of October 1, 2011, we had $1.9 billion of goodwill, which
represented approximately 17.1% of total assets.

Domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs.

Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards
and processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling and export of our products. Our facilities for processing chicken, beef, pork, prepared foods and milling feed and for housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety
of international, federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment, including provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, and to the health and safety of our employees. Our chicken, beef and
pork processing facilities are participants in the HACCP program and are subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. In addition, our products are subject to inspection prior to distribution,
primarily by the USDA and the FDA. Also, our livestock procurement and poultry growout activities are regulated by the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration, which is part of USDA’s Marketing and Regulatory Programs. Loss of
or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand, introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results.
Additionally, we are routinely subject to new or modified laws, regulations and accounting standards. If we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas, we could be subject to civil remedies,
including fines, injunctions, recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.

A material acquisition, joint venture or other significant initiative could affect our operations and financial condition.

We periodically evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures and other initiatives (collectively, “transactions”), and we may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies,
processing plants, technologies, products and services, which could include material transactions. A material transaction may involve a number of risks, including:

—

failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction;

—

difficulty integrating acquired businesses, technologies, operations and personnel with our existing business;

—

diversion of management attention in connection with negotiating transactions and integrating the businesses acquired;

—

exposure to unforeseen or undisclosed liabilities of acquired companies; and

—

the need to obtain additional debt or equity financing for any transaction.

We may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units. If we are unable to do this, such expansion could adversely affect our
financial results.

Market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions.

Our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions. We use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including
changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We hold certain positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures, that do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes. These positions are marked to fair value,
and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date. Therefore, losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results. While these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for
commodity products, the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices.

Deterioration
of economic conditions could negatively impact our business.

Our business may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions,
including inflation, interest rates, access to capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges) and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Any such changes could
adversely affect the demand for our products, or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials, cooking ingredients and packaging materials, thereby negatively affecting our financial results.



Disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions, could,
among other things:

—

make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or to refinance our debt in the future;

—

cause our lenders to depart from prior credit industry practice and make more difficult or expensive the granting of any amendment of, or waivers under, our credit
agreement to the extent we may seek them in the future;

—

impair the financial condition of some of our customers and suppliers thereby increasing customer bad debts or non-performance by suppliers;

—

negatively impact global demand for protein products, which could result in a reduction of sales, operating income and cash flows;

—

decrease the value of our investments in equity and debt securities, including our marketable debt securities, company-owned life insurance and pension and other
postretirement plan assets;

—

negatively impact our commodity purchasing activities if we are required to record losses related to derivative financial instruments; or

—

impair the financial viability of our insurers.

Changes in consumer preference could negatively impact our business.

The food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends, demands and preferences. Trends within the food industry change often, and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends
could lead to, among other things, reduced demand and price reductions for our products, and could have an adverse effect on our financial results.

The loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business.

Our
business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers’ plans and/or markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers, including, for example, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which
accounted for 13.3% of our sales in fiscal 2011. Many of our agreements with our customers are short-term, primarily due to the nature of our products, industry practice and the fluctuation in demand and price for our products.

The consolidation of customers could negatively impact our business.

Our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years, and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the United States and in other major
markets. These consolidations have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories, opposing price increases, and demanding lower pricing, increased promotional programs
and specifically tailored products. These customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products. Because of these trends, our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase
promotional spending for our products, any of which would adversely affect our financial results.

Extreme factors or forces beyond our
control could negatively impact our business.

Natural disasters, fire, bioterrorism, pandemic or extreme weather, including droughts,
floods, excessive cold or heat, hurricanes or other storms, could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages, fuel shortages, damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of
transportation channels, among other things. Any of these factors, as well as disruptions in our information systems, could have an adverse effect on our financial results.

Our renewable energy ventures and other initiatives might not be successful.

We have been
exploring ways to convert animal fats and other by-products from our operations into value-added products. For example, in fiscal 2007, we announced the formation of Dynamic Fuels, a joint venture with Syntroleum Corporation. We will continue to
explore other ways to commercialize opportunities outside our core business, such as renewable energy and other technologically-advanced platforms. These initiatives might not be as financially successful as we initially announced or might expect
due to factors that include, but are not limited to, possible discontinuance of tax credits, competing energy prices, failure to operate at the volumes anticipated, abilities of our joint venture partners and our limited experience in some of these
new areas.

Tyson Limited Partnership can exercise significant control.

As of October 1, 2011, Tyson Limited Partnership (the TLP) owns 99.97% of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, $0.10 par value (Class B stock) and the TLP and members of the Tyson family
own, in the aggregate, 2.45% of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, $0.10 par value (Class A stock), giving them, collectively, control of approximately 70.74% of the total voting power of the outstanding voting stock. At this time,
the TLP does not have a managing general partner, and, as such, the management rights of the managing general partner may be exercised by a majority of the percentage interests of the general partners. As of October 1, 2011, Mr. John
Tyson, Chairman of the Board of Directors, has 33.33% of the general partner percentage interests, and Ms. Barbara Tyson, a director of the Company, has 11.115% general partner percentage interests (the remaining general partnership interests
are held by the Tyson Partnership Interest Trust (44.44%) and Harry C. Erwin, III (11.115%)). As a result of these holdings, positions and directorships, the partners in the TLP have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control
over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders, including amendments to our restated



certificate of incorporation and by-laws, the election and removal of directors, any proposed merger,
consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock
price. Additionally, as a result of the Tyson family’s significant ownership of our outstanding voting stock, we rely on the “controlled company” exemption from certain corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange.

Capacity based on a five day week for Chicken and Prepared Foods, while Beef and Pork are based on a six day week.

Chicken:

Chicken processing plants include various phases of slaughtering, dressing, cutting, packaging, deboning and further-processing. We also
have 17 pet food operations, which are part of the Chicken processing plants. The blending mills, feed mills and broiler hatcheries have sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the chicken growout operations.

Beef:

Beef plants include various phases of slaughtering live cattle and fabricating beef products. Some also treat and tan hides. The Beef
segment includes three case-ready operations that share facilities with the Pork segment. One of the beef facilities contains a tallow refinery. Carcass facilities reduce live cattle to dressed carcass form. Processing facilities conduct fabricating
operations to produce boxed beef and allied products.

Pork:

Pork plants include various phases of slaughtering live hogs and
fabricating pork products and allied products. The Pork segment includes three case-ready operations that share facilities with the Beef segment.

Prepared Foods:

Prepared Foods plants process fresh and frozen chicken, beef, pork and other raw materials into pizza toppings, branded and processed meats, appetizers, prepared meals, ethnic
foods, soups, sauces, side dishes, pizza crusts, flour and corn tortilla products and meat dishes.

Our Dynamic Fuels joint venture produces
renewable synthetic fuels targeting the renewable diesel and jet fuel markets. Construction of production facilities was completed in late fiscal 2010, and initial production began in October 2010. Dynamic Fuels operates one plant with designed
annual capacity of 75 million gallons.



We believe our present facilities are generally adequate and suitable for our current purposes; however,
seasonal fluctuations in inventories and production may occur as a reaction to market demands for certain products. We regularly engage in construction and other capital improvement projects intended to expand capacity and improve the efficiency of
our processing and support facilities. We also consider the efficiencies of our operations and may from time to time consider changing the number or type of plants we operate to align with our capacity needs.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Refer to the description of certain legal proceedings pending against us under Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies, which discussion is
incorporated herein by reference. Listed below are certain additional legal proceedings involving the Company and/or its subsidiaries.

On
October 23, 2001, a putative class action lawsuit styled R. Lynn Thompson, et al. vs. Tyson Foods, Inc. was filed in the District Court for Mayes County, Oklahoma by three property owners on behalf of all owners of lakefront property on Grand
Lake O’ the Cherokees. Simmons Foods, Inc. and Peterson Farms, Inc. also are defendants. The plaintiffs allege the defendants’ operations diminished the water quality in the lake thereby interfering with the plaintiffs’ use and
enjoyment of their properties. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. While the District Court certified a class, on October 4, 2005, the
Court of Civil Appeals of the State of Oklahoma reversed, holding the plaintiffs’ claims were not suitable for disposition as a class action. This decision was upheld by the Oklahoma Supreme Court and the case was remanded to the District Court
with instructions that the matter proceed only on behalf of the three named plaintiffs. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, restitution and compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount in excess of $10,000. We and the other defendants
have denied liability and asserted various defenses. The defendants have requested a trial date, but the court has not yet scheduled the matter for trial.

Since 2003, nine lawsuits have been brought against us and several other poultry companies by approximately 150 plaintiffs in Washington County, Arkansas Circuit Court (Green v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et al.,
Bible v. Tyson Foods, Inc., Beal v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et al., McWhorter v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et al., McConnell v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et al., Carroll v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et al., Belew v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et al., Gonzalez v. Tyson Foods, Inc.,
et al., and Rasco v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et al.) alleging that the land application of poultry litter caused arsenic and pathogenic mold and fungi contamination of the air, soil and water in and around Prairie Grove, Arkansas and seeking recovery for
several types of personal injuries, including several forms of cancer. On August 2, 2006, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of Tyson and the other poultry company defendants in the first case to go to trial, which the plaintiffs
appealed, and the trial court stayed the remaining eight lawsuits pending the appeal. On May 8, 2008, the Arkansas Supreme Court reversed the summary judgment and remanded for a new trial. The remanded trial was held and the jury returned a
verdict in our favor. The plaintiffs appealed this verdict to the Arkansas Supreme Court, which affirmed the verdict and denied the plaintiffs’ petition for rehearing. The trial court has scheduled the second trial for October 22, 2012.

In 2010 our Mexican subsidiary, Tyson de Mexico (TdM), provided the National Water Commission (CONAGUA), an agency of the Mexican
government’s Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources, with information on TdM’s water usage for 2008 and 2009 at certain water wells that are part of TdM’s poultry production operations. In February 2011, the regional
CONAGUA office informed TdM that it was the regional CONAGUA office’s opinion that TdM’s permits for water usage from certain wells lapsed between the period of January 1, 2009 through May 5, 2009, and it estimated TdM owed
approximately 6.5 million pesos (approximately $560,000) for water usage during this period. TdM has had ongoing discussions with the regional CONAGUA office on this matter and is awaiting the regional office’s final determination.

In late 2010, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 7 began a Clean Air Act investigation of the company related to
operation and maintenance of ammonia refrigeration equipment at multiple facilities. The EPA subsequently referred the matter, which involves allegations of potential non-compliance with the Clean Air Act’s Risk Management Plan requirements at
15 Tyson facilities in Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska, to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). The EPA and DOJ have indicated they will seek monetary penalties (but the EPA and DOJ have not yet indicated an amount) and injunctive
relief requiring equipment and infrastructure changes at several facilities.

Other Matters:

We currently have approximately 115,000
employees and, at any time, have various employment practices matters outstanding. In the aggregate, these matters are significant to the Company, and we devote significant resources to managing employment issues. Additionally, we are subject to
other lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial amounts) arising out of the conduct of our business. While the ultimate results of these matters cannot be determined, they are not expected to have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY

We are one of the world’s largest meat protein companies and the second-largest food production company in the

Fortune

500 with one of the most recognized brand names in the food industry. We
produce, distribute and market chicken, beef, pork, prepared foods and related allied products. Our operations are conducted in four segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. Some of the key factors influencing our business are customer
demand for our products; the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace; accessibility of international markets; market prices for our products; the cost of live cattle and
hogs, raw materials, grain and feed ingredients; and operating efficiencies of our facilities.

OVERVIEW

—

General – As a result of improved internal performance, strong exports and favorable market conditions in our Beef and Pork segments, our
operating results remained strong in fiscal 2011 despite a $3.7 billion increase in input costs. The following are a few of the key drivers:

—

We continued to focus on maximizing our margins through margin management and operational efficiency improvements. Margin management improvements
occurred in the areas of mix, export sales, price optimization and value-added products initiatives. The operational efficiencies occurred in the areas of yields, cost reduction, labor management and logistics cost optimization.

—

Strong demand and exports in the Beef and Pork segments created a favorable pricing environment. While our Chicken segment remained profitable in
fiscal 2011, we were challenged by $675 million in increased grain and other feed ingredients costs, as well as excess industry supplies, which made it difficult to pass along the increased input costs. As a result of balancing our supply with
customer demand, we cut production after customer demand fell short of expectations. Recent USDA data indicates decreased egg sets, broiler chick placements and slaughter pounds. However, the impact of these production cuts, and the associated
impact on market prices, did not begin to materialize until late fourth quarter and into fiscal 2012.

—

With an operating margin of 4.0% in fiscal 2011, we have achieved operating margins of 4.0% or better in consecutive years for the first time since the
acquisition of IBP, inc. in 2001. The following is a summary of operating margins by segment:

—

Chicken – 1.5%

—

Beef – 3.5%

—

Pork – 10.3%

—

Prepared Foods – 3.6%

—

Debt and Liquidity – During fiscal 2011, we generated $1.0 billion of operating cash flows. Total debt declined $350 million in fiscal 2011 to
$2.2 billion, the lowest level since the acquisition of IBP, inc. Additionally, we repurchased, as part of our previously announced share repurchase program, 9.7 million shares of our stock for $170 million in fiscal 2011. At October 1,
2011, we had $1.6 billion of liquidity, which includes the availability under our credit facility and $716 million of cash and cash equivalents.

—

Our accounting cycle resulted in a 52-week year for both fiscal 2011 and 2010 and a 53-week year for fiscal 2009.




– Net income included the following items:

—

$11 million gain related to a sale of interests in an equity method investment; and

—

$21 million reduction to income tax expense related to a reversal of reserves for foreign uncertain tax positions.


– Net income included the following items:

—

$61 million in charges related to losses on notes repurchased during fiscal 2010;

—

$29 million non-cash, non-tax deductible charge related to a full goodwill impairment in an immaterial Chicken segment reporting unit;

—

$12 million non-cash, non-tax deductible charge related to the impairment of an equity method investment; and

—

$38 million gain from insurance proceeds.


– Net loss included the following items:

—

$560 million non-cash, non-tax deductible charge related to a goodwill impairment in our Beef segment; and

—

$15 million charge related to the closing of our Ponca City, Oklahoma, processed meats plant.

FISCAL 2012 OUTLOOK

USDA data indicates
overall domestic protein (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) production is expected to decrease in fiscal 2012. Because exports are likely to remain strong, we forecast total domestic availability of protein to be down 2-3% compared to fiscal 2011,
which should continue to support improved pricing. The following is a summary of the fiscal 2012 outlook for each of our segments, as well as an outlook on sales, capital expenditures, net interest expense, debt and liquidity and share repurchases:

—

Chicken

– For fiscal 2012, we expect industry production will decrease approximately 4% from fiscal 2011, which should gradually improve
market pricing conditions. Current futures prices indicate higher grain costs in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. We expect to offset the increased grain costs with operational, pricing and mix improvements. Our Chicken segment is currently
profitable and we expect it to strengthen throughout the year.

—

Beef

– We expect to see a gradual reduction in fed cattle supplies of 1-2% in fiscal 2012 as well as exports to remain strong as compared
to fiscal 2011. Despite reduced domestic availability, we expect adequate supplies in the regions we operate our plants. Although current weak industry fundamentals are challenging our Beef business, we expect it to be profitable in the first
quarter. We anticipate the fundamentals will strengthen throughout the year and our Beef segment will be in our normalized range for fiscal 2012.

—

Pork

– We expect hog supplies in fiscal 2012 to be comparable to fiscal 2011 and to be adequate in the regions in which we operate.
Additionally, we expect pork exports to remain strong in fiscal 2012. Based on these factors, we expect strong fundamentals in our Pork business to continue in fiscal 2012.

—

Prepared Foods

– We expect operational improvements and increased pricing to offset an anticipated increase in raw material costs. Because
many of our sales contracts are formula based or shorter-term in nature, we are typically able to offset rising input costs through increased pricing. However, there is a lag time for price increases to take effect. We expect improved Prepared Foods
profitability for fiscal 2012 primarily due to improvements in our lunchmeats business.

—

Sales

– We expect 2012 sales to exceed $34 billion mostly resulting from price increases related to decreases in domestic availability of
protein and rising raw material costs.

—

Capital Expenditures

– Our preliminary capital expenditures plan for fiscal 2012 is approximately $800-$850 million. We will continue to
make significant investments in our production facilities for high return operational efficiencies, other profit improvement projects and development of our foreign operations.

—

Net Interest Expense

– We expect fiscal 2012 net interest expense will be approximately $185 million, down $46 million compared to fiscal
2011.

—

Debt and Liquidity

– We do not have any significant maturities of debt coming due over the next two fiscal years and will continue to use
our available cash to repurchase notes when available at attractive rates. We plan to maintain total liquidity in excess of $1.2 billion.

—

Share Repurchases

– We expect to continue repurchasing shares under our previously announced share repurchase plan. In fiscal 2011, we
repurchased 9.7 million shares for approximately $170 million. As of October 1, 2011, 12.8 million shares remain authorized for repurchases. The timing and extent to which we repurchase shares will depend upon, among other things,
market conditions, liquidity targets, our debt obligations and regulatory requirements.



SUMMARY OF RESULTS – CONTINUING OPERATIONS

2011 vs. 2010 –

—

Average Sales Price

– The increase in sales was largely due to an increase in average sales prices, which accounted for an increase of
approximately $3.4 billion. While all segments had an increase in average sales prices mostly due to price increases associated with rising raw material costs, the majority of the increase was driven by the Beef and Pork segments.

—

Sales Volume

– Sales were positively impacted by an increase in sales volume, which accounted for an increase of $484 million. This was
primarily due to increases in the Chicken and Pork segments, partially offset by decreases in the Beef and Prepared Foods segments.

2010 vs. 2009 –

—

Average Sales Price

– The increase in sales was largely due to an increase in average sales prices, which accounted for an increase of
approximately $1.9 billion. While all segments had an increase in average sales prices, the majority of the increase was driven by the Beef and Pork segments.

—

Sales Volume

– Sales were negatively impacted by a decrease in sales volume, which accounted for a decrease of $150 million. This was
primarily due to an extra week in fiscal 2009 and the decrease in Pork segment sales volume, partially offset by an increase from a fiscal 2009 acquisition in the Chicken segment.

2011 vs. 2010 –

—

Cost of sales increased by approximately $4.1 billion. Higher input cost per pound increased cost of sales by approximately $3.7 billion, while higher
sales volume increased cost of sales $445 million.

—

The $3.7 billion impact of higher input costs per pound was primarily driven by:

—

Increase in average live cattle and hog costs of approximately $2.4 billion.

—

Increase in grain and feed ingredients of $675 million and increase in other growout operating costs of $74 million in our Chicken segment, which were
partially offset by approximately $200 million of operational improvements.

—

Increase in raw material costs of $273 million in our Prepared Foods segment.

—

The $0.4 billion impact of higher sales volumes was primarily driven by:

—

Increases in sales volume in our Chicken and Pork segments partially offset by decreases in our Beef and Prepared Foods segments.

—

Increase of $145 million of costs of sales associated with Dynamic Fuels, which commenced production activities in fiscal 2011.

2010 vs. 2009 –

—

Cost of sales increased $415 million. Higher cost per pound increased cost of sales by $558 million, partially offset by lower sales volume which
decreased cost of sales by $143 million.

—

Increase in average live cattle and hog costs of approximately $1.0 billion.

—

Increase due to net losses of $78 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to net gains of $191 million in fiscal 2009, from our commodity risk management
activities related to forward futures contracts for live cattle and hogs, and excludes the impact from related physical purchase transactions which impact current and future period operating results.

—

Increase in raw material costs of approximately $218 million in our Prepared Foods segment.

—

Increase in incentive-based compensation of approximately $97 million.

—

Decrease due to net losses of $6 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to net losses of $257 million in fiscal 2009, from our commodity risk management
activities related to grain and energy purchases, and excludes the impact from related physical purchase transactions which impact current and future period operating results.

—

Decrease in grain costs in the Chicken segment of approximately $158 million.

—

Decrease in the Chicken segment costs resulting from operational improvements.



2011 vs. 2010 –

—

Decrease of $13 million related to incentive-based compensation.

2010 vs. 2009 –

—

Increase of $118 million related to incentive-based compensation.

—

We perform our annual goodwill impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter. We estimate the
fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis. As further discussed in Critical Accounting Estimates, this analysis requires us to make various judgmental estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth
rates and discount factors.


– Includes the full impairment of an immaterial Chicken segment reporting unit.


– Includes the partial impairment of our Beef segment reporting unit.

Interest Income

in millions




$


$


$


2011/2010/2009

– Declines in interest income are primarily due to declines in cash balances
and interest rates. The declines in cash balances are primarily due to repurchases, retirement and redemption of senior notes, repurchases of Class A common stock under the reactivated share repurchase program and additions to property, plant
and equipment.



2011 vs. 2010 –

—

Cash interest expense included interest expense related to the coupon rates for senior notes and commitment/letter of credit fees incurred on our
revolving credit facilities. The decrease is due primarily to lower average weekly indebtedness of approximately 15%.

—

Losses on notes repurchased during fiscal 2011 and 2010 included the amount paid exceeding the carrying value of the notes repurchased, which primarily
included the repurchases of the 8.25% Notes due October 2011 (2011 Notes) and the 6.85% Senior notes due April 2016 (2016 Notes).

—

Non-cash interest expense primarily included interest related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts/premiums on note issuances. This
included debt issuance costs incurred on our revolving credit facility, the 10.50% Senior Notes due 2014 (2014 Notes) issued in March 2009, as well as the accretion of the debt discount on the 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (2013 Notes) and
2014 Notes.

2010 vs. 2009 –

—

Cash interest expense included interest expense related to the coupon rates for senior notes and commitment/letter of credit fees incurred on our
revolving credit facilities. The decrease is due to lower average weekly indebtedness of approximately 11%, partially offset by an increase in the overall average borrowing rates.

—

Losses on notes repurchased during fiscal 2010 included the amount paid exceeding the carrying value of the notes repurchased, which primarily included
the repurchases of the 2011 Notes and the 2016 Notes.

—

Non-cash interest expense primarily included interest related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts/premiums on note issuances. This
included debt issuance costs incurred on our revolving credit facility, the 2014 Notes, as well as the accretion of the debt discount on the 2013 Notes and 2014 Notes. Fiscal 2009 also includes expenses related to amendment fees paid in December
2008 on our then existing credit agreements.

SEGMENT RESULTS

We operate in four segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. The
following table is a summary of sales and operating income (loss), which is how we measure segment income (loss). Segment results exclude the results of our discontinued operation, Lakeside.




–

Operating income included a $38 million gain from insurance proceeds and a $29
million non-cash, non-tax deductible charge related to a full goodwill impairment of an immaterial Chicken segment reporting unit.

2011 vs. 2010 –

—

Sales Volume –

A 2.1% increase in slaughter pounds that mostly occurred in the first three quarters of fiscal 2011 and a reduction of
volumes in ending inventory in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily drove the 4.6% increase in sales volume for fiscal 2011.

—

Average Sales Price –

The increase in average sales prices is primarily due to mix changes and price increases associated with increased
input costs.

—

Operating Income –

—

Grain, Feed Ingredients and Growout Costs – Operating results were negatively impacted in fiscal 2011 by an increase in grain and feed ingredients
costs of $675 million and an increase in other growout operating costs of $74 million.

—

Operational Improvements – Operating results were positively impacted by approximately $200 million of operational improvements, primarily
attributed to improvements in yield, mix and processing optimization. These operational improvements were partially offset by an increase in operating costs, mostly from cooking ingredients and employee related costs.

—

Derivative Activities – Operating results included the following amounts for commodity risk management activities related to grain and energy
purchases. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical purchase transactions, which impact current and future period operating results.

2010 vs. 2009 –

—

Sales Volume –

The increase in sales volume for fiscal 2010 was due to sales volume related to a fiscal 2009 acquisition, partially offset
by a decrease due to the extra week in fiscal 2009.

—

Average Sales Price –

The increase in average sales prices is primarily due to sales mix changes associated with the reduced sales volume
of lower price per pound rendered products.

—

Operating Income (Loss) –

—

Operational Improvements – Operating results were positively impacted by operational improvements, which included: yield, mix and live production
performance improvements; additional processing flexibility; and reduced interplant product movement.

—

Derivative Activities – Operating results included the following amounts for commodity risk management activities related to grain and energy
purchases. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical purchase transactions, which impact current and future period operating results.

—

Grain Costs – Operating results were positively impacted in fiscal 2010 by a decrease in grain costs of $158 million.

—

Operating results included an increase in incentive-based compensation.



2009 –

Operating loss included a $560 million non-cash charge related to the partial
impairment of goodwill.

2011 vs. 2010 –

—

Sales and Operating Income –

—

Average sales price increased due to price increases associated with increased livestock costs. We have maintained strong operating income by
maximizing our revenues relative to the rising live cattle markets, partially attributable to strong export sales. This was offset by an increase in operating costs, primarily attributable to employee related costs.

—

Derivative Activities – Operating results included the following amounts for commodity risk management activities related to forward futures
contracts for live cattle. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical sale and purchase transactions, which impact current and future period operating results.

2010 vs. 2009 –

—

Sales and Operating Income (Loss) –

—

We increased our operating margins by maximizing our revenues relative to the rising live cattle markets, as well as improved our operating costs. In
addition, we had an improvement in our export sales. Operating results included an increase in incentive-based compensation.

—

Derivative Activities – Operating results included the following amounts for commodity risk management activities related to forward futures
contracts for live cattle. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical sale and purchase transactions, which impact current and future period operating results.



2011 vs. 2010 –

—

Sales and Operating Income –

—

Average sales price increased due to price increases associated with increased livestock costs. We have maintained strong operating income by
maximizing our revenues relative to the rising live hog markets, partially attributable to strong export sales and operational and mix performance.

—

Derivative Activities – Operating results included the following amounts for commodity risk management activities related to forward futures
contracts for live hogs. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical sale and purchase transactions, which impact current and future period operating results.

2010 vs. 2009 –

—

Sales and Operating Income –

—

We increased our operating margins by maximizing our revenues relative to the rising live hog markets. In addition, we had an improvement in our export
sales. Operating results included an increase in incentive-based compensation.

—

Derivative Activities – Operating results included the following amounts for commodity risk management activities related to forward futures
contracts for live hogs. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical sale and purchase transactions, which impact current and future period operating results.



2009 –

Operating income included a $15 million charge related to closing our Ponca City,
Oklahoma, processed meats plant.

2011 vs. 2010 –

—

Sales and Operating Income –

Despite the increase in average sales prices, operating income remained flat, excluding $8 million in
insurance proceeds in fiscal 2010 related to flood damage at our Jefferson, Wisconsin plant. The increase in average sales prices were offset by lower volumes, increased raw material costs of $273 million and increased operational costs of $50
million, primarily attributable to employee related costs and plant variances mostly due to lower volumes.

2010 vs. 2009 –

—

Sales and Operating Income –

Despite the increase in average sales prices and sales volume, operating income declined in fiscal 2010 as
compared to fiscal 2009 due to an increase in raw material costs. However, we made several operational improvements in late fiscal 2009 that allow us to run our plants more efficiently. Operating results included an increase in incentive-based
compensation.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, the repurchases of senior notes and share repurchases are expected to be met with current cash on hand, cash flows provided
by operating activities, or short-term borrowings. Based on our current expectations, we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business. However, we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional
liquidity or refinance existing debt through capital market transactions. The amount, nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on: our operating performance and other circumstances; our then-current commitments and
obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions.

Cash flows associated with changes in working capital:

—

2011 –

Decreased due to the increase in inventory and accounts receivable balances, partially offset by the increase in accounts payable.
The higher inventory and accounts receivable balances were driven by significant increases in input costs and price increases associated with the increased input costs.

—

2010 –

Increased due to the increase in accrued salaries, wages and benefits and accounts payable balances, almost entirely offset by the
increase in inventory and accounts receivable balances. The increase in accrued salaries, wages and benefits is primarily due to the accruals for incentive-based compensation.

—

2009 –

Increased primarily due to a reduction in inventory and accounts receivable balances, partially offset by a reduction in accounts
payable. The lower inventory balance was primarily due to the reduction of inventory volumes, as well as a decrease in raw material costs.



—

Additions to property, plant and equipment include acquiring new equipment and upgrading our facilities to maintain competitive standing and position
us for future opportunities. In fiscal 2011, our capital spending was primarily for production efficiencies in our operations and for ongoing development of foreign operations. In fiscal 2010, our capital spending was primarily related to production
efficiencies in our operations, construction of Dynamic Fuels’ facility and development of our foreign operations. In fiscal 2009, our capital spending was for improvements made in our prepared foods operations to increase efficiencies,
construction of Dynamic Fuels’ facility and development of our foreign operations.

—

Capital spending for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately $800-$850 million, and includes spending on our operations for production and labor
efficiencies, yield improvements and sales channel flexibility, as well as expansion of our foreign operations.

—

Purchases of marketable securities included funding for our deferred compensation plans.

—

Proceeds from notes receivable totaling $51 million in fiscal 2011 related to the collection of notes receivable received in conjunction with the sale
of a business operation in fiscal 2009.

—

Change in restricted cash – In fiscal 2009, Dynamic Fuels received $100 million in proceeds from the sale of Gulf Opportunity Zone tax-exempt
bonds made available by the federal government to the regions affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. The cash received from these bonds was restricted and could only be used towards the construction of the Dynamic Fuels’ facility.

—

Acquisitions – In fiscal 2009, we acquired three vertically integrated poultry companies in southern Brazil. The aggregate purchase price was $67
million. In addition, we had $15 million of contingent purchase price based on production volumes. The joint ventures in China called Shandong Tyson Xinchang Foods received the necessary government approvals during fiscal 2009. The aggregate
purchase price for our 60% equity interest was $21 million, which excludes $93 million of cash transferred to the joint venture for future capital needs.



—

Net borrowings (payments) on revolving credit facilities primarily include activity related to the accounts receivable securitization facility. With
the entry into a new revolving credit facility and issuance of the 2014 Notes in March 2009, we repaid all outstanding borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility and terminated the facility.

—

Payments on debt include –

—

2011 – $315 million of 2011 Notes; $63 million of 2016 Notes; $2 million of 7.0% Notes due May 2018; and $103 million related to borrowings at our
foreign operations.

—

2010 – $524 million of 2011 Notes; $222 million of 2016 Notes; $140 million of 7.95% Notes due February 2010 (2010 Notes) (using the restricted
cash held in a blocked cash collateral account for the retirement of these notes); $52 million of 7.0% Notes due May 2018; and $61 million related to the premiums on notes repurchased during the year.

—

2009 – $161 million of 2011 Notes; $94 million of 2010 Notes (using the restricted cash held in a blocked cash collateral account for the
repurchase of these notes); and $38 million of 2016 Notes.

—

Net proceeds from borrowings include –

—

In fiscal 2011, our foreign operations received proceeds of $106 million from borrowings. Total debt related to our foreign operations was $98 million
at October 1, 2011 ($58 million current, $40 million long-term). Additionally, Dynamic Fuels received $9 million in proceeds from short term notes in fiscal 2011.

—

In fiscal 2009, we issued $810 million of 2014 Notes. After the original issue discount of $59 million, based on an issue price of 92.756% of face
value, we received net proceeds of $751 million. We used the net proceeds towards the repayment of our borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility and for other general corporate purposes.

—

In fiscal 2009, Dynamic Fuels received $100 million in proceeds from the sale of Gulf Opportunity Zone tax-exempt bonds made available by the Federal
government to the regions affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. These floating rate bonds are due October 1, 2033.

—

In conjunction with the entry into our credit facility and the issuance of the 2014 Notes during fiscal 2009, we paid $48 million for debt issuance
costs.

—

In fiscal 2011, the minority interest partner in our 60%-owned Shandong Tyson Xinchang Foods joint ventures in China exercised put options requiring us
to purchase its entire 40% equity interest. The transaction closed in fiscal 2011 for cash consideration totaling $66 million.

—

In fiscal 2011, we announced our Board of Directors reactivated a share repurchase program, which had no activity since fiscal 2005, to repurchase up
to the remaining available 22.5 million shares of Class A common stock under the program. The share repurchase program has no fixed or scheduled termination date. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased 9.7 million shares for approximately
$170 million under this plan. As of October 1, 2011, 12.8 million shares remain authorized for repurchase. The timing and extent to which we repurchase shares will depend upon, among other things, market conditions, liquidity targets,
limitations under our debt obligations and regulatory requirements. In addition to the share repurchase program, we purchase shares on the open market to fund certain obligations under our equity compensation plans. These repurchases totaled $37
million, $48 million and $19 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.



—

The revolving credit facility supports our short-term funding needs and letters of credit. Letters of credit are issued primarily in support of
workers’ compensation insurance programs, derivative activities and Dynamic Fuels’ Gulf Opportunity Zone tax-exempt bonds.

—

Our 2013 Notes may be converted early during any fiscal quarter in the event our Class A stock trades at or above $21.96 for at least 20 trading
days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter. In this event, the note holders may require us to pay outstanding principal in cash, which totaled $458 million at October 1,
2011. Any conversion premium would be paid in shares of Class A stock. The conditions for early conversion were not met in our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2011, and thus, the notes may not be converted in our first quarter of fiscal 2012.
Should the conditions for early conversion be satisfied in future quarters, and should the holders exercise their early conversion option, we would use current cash on hand and cash flow from operations for principal payments.

—

We do not have any significant maturities of debt coming due over the next two fiscal years.

—

Our current ratio was 2.01 to 1 and 1.81 to 1 at October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, respectively.

Capital Resources

Credit Facility

Cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary source of liquidity for funding debt service, capital
expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. We also have a revolving credit facility, with a committed maximum capacity of $1.0 billion, to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs, letters of credit and a source of financing for
growth opportunities. As of October 1, 2011, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $158 million, none of which were drawn upon, which left $842 million available for borrowing. Our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of
38 banks, with commitments ranging from $3 million to $90 million per bank. The syndicate includes bank holding companies that are required to be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency requirements.

Capitalization

To monitor our credit
ratings and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. We monitor the ratio of our debt to our total capitalization as support for our long-term financing decisions. At October 1, 2011 and
October 2, 2010, the ratio of our debt-to-total capitalization was 27.7% and 32.8%, respectively. For the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of current and long-term debt. Total capitalization is defined as debt plus Total
Shareholders’ Equity. Our ratio of debt to our total capitalization decreased in fiscal 2011 primarily resulting from reduced debt balances and increased retained earnings associated with strong earnings in fiscal 2011.

Credit Ratings

2016 Notes

On September 4, 2008, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) downgraded the credit rating from “BBB-” to “BB.”
This downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 Notes from 6.85% to 7.35%, effective beginning with the six-month interest payment due October 1, 2008.

On November 13, 2008, Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. (Moody’s) downgraded the credit rating from “Ba1” to “Ba3.” This downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016
Notes from 7.35% to 7.85%, effective beginning with the six-month interest payment due April 1, 2009.

On August 19, 2010, S&P
upgraded the credit rating from “BB” to “BB+.” On September 2, 2010, Moody’s upgraded the credit rating from “Ba3” to “Ba2.” These upgrades decreased the interest rate on the 2016 Notes from 7.85% to
7.35%, effective beginning with the six-month interest payment due October 1, 2010.

On February 24, 2011, S&P upgraded the
credit rating of these notes from “BB+” to “BBB-.” On March 29, 2011, Moody’s upgraded our credit rating from “Ba2” to “Ba1”. These upgrades decreased the interest rate on the 2016 Notes from 7.35%
to 6.85%, effective beginning with the six-month interest payment due April 1, 2011.

A further one-notch upgrade by Moody’s would
decrease the interest rates on the 2016 Notes by 0.25%, while a one-notch downgrade by either ratings agency would increase the interest rates on the 2016 Notes by 0.25%.



Revolving Credit Facility

S&P’s corporate credit rating for Tyson Foods, Inc. is “BBB-.” Moody’s corporate credit rating for Tyson Foods, Inc. is “Ba1.” If Moody’s were to upgrade our credit
rating to “Baa2” or higher while our S&P credit rating remained at “BBB-”, or S&P were to upgrade our credit rating to “BBB” or higher while Moody’s upgraded our credit rating to “Baa3” or higher,
our letter of credit fees would decrease by 0.25% and fees paid on the unused portion of the facility would decrease by 0.075%.

If S&P
were to downgrade our corporate credit rating to “BB+” or Moody’s were to downgrade our corporate credit rating to “Ba2”, our letter of credit fees would increase by 0.25% and fees paid on the unused portion of the facility
would increase by 0.025%.

Debt Covenants

Our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve,
liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; pay dividends or make other payments in respect of our capital stock; amend material documents; change the nature of our business; make certain payments of
debt; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into sale/leaseback or hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In addition, we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage
and maximum leverage ratios.

Our 2014 Notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict
our ability to: incur additional debt and issue preferred stock; make certain investments and restricted payments; create liens; create restrictions on distributions from subsidiaries; engage in specified sales of assets and subsidiary stock; enter
into transactions with affiliates; enter new lines of business; engage in consolidation, mergers and acquisitions; and engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions.

We were in compliance with all debt covenants at October 1, 2011.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET
ARRANGEMENTS

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations. The
off-balance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties, including a lease and grower loans, and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. See Note 19: Commitments and
Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of October 1, 2011:

(1)

In the event of a default on payment, acceleration of the principal payments could occur.

(2)

Interest payments include interest on all outstanding debt. Payments are estimated for variable rate and variable term debt based on effective rates at October 1,
2011, and expected payment dates.

(3)

Amounts include guarantees of debt of outside third parties, which consist of a lease and grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying
assets, as well as residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. The amounts included are the maximum potential amount of future payments.

(4)

Amounts include minimum lease payments under lease agreements.

(5)

Amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum
quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligations amount included items, such as future purchase commitments for grains, livestock contracts and fixed
grower fees that provide terms that meet the above criteria. We have excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these criteria. Purchase orders have not been included in the table, as a purchase order is an authorization to
purchase and may not be considered an enforceable and legally binding contract. Contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also been excluded.

(6)

Amounts include estimated amounts to complete buildings and equipment under construction as of October 1, 2011.

(7)

Amounts include items that meet the definition of a purchase obligation and are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.



In addition to the amounts shown above in the table, we have unrecognized tax benefits of $174 million and
related interest and penalties of $58 million at October 1, 2011, recorded as liabilities. During fiscal 2012, tax audit resolutions could potentially reduce these amounts by approximately $10 million, either because tax positions are sustained
on audit or because we agree to their disallowance.

The maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at
October 1, 2011, based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier’s net tangible assets on that date, aggregated to approximately $220 million, or approximately $192 million remaining maximum commitment after netting the cash
flow assistance related receivables.

Policies for recently issued accounting pronouncements and Note 2: Change in Accounting Principles for recently adopted accounting pronouncements.



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of
certain accounting estimates we consider critical.







Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets

Description:

Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by
comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the
second step of the impairment test is not necessary. However, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to
recognize, if any.

The second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the implied fair
value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered impaired. However, if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination (i.e., the fair value
of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was determined as the
exit price a market participant would pay for the same business).

For other indefinite life intangible assets, if the carrying value of the
intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

We have elected to make the
first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets. However, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets
prior to the required annual assessment if, among other things, we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market
capitalization.

Judgments and Uncertainties:

We estimate the fair value of our reporting units, generally our operating segments,
using various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis, which uses significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us
to make various judgmental assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates.

We include assumptions about sales,
operating margins and growth rates which consider our budgets, business plans and economic projections, and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual
growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. Generally, we utilize normalized operating margin assumptions based on future expectations and operating margins historically realized in the reporting units’ industries. For
the fiscal 2011 impairment test of material reporting units, only our Domestic Chicken reporting unit utilized operating margins in future years in excess of the operating margin realized in the most recent year.

Our Domestic Chicken reporting unit had goodwill at October 1, 2011, totaling $900 million or 95% of our Chicken segment’s goodwill. We assumed
operating margins in future years would return to our normalized range of 5.0% to 7.0%, as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction. Had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in
the current fiscal year, we would have failed the first step of the annual impairment test, which would have required the second step to be performed and may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss. The current year Domestic Chicken
reporting unit results were not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction. In assessing the appropriate operating margins to be utilized in estimating the fair value of the Domestic Chicken segment, we considered
many factors, including the following:

•

The Domestic Chicken segment has realized significant operational improvements, including yield, mix, live production, processing flexibility, and
interplant product movements, over the past three years as compared to both historical results and the industry.

•

The operational improvements were offset in the current year due to historically high grain and feed ingredient costs coupled with excess supplies,
which made it difficult to pass along the increased input costs.

•

Recent USDA data indicates eggs sets, broiler chick placements and slaughter pounds are down significantly, which are all strong indicators that supply
relative to demand should return to more normalized levels by the end of fiscal 2012, allowing financial results to return to normalized ranges.

Other indefinite life intangible asset fair values have been calculated for trademarks using a royalty rate method. Assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar brands and
trademarks are licensed in the marketplace.

Our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively
or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.

Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions:

We
have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during the last three years.

The discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test increased to an average of 8.8% in fiscal 2011 from 8.4% in fiscal 2010. There were no significant changes in the other key estimates and
assumptions.

Other than the Beef reporting unit in 2009, no material reporting units failed the first step of the annual goodwill impairment
analysis in fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009 and therefore, the second step was not necessary. In fiscal 2009, we recorded a $560 million partial impairment of our Beef reporting unit’s goodwill, which was driven by an increase in our discount rate
used in the 2009 annual goodwill impairment analysis as a result of disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions. In fiscal 2010, we recorded a $29 million full impairment of an immaterial Chicken
segment reporting unit’s goodwill.

Some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units
are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, and our credit ratings. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and other
indefinite life intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, we may be required to perform the second step, which could
result in additional material impairments of our goodwill.

If the Domestic Chicken reporting unit experienced a 15% or more decline in fair
value at July 1, 2011, it would have caused the carrying value of the reporting unit to be in excess of fair value, which would have required the second step to be performed. Additionally, valuing the Domestic Chicken reporting unit utilizing
projected operating margins averaging less than 4.0%, or a 0.9% increase in the discount rate used in fiscal 2011, would have caused the carrying value of the Domestic Chicken reporting unit to be in excess of fair value, which would have required
the second step to be performed. The second step may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss. All other material reporting units’ estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20%. Consequently, we do not consider
any of our other material reporting units at significant risk of failing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment test.

Our fiscal
2011 other indefinite life intangible asset impairment analysis did not result in a material impairment charge. A hypothetical 20% decrease in the fair value of intangible assets would not result in a material impairment.



ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

MARKET RISK

Market
risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. To address certain of these risks, we enter into various derivative transactions as
described below. If a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or
firm commitments through earnings, or be recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value is recognized immediately. Additionally,
we hold certain positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges. With the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in
physical delivery, we record these positions at fair value, and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date. Changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to forward sales
contracts are recorded in sales. Changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales.

The sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related
to commodities. Sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes, nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity. Actual changes in market
prices may differ from hypothetical changes.

Commodities Risk:

We purchase certain commodities, such as grains and livestock, in the
course of normal operations. As part of our commodity risk management activities, we use derivative financial instruments, primarily futures and options, to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity.
However, as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations, any requirement to mark-to-market the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges could result in
volatility in our results of operations. Contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction
and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. The following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in market prices as of October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, on the fair value of
open positions. The fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. The market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and non-hedge derivative
financial instruments.



Interest Rate Risk:

At October 1, 2011, we had variable rate debt of $211 million with a
weighted average interest rate of 4.1%. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates effective at October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, would have a minimal effect on interest expense.

Additionally, changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixed-rate debt. At October 1, 2011, we had fixed-rate debt of $2.0 billion
with a weighted average interest rate of 9.2%. Market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value, resulting from a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would
have increased the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $5 million at October 1, 2011, and $9 million at October 2, 2010. The fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices and/or published interest
rates.

Foreign Currency Risk:

We have foreign exchange gain/loss exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances. The primary currency exchanges we have exposure to are the Brazilian real, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the European euro, and the Mexican
peso. We periodically enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates effective at October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010,
related to the foreign exchange forward and option contracts would have an $18 million and $17 million impact, respectively, on pretax income. In the future, we may enter into more foreign exchange forward and option contracts as a result of our
international growth strategy.

Concentrations of Credit Risk:

Our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk
consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables. Our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our
large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral. At October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010,
16.5% and 15.3%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable balance was due from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. No other single customer or customer group represented greater than 10% of net accounts receivable.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

TYSON FOODS, INC.

NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of Business:

Tyson Foods, Inc. (collectively, “Company,” “we,” “us” or
“our”), founded in 1935 with world headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas, is one of the world’s largest meat protein companies and the second-largest food production company in the

Fortune

500. We produce a wide variety of brand
name protein-based and prepared food products marketed in the United States and approximately 130 countries around the world.

Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control and,
when applicable, entities for which we have a controlling financial interest or are the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

We have an investment in a joint venture, Dynamic Fuels LLC (Dynamic Fuels), in which we have a 50 percent ownership interest. Dynamic Fuels qualifies as
a variable interest entity. We consolidate Dynamic Fuels since we are the primary beneficiary. At October 1, 2011, Dynamic Fuels had $170 million of total assets, of which $144 million was property, plant and equipment, and $116 million of
total liabilities, of which $100 million was long-term debt. At October 2, 2010, Dynamic Fuels had $154 million of total assets, of which $145 million was property, plant and equipment, and $107 million of total liabilities, of which $100
million was long-term debt.

Fiscal Year:

We utilize a 52- or 53-week accounting period ending on the Saturday closest to
September 30. The Company’s accounting cycle resulted in a 52-week year for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 and a 53-week year for fiscal year 2009.

Discontinued Operation:

On March 13, 2009, we completed the sale of the beef processing, cattle feed yard and fertilizer assets of three of our Alberta, Canada subsidiaries (collectively,
Lakeside), which were part of our Beef segment, and related inventories. The financial statements report Lakeside as a discontinued operation. See Note 3: Acquisitions and Discontinued Operation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash equivalents consist of investments in short-term, highly liquid securities
having original maturities of three months or less, which are made as part of our cash management activity. The carrying values of these assets approximate their fair values. We primarily utilize a cash management system with a series of separate
accounts consisting of lockbox accounts for receiving cash, concentration accounts where funds are moved to, and several zero-balance disbursement accounts for funding payroll, accounts payable, livestock procurement, grower payments, etc. As a
result of our cash management system, checks issued, but not presented to the banks for payment, may result in negative book cash balances. These negative book cash balances are included in accounts payable and other current liabilities. At
October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, checks outstanding in excess of related book cash balances totaled approximately $281 million and $267 million, respectively.

Accounts Receivable:

We record accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the
accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. We calculate this allowance based on our history of write-offs, level of past due accounts and relationships with and economic status of our customers. At
October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, our allowance for uncollectible accounts was $31 million and $32 million, respectively. We generally do not have collateral for our receivables, but we do periodically evaluate the credit worthiness of
our customers.

Inventories:

Processed products, livestock and supplies and other are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost
includes purchased raw materials, live purchase costs, growout costs (primarily feed, contract grower pay and catch and haul costs), labor and manufacturing and production overhead, which are related to the purchase and production of inventories.



Property, Plant and Equipment:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a
straight-line method, using estimated lives for buildings and leasehold improvements of 10 to 33 years, machinery and equipment of three to 12 years and land improvements and other of three to 20 years. Major repairs and maintenance costs that
significantly extend the useful life of the related assets are capitalized. Normal repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations.

We review the carrying value of long-lived assets at each balance sheet date if indication of impairment exists. Recoverability is assessed using
undiscounted cash flows based on historical results and current projections of earnings before interest and taxes. We measure impairment as the excess of carrying cost over the fair value of an asset. The fair value of an asset is measured using
discounted cash flows including market participant assumptions of future operating results and discount rates.

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets:

Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Our goodwill is
allocated by reporting unit, and we follow a two-step process to evaluate if a potential impairment exists. The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount,
including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. However, if the
carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of
goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered impaired. However, if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment
loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination (i.e., the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all
the assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was determined as the exit price a market participant would pay
for the same business). We have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets.

We have estimated the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis, which uses significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. This
analysis requires us to make various judgmental estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount factors and is believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Generally, we
utilize normalized operating margin assumptions based on future expectations and operating margins historically realized in the reporting units’ industries. For the fiscal 2011 impairment test of material reporting units, only our Domestic
Chicken reporting unit, which had goodwill at October 1, 2011 totaling $900 million, utilized operating margins in future years in excess of the operating margins realized in the most recent year. The current year Domestic Chicken reporting
unit results were not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction. We assumed operating margins in future years would return to our normalized range, as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in
an exit transaction. Some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, and credit ratings. While we
believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate
fair value, we may be required to perform the second step in future years, which could result in material impairments of our goodwill.

During
fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, all of our reporting units passed the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis, with the exception of an immaterial Chicken segment reporting unit in fiscal 2010 and the Beef reporting unit in fiscal 2009. In fiscal
2010, we recorded a $29 million full impairment of an immaterial Chicken segment reporting unit’s goodwill. In fiscal 2009, we recorded a $560 million partial impairment of our Beef reporting unit’s goodwill, which was driven by an
increase in our discount rate used in the 2009 annual goodwill impairment analysis as a result of disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions.

For our other indefinite life intangible assets, if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized
in an amount equal to that excess. The fair value of trademarks is determined using a royalty rate method based on expected revenues by trademark.

Investments:

We have investments in joint ventures and other entities. We use the cost method of accounting when our voting interests are less than 20 percent. We use the equity method of
accounting when our voting interests are in excess of 20 percent and we do not have a controlling interest or a variable interest in which we are the primary beneficiary. Investments in joint ventures and other entities are reported in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other Assets.



We also have investments in marketable debt securities. We have determined all of our marketable debt
securities are available-for-sale investments. These investments are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in other comprehensive income. The
amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization is recorded in interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized
gains and losses on the sale of debt securities and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are recorded on a net basis in other income. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded in interest
income.

Accrued Self Insurance:

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms in an effort to mitigate the potential
liabilities for health and welfare, workers’ compensation, auto liability and general liability risks. Liabilities associated with our risks retained are estimated, in part, by considering claims experience, demographic factors, severity
factors and other actuarial assumptions.

Capital Stock:

We have two classes of capital stock, Class A Common Stock, $0.10 par
value (Class A stock) and Class B Common Stock, $0.10 par value (Class B stock). Holders of Class B stock may convert such stock into Class A stock on a share-for-share basis. Holders of Class B stock are entitled to 10 votes per share, while
holders of Class A stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters submitted to shareholders for approval. As of October 1, 2011, Tyson Limited Partnership (the TLP) owned 99.97% of the outstanding shares of Class B stock and the TLP
and members of the Tyson family owned, in the aggregate, 2.45% of the outstanding shares of Class A stock, giving them, collectively, control of approximately 70.74% of the total voting power of the outstanding voting stock. Cash dividends
cannot be paid to holders of Class B stock unless they are simultaneously paid to holders of Class A stock. The per share amount of the cash dividend paid to holders of Class B stock cannot exceed 90% of the cash dividend simultaneously paid to
holders of Class A stock. We pay quarterly cash dividends to Class A and Class B shareholders. We paid Class A dividends per share of $0.16 and Class B dividends per share of $0.144 in each of fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009.

The Class B stock is considered a participating security requiring the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic earnings per
share. The two-class computation method for each period reflects the cash dividends paid for each class of stock, plus the amount of allocated undistributed earnings (losses) computed using the participation percentage, which reflects the dividend
rights of each class of stock. Basic earnings per share were computed using the two-class method for all periods presented. The shares of Class B stock are considered to be participating convertible securities since the shares of Class B stock are
convertible on a share-for-share basis into shares of Class A stock. Diluted earnings per share were computed assuming the conversion of the Class B shares into Class A shares as of the beginning of each period.

On May 11, 2011, we announced our Board of Directors reactivated a share repurchase program, which had no activity since fiscal 2005, to repurchase
up to the remaining available 22.5 million shares of Class A common stock under the program. The share repurchase program has no fixed or scheduled termination date. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased 9.7 million shares for
approximately $170 million under this plan. As of October 1, 2011, 12.8 million shares remain authorized for repurchase. The timing and extent to which we repurchase shares will depend upon, among other things, market conditions, liquidity
targets, limitations under our debt obligations and regulatory requirements. In addition to the share repurchase program, we purchase shares on the open market to fund certain obligations under our equity compensation plans. These repurchases
totaled $37 million and $48 million during fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Financial Instruments:

We purchase certain commodities,
such as grains and livestock in the course of normal operations. As part of our commodity risk management activities, we use derivative financial instruments, primarily futures and options, to reduce our exposure to various market risks related to
these purchases, as well as to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Contract terms of a financial instrument qualifying as a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation.
Contracts designated and highly effective at meeting risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. If a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will be offset
either against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of an
instrument’s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of cost of sales. Instruments we hold as part of our risk management activities that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are marked to fair value
with unrealized gains or losses reported currently in earnings. Changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to forward sales contracts are recorded in sales, while changes surrounding inventories on hand or
anticipated purchases of inventories or supplies are recorded in cost of sales. We generally do not hedge anticipated transactions beyond 18 months.

Revenue Recognition:

We recognize revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers, which is generally on delivery based on terms of sale. Revenue is recognized as the net amount
estimated to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts, trade allowances and product terms.



Litigation Reserves:

There are a variety of legal proceedings pending or threatened against us.
Accruals are recorded when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law, progress of each case, opinions and views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience
in similar matters and intended response to the litigation. These amounts, which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties, are adjusted periodically as assessment efforts progress or additional information becomes
available. We expense amounts for administering or litigating claims as incurred. Accruals for legal proceedings are included in Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Freight Expense:

Freight expense associated with products shipped to customers is recognized in cost of sales.

Advertising and Promotion Expenses:

Advertising and promotion expenses are charged to operations in the period incurred. Customer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a
reduction to sales based on amounts estimated as being due to customers, based primarily on historical utilization and redemption rates, while other advertising and promotional activities are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses.
Advertising and promotion expenses for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $552 million, $505 million and $491 million, respectively.

Research and Development:

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs totaled $42 million, $38 million
and $33 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Use of Estimates:

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements:

In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
clarified the guidance around fair value measurements and disclosures. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We will adopt this guidance in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. We do not
expect the adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance regarding
the presentation of comprehensive income. This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. We anticipate we will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year
2013. Upon adoption, we will be required to present comprehensive income as part of our consolidated statements of income, or in a separate financial statement. Currently, we present such information in our notes to the consolidated financial
statements. Other than changing the presentation of comprehensive income, we do not expect the adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance amending the way companies test for goodwill impairment. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with
early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2: CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance to establish accounting and reporting standards for a noncontrolling interest in a
subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This guidance clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity and may be reported as equity in the consolidated financial
statements, rather than in the liability or mezzanine section between liabilities and equity. This guidance also requires consolidated net income be reported at amounts that include the net income attributable to both Tyson (the parent) and the
noncontrolling interest. We adopted the presentation and disclosure requirements retrospectively at the beginning of fiscal 2010. Accordingly, “attributable to Tyson” refers to operating results exclusive of any noncontrolling interest. In
conjunction with this adoption, we also adopted guidance applicable for all noncontrolling interests in which we are or may be required to repurchase an interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder under a put option
or other contractual redemption requirement. Because we had certain redeemable noncontrolling interests, noncontrolling interests were presented in both the equity section and the mezzanine section of the balance sheet between liabilities and
equity.



In May 2008, the FASB issued guidance which specifies issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be
settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized
in subsequent periods. The amount allocated to the equity component represents a discount to the debt, which is amortized into interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the debt. We adopted this guidance in the first
quarter of fiscal 2010 and applied it retrospectively. Upon retrospective adoption, our effective interest rate on our 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 issued in September 2008 was determined to be 8.26%, which resulted in the recognition of
a $92 million discount to these notes with the offsetting after tax amount of $56 million recorded to capital in excess of par value. This discount is being accreted over the five-year term of the convertible notes at the effective interest rate.

The following table presents the effects of the retrospective application of new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements
(in millions, except per share data):

In December 2008, the FASB issued guidance requiring additional disclosures about assets held in an employer’s
defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the disclosure requirements in fiscal 2010. See Note 14: Pensions and
Other Postretirement Benefits for required disclosures.

In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance removing the concept of a qualifying
special-purpose entity. This guidance also clarifies the requirements for isolation and limitations on portions of financial assets eligible for sale accounting. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. We
adopted this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2011. The adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009 and December 2009, the FASB issued guidance requiring an analysis to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity.
This guidance requires an ongoing assessment and eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining whether an entity is the primary beneficiary. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2009. We adopted this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2011. The adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.



NOTE 3: ACQUISITIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATION

Acquisitions

In
August 2009, we completed the establishment of related joint ventures in China referred to as Shandong Tyson Xinchang Foods. The aggregate purchase price for our 60% equity interest was $21 million, which excludes $93 million of cash transferred to
the joint venture for future capital needs. The purchase price included $29 million allocated to Intangible Assets and $19 million allocated to Goodwill, as well as the assumption of $76 million of Current and Long-Term Debt.

In May 2011, the minority partner exercised put options requiring us to purchase its entire 40% equity interest. In August 2011, the transaction closed
for $66 million.

In October 2008, we acquired three vertically integrated poultry companies in southern Brazil: Macedo Agroindustrial,
Avicola Itaiopolis and Frangobras. The aggregate purchase price was $67 million. In addition, we had $15 million of contingent purchase price based on production volumes. The purchase price included $23 million allocated to Goodwill and $19 million
allocated to Intangible Assets. Through fiscal 2011, we have paid $11 million of the contingent purchase price.

Discontinued Operation

On March 13, 2009, we completed the sale of the beef processing, cattle feed yard and fertilizer assets of three of our Alberta,
Canada subsidiaries (collectively, Lakeside), which were part of our Beef segment, and related inventories for total consideration of $145 million, based on exchange rates then in effect. This included (a) cash received at closing of $43
million, (b) $78 million of collateralized notes receivable from either XL Foods or an affiliated entity to be collected throughout the two years following closing, and (c) $24 million of XL Foods Preferred Stock to be redeemed over five
years.

We recorded a pretax loss on sale of Lakeside of $10 million in fiscal 2009, which included an allocation of beef reporting unit
goodwill of $59 million and cumulative currency translation adjustment gains of $41 million.

The following is a summary of Lakeside’s
operating results prior to its disposition (in millions):

NOTE 4: PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Major categories of property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation at October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010:

Approximately $427 million will be required to complete buildings and equipment under construction at October 1,
2011.



NOTE 5: GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The following table reflects goodwill activity for fiscal years 2011 and 2010:

Other intangible assets by type at October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010:

Beginning with the date benefits are realized, other intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over
their estimated period of benefit of three to 30 years. Amortization expense of $18 million, $19 million and $10 million was recognized during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We estimate amortization expense on intangible assets for the
next five fiscal years subsequent to October 1, 2011 will be: 2012 - $16 million; 2013 - $16 million; 2014 - $15 million; 2015 - $15 million; 2016 - $14 million.

NOTE 6: OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES

Other current liabilities at October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, include:



NOTE 7: DEBT

The major components of debt are as follows (in millions):

Annual maturities of debt for the five fiscal years subsequent to October 1, 2011, are: 2012 - $70 million; 2013 -
$17 million; 2014 - $1,279 million; 2015 - $7 million; 2016 - $643 million.

Revolving Credit Facility

In February 2011, we amended and extended our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility that supports short-term funding needs and letters of credit. The
facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate in February 2016, provided that (a) at any time during the six-month period ending November 29, 2013, we have corporate credit ratings not lower than BBB- and Baa3 from
Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. (Moody’s), respectively, in each case with stable outlook or better, (b) on or prior to November 29, 2013, we have refinanced, purchased, or defeased
the 2014 Notes, or (c) we have irrevocably deposited cash in an amount not less than the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2014 Notes on or prior to November 29, 2013, in a blocked cash collateral account. In the event none of
the foregoing events have occurred, the loans made under this facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate on November 29, 2013. As of October 1, 2011, none of the foregoing events have occurred.

After reducing the amount available by outstanding letters of credit issued under this facility, the amount available for borrowing under this facility
at October 1, 2011, was $842 million. At October 1, 2011, we had outstanding letters of credit issued under this facility totaling $158 million, none of which were drawn upon. Our letters of credit are issued primarily in support of
workers’ compensation insurance programs, derivative activities and Dynamic Fuels’ Gulf Opportunity Zone tax-exempt bonds. We had an additional $50 million of bilateral letters of credit not issued under this facility, none of which were
drawn upon.

This facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries. The guarantors’
cash, accounts receivable, inventory and proceeds received related to these items previously secured our obligations under this facility. Because we satisfied certain credit rating requirements provided for in the facility, we requested the release
of the liens securing the facility. As of October 1, 2011, all liens securing our obligations under this facility were released, while the facility remains fully and unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries.



2013 Notes

In September 2008, we issued $458 million principal amount 3.25% convertible senior unsecured notes due October 15, 2013, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and
October 15. The conversion rate initially is 59.1935 shares of Class A stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $16.89 per share of Class A stock. The 2013 Notes may be
converted before the close of business on July 12, 2013, only under the following circumstances:

—

during any fiscal quarter after December 27, 2008, if the last reported sale price of our Class A stock for at least 20 trading days during a
period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter is at least 130% of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day (which would currently require our shares to trade at or above
$21.96); or

—

during the five business days after any 10 consecutive trading days (measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of
notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our Class A stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such day; or

—

upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as defined in the supplemental indenture.

On and after July 15, 2013, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may
convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, we will deliver cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2013 Notes to be converted and shares of our Class A stock in respect of the
remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2013 Notes being converted. As of October 1, 2011, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the 2013 Notes had been satisfied.

The 2013 Notes were originally accounted for as a combined instrument because the conversion feature did not meet the requirements to be accounted for
separately as a derivative financial instrument. However, we adopted new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and applied it retrospectively to all periods presented. This new accounting guidance required us to separately account
for the liability and equity conversion features. Upon retrospective adoption, our effective interest rate on the 2013 Notes was determined to be 8.26%, which resulted in the recognition of a $92 million discount to these notes with the offsetting
after tax amount of $56 million recorded to capital in excess of par value. This discount is being accreted over the five-year term of the convertible notes at the effective interest rate.

In connection with the issuance of the 2013 Notes, we entered into separate convertible note hedge transactions with respect to our Class A stock to minimize the potential economic dilution upon
conversion of the 2013 Notes. We also entered into separate warrant transactions. We recorded the purchase of the note hedge transactions as a reduction to capital in excess of par value, net of $36 million pertaining to the related deferred tax
asset, and we recorded the proceeds of the warrant transactions as an increase to capital in excess of par value. Subsequent changes in fair value of these instruments are not recognized in the financial statements as long as the instruments
continue to meet the criteria for equity classification.

We purchased call options in private transactions for $94 million that permit us to
acquire up to approximately 27 million shares of our Class A stock at an initial strike price of $16.89 per share, subject to adjustment. The call options allow us to acquire a number of shares of our Class A stock initially equal to
the number of shares of Class A stock issuable to the holders of the 2013 Notes upon conversion. These call options will terminate upon the maturity of the 2013 Notes.

We sold warrants in private transactions for total proceeds of $44 million. The warrants permit the purchasers to acquire up to approximately 27 million shares of our Class A stock at an initial
exercise price of $22.31 per share, subject to adjustment. The warrants are exercisable on various dates from January 2014 through March 2014.

The maximum amount of shares that may be issued to satisfy the conversion of the 2013 Notes is limited to 35.9 million shares. However, the
convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, in effect, increase the initial conversion price of the 2013 Notes from $16.89 per share to $22.31 per share, thus reducing the potential future economic dilution associated with conversion of the
2013 Notes. If our share price is below $22.31 upon conversion of the 2013 Notes, there is no economic net share impact. Upon conversion, a 10% increase in our share price above the $22.31 conversion price would result in the issuance of
2.5 million incremental shares. The 2013 Notes and the warrants could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent the price of our Class A stock during a given measurement period exceeds the respective exercise prices of
those instruments. The call options are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as their impact is anti-dilutive.

Notes

In March 2009, we issued $810 million of senior unsecured notes, which will mature in March 2014. The 2014 Notes carry a 10.50%
interest rate, with interest payments due semi-annually on March 1 and September 1. These were issued at an original issue discount of $59 million, based on an issue price of 92.756% of face value. The 2014 Notes are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries.



2016 Notes

The 2016 Notes carried an interest rate at issuance of 6.60%, with an interest step up feature dependent on their credit rating. On November 13, 2008, Moody’s downgraded the credit rating from
“Ba1” to “Ba3.” This downgrade increased the interest rate from 7.35% to 7.85%, effective beginning with the six-month interest payment due April 1, 2009.

On August 19, 2010, S&P upgraded the credit rating of these notes from “BB” to “BB+.” On September 2, 2010, Moody’s upgraded our credit rating from “Ba3”
to “Ba2.” These upgrades decreased the interest rate on the 2016 Notes from 7.85% to 7.35%, effective beginning with the six-month interest payment due October 1, 2010.

On February 24, 2011, S&P upgraded the credit rating of these notes from “BB+” to “BBB-.” On March 29, 2011, Moody’s upgraded our credit rating from “Ba2”
to “Ba1”. These upgrades decreased the interest rate on the 2016 Notes from 7.35% to 6.85%, effective beginning with the six-month interest payment due April 1, 2011.

GO Zone Tax-Exempt Bonds

In October 2008, Dynamic Fuels received $100 million in proceeds
from the sale of Gulf Opportunity Zone tax-exempt bonds made available by the federal government to the regions affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. These floating rate bonds are due October 1, 2033. In November 2008, we entered
into an interest rate swap related to these bonds to mitigate our interest rate risk on a portion of the bonds for five years. We also issued a letter of credit as a guarantee for the entire bond issuance.

Debt Covenants

Our revolving credit
facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of
or transfer assets; pay dividends or make other payments in respect of our capital stock; amend material documents; change the nature of our business; make certain payments of debt; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into
sale/leaseback or hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In addition, we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum leverage ratios.

Our 2014 Notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: incur additional debt and
issue preferred stock; make certain investments and restricted payments; create liens; create restrictions on distributions from subsidiaries; engage in specified sales of assets and subsidiary stock; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter
new lines of business; engage in consolidation, mergers and acquisitions; and engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions.

We were in
compliance with all debt covenants at October 1, 2011.

NOTE 8: INCOME TAXES

Detail of the provision for income taxes from continuing operations consists of the following:



The reasons for the difference between the statutory federal income tax rate and our effective income tax
rate from continuing operations are as follows:

During fiscal 2011, tax expense was impacted by the domestic production deduction, adjustments to reserves for uncertain
tax positions due to domestic and foreign tax audit activities, and estimated general business credits, which decreased tax expense by $25 million, $19 million, and $9 million, respectively.

During fiscal 2010, tax expense was impacted by the domestic production deduction and reductions in unrecognized tax benefits, which decreased tax expense by $24 million and $16 million, respectively.

The fiscal 2009 goodwill impairment is not deductible for income tax purposes and negatively impacted our effective income tax rate by 36.1%.
During fiscal 2009, our tax expense was impacted by an increase in foreign valuation allowance which increased tax expense by $21 million, estimated general business credits, which decreased tax expense by $12 million, and tax planning in foreign
jurisdictions which decreased tax expense by $9 million.

We recognize deferred income taxes for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

The tax effects of major items recorded as deferred tax assets and
liabilities are as follows:

We record deferred tax amounts in Other Current Assets and in Deferred Income Taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The deferred tax liability for suspended taxes from conversion to accrual method represents the 1987 change from the cash to accrual method of
accounting and will be recognized by 2027.



At October 1, 2011, our gross state tax net operating loss carryforwards approximated $635 million and
expire in fiscal years 2012 through 2029. Gross foreign net operating loss carryforwards approximated $160 million, of which $63 million expire in fiscal years 2012 through 2020, and the remainder has no expiration. We also have tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $19 million that expire in fiscal years 2012 through 2025.

We have accumulated undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $339 million and $260 million at October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, respectively. These earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. If those earnings
were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to federal income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. It is not
currently practicable to estimate the tax liability that might be payable on the repatriation of these foreign earnings.

The following table
summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits at October 1, 2011, October 2, 2010, and October 3, 2009:

The amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, that would impact our effective tax rate was $155 million and
$150 million at October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, respectively. We classify interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. At October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, before tax benefits, we had $58
million and $64 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits.

As of October 1, 2011, we are
subject to income tax examinations for U.S. federal income taxes for fiscal years 2003 through 2010. We are also subject to income tax examinations for state and foreign income taxes for fiscal years 2001 through 2010. During fiscal 2012, tax audit
resolutions could potentially reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $10 million, either because tax positions are sustained on audit or because we agree to their disallowance.

NOTE 9: OTHER INCOME AND CHARGES

During fiscal 2011, we recorded an $11 million gain related to a sale of interests in an equity method investment. This gain was
recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Other, net.

During fiscal 2010, we recognized $38 million of insurance proceeds received
related to losses incurred from Hurricane Katrina in 2005. These proceeds are reflected in the Chicken segment’s Operating Income and included in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Cost of Sales. Also in fiscal 2010, we recorded a $12
million impairment charge related to an equity method investment. This charge is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Other, net.

On March 27, 2009, we announced the decision to close our Ponca City, Oklahoma, processed meats plant. The plant ceased operation in August 2009. The closing resulted in the elimination of
approximately 600 jobs. During fiscal 2009, we recorded charges of $15 million, which included $14 million for estimated impairment charges and $1 million of employee termination benefits. The charges are reflected in the Prepared Foods
segment’s Operating Income and included in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Other Charges.



NOTE 10: EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE

The earnings and weighted average common shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are as follows:

Approximately 4 million, 5 million and 24 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of
our stock-based compensation shares were antidilutive and were not included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation.

We have two
classes of capital stock, Class A stock and Class B stock. Cash dividends cannot be paid to holders of Class B stock unless they are simultaneously paid to holders of Class A stock. The per share amount of cash dividends paid to holders of
Class B stock cannot exceed 90% of the cash dividends paid to holders of Class A stock.

We allocate undistributed earnings (losses)
based upon a 1 to 0.9 ratio per share to Class A stock and Class B stock, respectively. We allocate undistributed earnings (losses) based on this ratio due to historical dividend patterns, voting control of Class B shareholders and contractual
limitations of dividends to Class B stock.



NOTE 11: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Our business operations give rise to certain market risk exposures mostly due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency
exchange rates and interest rates. We manage a portion of these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily futures and options, to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
Forward contracts on various commodities, including grains, livestock and energy, are primarily entered into to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of these inputs used in our production processes. Foreign exchange forward
contracts are entered into to manage the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances. We also periodically utilize interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with
our variable-rate borrowings.

Our risk management programs are periodically reviewed by our Board of Directors’ Audit Committee. These
programs are monitored by senior management and may be revised as market conditions dictate. Our current risk management programs utilize industry-standard models that take into account the implicit cost of hedging. Risks associated with our market
risks and those created by derivative instruments and the fair values are strictly monitored at all times, using Value-at-Risk and stress tests. Credit risks associated with our derivative contracts are not significant as we minimize counterparty
concentrations, utilize margin accounts or letters of credit, and deal with credit-worthy counterparties. Additionally, our derivative contracts are mostly short-term in duration and we generally do not make use of credit-risk-related contingent
features. No significant concentrations of credit risk existed at October 1, 2011.

We recognize all derivative instruments as either
assets or liabilities at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales expected to result in physical delivery. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a
derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, we
designate the hedging instrument based upon the exposure being hedged (i.e., fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation). We qualify, or designate, a derivative financial instrument as a hedge when
contract terms closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. If a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the
instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings, or be recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
The ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value is recognized in earnings immediately. We designate certain forward contracts as follows:

—

Cash Flow Hedges – include certain commodity forward and option contracts of forecasted purchases (i.e., grains) and certain foreign exchange
forward contracts.

—

Fair Value Hedges – include certain commodity forward contracts of forecasted purchases (i.e., livestock).

—

Net Investment Hedges – include certain foreign currency forward contracts of permanently invested capital in certain foreign subsidiaries.

Cash flow hedges

Derivative instruments, such as futures and options, are designated as hedges against changes in the amount of future cash flows related to procurement of certain commodities utilized in our production
processes. We do not purchase forward and option commodity contracts in excess of our physical consumption requirements and generally do not hedge forecasted transactions beyond 18 months. The objective of these hedges is to reduce the variability
of cash flows associated with the forecasted purchase of those commodities. For the derivative instruments we designate and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of OCI
and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings in the current period. Ineffectiveness related to our
cash flow hedges was not significant during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009.

We had the following aggregated notionals of outstanding forward and
option contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges:

As of October 1, 2011, the net amounts expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months are
pretax losses of $21 million related to grain and pretax gains of $9 million related to foreign currency. During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, we did not reclassify significant pretax gains/losses into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of
cash flow hedges due to the probability the original forecasted transaction would not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within the additional period of time allowed by generally accepted accounting principles.



The following table sets forth the pretax impact of cash flow hedge derivative instruments on the
Consolidated Statements of Income (in millions):

Fair value hedges

We designate certain futures contracts as fair value hedges of firm commitments to purchase livestock for slaughter. Our objective of these hedges is to minimize the risk of changes in fair value created
by fluctuations in commodity prices associated with fixed price livestock firm commitments. We had the following aggregated notionals of outstanding forward contracts entered into to hedge forecasted commodity purchases which are accounted for as a
fair value hedge:

For these derivative instruments we designate and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as
well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings in the same period. We include the gain or loss on the hedged items (i.e., livestock purchase firm commitments) in the same line item,
Cost of Sales, as the offsetting gain or loss on the related livestock forward position.

Ineffectiveness related to our fair value hedges was not significant during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Foreign net investment hedges

We
utilize forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign currency, the gain or loss
is reported in OCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment to the extent it is effective, with the related amounts due to or from counterparties included in other liabilities or other assets. We utilize the forward-rate method of assessing
hedge effectiveness. Any ineffective portions of net investment hedges are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the period of change. Ineffectiveness related to our foreign net investment hedges was not significant during
fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009. At October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, we had $35 million and $49 million aggregate outstanding notionals related to our forward foreign currency contracts accounted for as foreign net investment hedges.

The following table sets forth the pretax impact of these derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Income (in millions):



Undesignated positions

In addition to our designated positions, we also hold forward and option contracts for which we do not apply hedge accounting. These include certain derivative instruments related to commodities price
risk, including grains, livestock and energy, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. We mark these positions to fair value through earnings at each reporting date. We generally do not enter into undesignated positions beyond 18 months.

The objective of our undesignated grains, energy and livestock commodity positions is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with
the forecasted purchase of certain grains, energy and livestock inputs to our production processes. We also enter into certain forward sales of boxed beef and boxed pork and forward purchases of cattle and hogs at fixed prices. The fixed price sales
contracts lock in the proceeds from a sale in the future and the fixed cattle and hog purchases lock in the cost. However, the cost of the livestock and the related boxed beef and boxed pork market prices at the time of the sale or purchase could
vary from this fixed price. As we enter into fixed forward sales of boxed beef and boxed pork and forward purchases of cattle and hogs, we also enter into the appropriate number of livestock futures positions to mitigate a portion of this risk.
Changes in market value of the open livestock futures positions are marked to market and reported in earnings at each reporting date, even though the economic impact of our fixed prices being above or below the market price is only realized at the
time of sale or purchase. These positions generally do not qualify for hedge treatment due to location basis differences between the commodity exchanges and the actual locations when we purchase the commodities.

We have a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to hedge portions of forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies, primarily with
forward and option contracts, to protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows. Our undesignated foreign currency positions generally would qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. However, to reduce earnings
volatility, we normally will not elect hedge accounting treatment when the position provides an offset to the underlying related transaction that currently impacts earnings.

The objective of our undesignated interest rate swap is to manage interest rate risk exposure on a floating-rate bond. Our interest rate swap agreement effectively modifies our exposure to interest rate
risk by converting a portion of the floating-rate bond to a fixed rate basis for the first five years, thus reducing the impact of the interest-rate changes on future interest expense. This interest rate swap does not qualify for hedge treatment due
to differences in the underlying bond and swap contract interest-rate indices.

We had the following aggregate outstanding notionals related
to our undesignated positions:

The following table sets forth the pretax impact of the undesignated derivative instruments on the Consolidated
Statements of Income (in millions):



The following table sets forth the fair value of all derivative instruments outstanding in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets (in millions):

Our derivative assets and liabilities are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets on a net basis. We net derivative
assets and liabilities, including cash collateral when a legally enforceable master netting arrangement exists between the counterparty to a derivative contract and us. See Note 12: Fair Value Measurements for a reconciliation to amounts reported in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other current assets and Other current liabilities.

NOTE 12: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy contains three levels as follows:

Level 1

— Unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.

Level 2

— Other observable inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, either directly or
indirectly, including:

—

Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;

—

Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets;

—

Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and

—

Inputs derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data.

Level 3 —

Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of significant management judgment.
These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management’s estimates of market participant assumptions.



Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into
different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the
fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The following tables set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy our financial assets and liabilities
accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis according to the valuation techniques we used to determine their fair values (in millions):

(a)

Our derivative assets and liabilities are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets on a net basis. We net derivative assets and liabilities, including cash
collateral, when a legally enforceable master netting arrangement exists between the counterparty to a derivative contract and us. At October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, we had posted $113 million and $35 million of cash collateral and
held $0 and $3 million cash collateral with various counterparties, respectively.

The following table provides a reconciliation
between the beginning and ending balance of debt securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the table above that used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):



The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial
instrument:

Derivative Assets and Liabilities:

Our derivatives, including commodities, foreign exchange forward contracts and an
interest rate swap, primarily include exchange-traded and over-the-counter contracts which are further described in Note 11: Derivative Financial Instruments. We record our commodity derivatives at fair value using quoted market prices adjusted for
credit and non-performance risk and internal models that use as their basis readily observable market inputs including current and forward commodity market prices. Our foreign exchange forward contracts are recorded at fair value based on quoted
prices and spot and forward currency prices adjusted for credit and non-performance risk. Our interest rate swap is recorded at fair value based on quoted LIBOR swap rates adjusted for credit and non-performance risk. We classify these instruments
in Level 2 when quoted market prices can be corroborated utilizing observable current and forward commodity market prices on active exchanges, observable market transactions of spot currency rates and forward currency prices or observable benchmark
market rates at commonly quoted intervals.

Available for Sale Securities:

Our investments in marketable debt securities are classified
as available-for-sale and are included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments, which are generally long-term in nature with maturities ranging up to 45 years, are reported at fair value based on pricing models and
quoted market prices adjusted for credit and non-performance risk. We classify our investments in U.S. government and agency debt securities as Level 2 as fair value is generally estimated using discounted cash flow models that are primarily
industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including time value and yield curve as well as other readily available relevant economic measures. We classify certain corporate, asset-backed and other debt securities as Level 3 as there
is limited activity or less observable inputs into proprietary valuation models, including estimated prepayment, default and recovery rates on the underlying portfolio or structured investment vehicle.

Additionally, we have eight million shares of Syntroleum Corporation common stock and 4.25 million warrants, which expire in early fiscal 2014, to
purchase an equivalent amount of Syntroleum Corporation common stock at an average price of $2.87. We record the shares and warrants in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices. We classify the
shares as Level 1 as the fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets. We classify the warrants as Level 2 as fair value can be corroborated based on observable market data.

(a)

At October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, the amortized cost basis for Corporate and Asset-Backed debt securities had been reduced by accumulated other than
temporary impairments of $3 million and $3 million, respectively.

Unrealized holding gains (losses), net of tax, are excluded
from earnings and reported in OCI until the security is settled or sold. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate whether losses related to our available-for-sale securities are temporary in nature. Losses on equity securities are recognized in earnings if
the decline in value is judged to be other than temporary. If losses related to our debt securities are determined to be other than temporary, the loss would be recognized in earnings if we intend, or more likely than not will be required, to sell
the security prior to recovery. For debt securities in which we have the intent and ability to hold until maturity, losses determined to be other than temporary would remain in OCI, other than expected credit losses which are recognized in earnings.
We consider many factors in determining whether a loss is temporary, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been below cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and our ability and intent to
hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. During fiscal 2011 and 2010, we recognized no other than temporary impairments in earnings, while we recognized $4 million of other than temporary impairments
during fiscal 2009. No other than temporary losses were deferred in OCI as of October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010.



Deferred Compensation Assets:

We maintain non-qualified deferred compensation plans for certain
executives and other highly compensated employees. Investments are maintained within a trust and include money market funds, mutual funds and life insurance policies. The cash surrender value of the life insurance policies is invested primarily in
mutual funds. The investments are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices and are included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We classify the investments which have observable market prices in active markets in Level 1
as these are generally publicly-traded mutual funds. The remaining deferred compensation assets are classified in Level 2, as fair value can be corroborated based on observable market data. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on deferred
compensation are included in earnings.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, we record assets and liabilities at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. During fiscal 2010, we recorded a $29 million charge to fully impair an immaterial Chicken segment reporting unit’s
goodwill. We utilized a discounted cash flow analysis that incorporated unobservable Level 3 inputs. We did not have any other significant measurements of assets or liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to their initial
recognition.

Other Financial Instruments

Fair values for debt are based on quoted market prices or published forward interest rate curves. Fair value and carrying value for our debt were as follows (in millions):

For all of our other financial instruments, the estimated fair value approximated the carrying value at October 1,
2011, and October 2, 2010. The carrying value of our other financial instruments, not otherwise disclosed herein, included notes receivable, which approximated fair value at October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010. Notes receivable were
recorded in Other Current Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $0 and $49 million at October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, respectively. The fair values were determined using pricing models for which the assumptions
utilize management’s estimates of market participant assumptions.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Our cash
equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas.
We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral. At October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, 16.5% and 15.3%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable balance was
due from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. No other single customer or customer group represented greater than 10% of net accounts receivable.

NOTE 13: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

We issue shares under our stock-based compensation plans by issuing Class A stock from treasury. The total number of shares
available for future grant under the Tyson Foods, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (Incentive Plan) was 15,102,409 at October 1, 2011.

Stock Options

Shareholders approved the
Incentive Plan in January 2001. The Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (Compensation Committee). The Incentive Plan includes provisions for granting incentive stock options for shares of
Class A stock at a price not less than the fair value at the date of grant. Nonqualified stock options may be granted at a price equal to, less than or more than the fair value of Class A stock on the date the option is granted. Stock
options under the Incentive Plan generally become exercisable ratably over two to five years from the date of grant and must be exercised within 10 years from the date of grant. Our policy is to recognize compensation expense on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.



We generally grant stock options once a year; however, we granted stock options twice during fiscal 2010. The weighted
average grant-date fair value of options granted in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $6.19, $4.76 and $1.29, respectively. The fair value of each option grant is established on the date of grant using a binomial lattice method. We use historical
volatility for a period of time comparable to the expected life of the option to determine volatility assumptions. Expected life is calculated based on the contractual term of each grant and takes into account the historical exercise and termination
behavior of participants. Risk-free interest rates are based on the five-year Treasury bond rate. Assumptions as of the grant date used in the fair value calculation of each year’s grants are outlined in the following table.

We recognized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, net of income taxes, of $12 million, $11 million
and $9 million, respectively, during fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, with a $7 million, $7 million and $6 million related tax benefit. We had 6.8 million, 2.2 million and 2.4 million options vest in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively, with a grant date fair value of $16 million, $13 million and $15 million, respectively.

In fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, we
received cash of $51 million, $31 million and $1 million, respectively, for the exercise of stock options. Shares are issued from treasury for stock option exercises. The related tax benefit realized from stock options exercised during fiscal years
2011, 2010 and 2009, was $10 million, $5 million and $0, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, was $26 million, $12 million and $0, respectively. Cash flows resulting from tax deductions in
excess of the compensation cost of those options (excess tax deductions) are classified as financing cash flows. We realized $5 million, $3 million and $0, respectively, in excess tax deductions during fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
As of October 1, 2011, we had $26 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option plans that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 years.

Restricted Stock

We issue restricted stock at the market value as of the date of grant,
with restrictions expiring over periods through 2014. Unearned compensation is recognized over the vesting period for the particular grant using a straight-line method.

As of October 1, 2011, we had $14 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards
that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.2 years.



We recognized stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock, net of income taxes, of $7
million, $8 million and $10 million for years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The related tax benefit for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $5 million, $5 million and $7 million, respectively. We had 0.9 million, 1.8 million and
0.7 million, respectively, restricted stock awards vest in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, with a grant date fair value of $14 million, $30 million and $11 million.

Performance-Based Shares

In July 2003, our Compensation Committee began authorizing us to
award performance-based shares of our Class A stock to certain senior executives. These awards are typically granted on the first business day of our fiscal year. The vesting of the performance-based shares is generally over three years and
each award is subject to the attainment of goals determined by the Compensation Committee prior to the date of the award. We review progress toward the attainment of goals each quarter during the vesting period. However, the attainment of goals can
be determined only at the end of the vesting period. If the shares vest, the ultimate cost will be equal to the Class A stock price on the date the shares vest multiplied by the number of shares awarded for all performance grants with other
than market criteria. For grants with market performance criteria, the ultimate expense will be the fair value of the probable shares to vest regardless if the shares actually vest. Total expense recorded related to performance-based shares was not
material for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009.

NOTE 14: PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

At October 1, 2011, we had four noncontributory defined benefit pension plans consisting of three funded qualified plans and one
unfunded non-qualified plan. All three of our qualified plans are frozen and provide benefits based on a formula using years of service and a specified benefit rate. Effective January 1, 2004, we implemented a non-qualified defined benefit plan
for certain contracted officers that uses a formula based on years of service and final average salary. We also have other postretirement benefit plans for which substantially all of our employees may receive benefits if they satisfy applicable
eligibility criteria. The postretirement healthcare plans are contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted when deemed necessary.

We have defined contribution retirement and incentive benefit programs for various groups of employees. We recognized expenses of $45 million, $48 million and $49 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.

We use a fiscal year end measurement date for our defined benefit plans and other postretirement plans. We generally recognize
the effect of actuarial gains and losses into earnings immediately for other postretirement plans rather than amortizing the effect over future periods.

Other postretirement benefits include postretirement medical costs and life insurance.

Benefit Obligations And Funded Status

The following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the plans’ benefit obligations, assets and funded status at October 1, 2011, and
October 2, 2010:



Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of:

At October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, all pension plans had an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of
plan assets. The accumulated benefit obligation for all qualified pension plans was $99 million and $97 million at October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, respectively. Plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are
as follows:

Net Periodic Benefit Cost

Components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and postretirement benefit plans recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income are as follows:

Assumptions

Weighted average assumptions are as follows:

To determine the rate-of-return on assets assumption, we first examined historical rates of return for the various asset
classes. We then determined a long-term projected rate-of-return based on expected returns over the next five to 10 years.



Our discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the
rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. These were determined using a cash flow matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, were applied to the benefit obligations
to determine the appropriate discount rate.

We have three postretirement health plans. Two of these consist of fixed, annual payments and
account for $28 million of the postretirement medical obligation at October 1, 2011. A healthcare cost trend is not required to determine this obligation. The remaining plan accounts for $16 million of the postretirement medical obligation at
October 1, 2011. The plan covers retirees who do not yet qualify for Medicare and uses a healthcare cost trend of 6% in the current year. A one-percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rate would have an immaterial impact on the
postretirement benefit obligation and total service and interest cost.

Plan Assets

The fair value of plan assets for domestic pension benefit plans was $59 million as of October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010. The following table
sets forth the actual and target asset allocation for pension plan assets:

A foreign subsidiary pension plan had $15 million in plan assets at October 1, 2011 and October 2, 2010. All of
this plan’s assets are held in an insurance contract consistent with its target asset allocation.

The Plan Trustees have established a
set of investment objectives related to the assets of the pension plans and regularly monitor the performance of the funds and portfolio managers. Objectives for the pension assets are (1) to provide growth of capital and income, (2) to
achieve a target weighted average annual rate of return competitive with other funds with similar investment objectives and (3) to diversify to reduce risk. The investment objectives and target asset allocation were adopted in January 2004 and
amended in November 2008. Alternative investments may include, but not limited to, hedge funds, private equity funds and fixed income funds.

The following table shows the categories of pension plan assets and the level under which fair values were determined in the fair value hierarchy, which
is described in Note 12: Fair Value Measurements.

(a)

Valued using quoted market prices in active markets.

(b)

Valued using plan’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets based on the best information available, such as
investment manager pricing.



A reconciliation of the change in the fair value measurement of the defined benefit plans’ consolidated
assets using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) is as follows (in millions):

We believe there are no significant concentrations of risk within our plan assets as of October 1, 2011.

Contributions

Our policy is to fund at
least the minimum contribution required to meet applicable federal employee benefit and local tax laws. In our sole discretion, we may from time to time fund additional amounts. Expected contributions to pension plans for fiscal 2012 are
approximately $7 million. For fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, we funded $7 million, $4 million and $2 million, respectively, to defined benefit plans.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

The following benefit payments are expected to be paid:

The above benefit payments for other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be offset by Medicare Part D
subsidies in 2011 or thereafter.



NOTE 15: COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)

The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows:

The components of other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows:



NOTE 16: SEGMENT REPORTING

We operate in four segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. We measure segment profit as operating income (loss).

Chicken:

Chicken operations include breeding and raising chickens, as well as processing live chickens into fresh, frozen and value-added chicken
products and logistics operations to move products through the supply chain. Products are marketed domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors, restaurant operators, hotel chains and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as
schools, healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well as to international markets. It also includes sales from allied products and our chicken breeding stock subsidiary.

Beef:

Beef operations include processing live fed cattle and fabricating dressed beef carcasses into primal and sub-primal meat cuts and
case-ready products. This segment also includes sales from allied products such as hides and variety meats, as well as logistics operations to move products through the supply chain. Products are marketed domestically to food retailers, foodservice
distributors, restaurant operators, hotel chains and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well as to international markets. Allied products are marketed to
manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and technical products.

Pork:

Pork operations include processing live market hogs and fabricating
pork carcasses into primal and sub-primal cuts and case-ready products. This segment also includes our live swine group, related allied product processing activities and logistics operations to move products through the supply chain. Products are
marketed domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors, restaurant operators, hotel chains and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well as to
international markets. We sell allied products to pharmaceutical and technical products manufacturers, as well as a limited number of live swine to pork processors.

Prepared Foods:

Prepared Foods operations include manufacturing and marketing frozen and refrigerated food products and logistics operations to move products through the supply chain. Products
include pepperoni, bacon, beef and pork pizza toppings, pizza crusts, flour and corn tortilla products, appetizers, prepared meals, ethnic foods, soups, sauces, side dishes, meat dishes and processed meats. Products are marketed domestically to food
retailers, foodservice distributors, restaurant operators, hotel chains and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well as to international markets.

The results from Dynamic Fuels are included in Other.



We allocate expenses related to corporate activities to the segments, while the related assets and additions to property,
plant and equipment remain in Other.

The Pork segment had sales of $816 million, $718 million and $449 million for fiscal 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively, from transactions with other operating segments. The Beef segment had sales of $286 million, $172 million and $155 million for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, from transactions with other operating segments.

Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for 13.3%, 13.4% and 13.8% of consolidated sales in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. were included in the Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods segments. Any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could, if not replaced, have a material impact on our operations.

The majority of our operations are domiciled in the United States. Approximately 96%, 96% and 97% of sales to external customers for fiscal 2011, 2010
and 2009, respectively, were sourced from the United States. Approximately $5.8 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively, of long-lived assets were located in the United States at October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010. Approximately $539
million and $511 million of long-lived assets were located in foreign countries, primarily Brazil, China, Mexico and India, at fiscal years ended 2011 and 2010, respectively.

We sell certain products in foreign markets, primarily Canada, Central America, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Our export sales from
the United States totaled $4.1 billion, $3.2 billion and $2.7 billion for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Substantially all of our export sales are facilitated through unaffiliated brokers, marketing associations and foreign sales staffs.
Sales of products produced in a country other than the United States were less than 10% of consolidated sales for each of fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009. Approximately $57 million of income, $11 million of loss and $14 million of loss from continuing
operations before income taxes for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, was from operations based in a country other than the United States, all of which was included in the Chicken segment.



NOTE 17: SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION

The following table summarizes cash payments for interest and income taxes:

NOTE 18: TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

We have operating leases for farms, equipment and other facilities with the estate of Don Tyson, a former director of the Company,
John Tyson, Chairman of the Company, certain members of their families and the Randal W. Tyson Testamentary Trust. Total payments of $2 million in fiscal 2011, $2 million in fiscal 2010 and $3 million in fiscal 2009, were paid to entities in which
these parties had an ownership interest.

NOTE 19: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Commitments

We lease
equipment, properties and certain farms for which total rentals approximated $183 million, $188 million and $175 million, respectively, in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009. Most leases have initial terms up to seven years, some with varying renewal
periods. The most significant obligations assumed under the terms of the leases are the upkeep of the facilities and payments of insurance and property taxes.

Minimum lease commitments under non-cancelable leases at October 1, 2011, were:

We guarantee obligations of certain outside third parties, which consists of a lease and grower loans, all of which are
substantially collateralized by the underlying assets. Terms of the underlying debt cover periods up to ten years, and the maximum potential amount of future payments as of October 1, 2011, was $76 million. We also maintain operating leases for
various types of equipment, some of which contain residual value guarantees for the market value of the underlying leased assets at the end of the term of the lease. The remaining terms of the lease maturities cover periods over the next seven
years. The maximum potential amount of the residual value guarantees is $50 million, of which $43 million would be recoverable through various recourse provisions and an additional undeterminable recoverable amount based on the fair value of the
underlying leased assets. The likelihood of material payments under these guarantees is not considered probable. At October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, no material liabilities for guarantees were recorded.

We have cash flow assistance programs in which certain livestock suppliers participate. Under these programs, we pay an amount for livestock equivalent
to a standard cost to grow such livestock during periods of low market sales prices. The amounts of such payments that are in excess of the market sales price are recorded as receivables and accrue interest. Participating suppliers are obligated to
repay these receivables balances when market sales prices exceed this standard cost, or upon termination of the agreement. Our maximum obligation associated with these programs is limited to the fair value of each participating livestock
supplier’s net tangible assets. The potential maximum obligation as of October 1, 2011, was approximately $220 million. The total receivables under these programs were $28 million and $51 million at October 1, 2011, and
October 2, 2010, respectively, and are included, net of allowance for uncollectible amounts, in Other Assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Even though these programs are limited to the net tangible assets of the participating livestock
suppliers, we also manage a portion of our credit risk associated with these programs by obtaining security interests in livestock suppliers’ assets. After analyzing residual credit risks and general market conditions, we have recorded an
allowance for these programs’ estimated uncollectible receivables of $10 million and $15 million at October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, respectively.



Additionally, we enter into future purchase commitments for various items, such as grains, livestock
contracts and fixed grower fees. At October 1, 2011, these commitments totaled:

Contingencies

We are involved in various claims and legal proceedings. We routinely assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to those matters, as well as ranges of probable losses, to the extent losses
are reasonably estimable. We record accruals for such matters to the extent that we conclude a loss is probable and the financial impact, should an adverse outcome occur, is reasonably estimable. Such accruals are reflected in the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements. In our opinion, we have made appropriate and adequate accruals for these matters and believe the probability of a material loss beyond the amounts accrued to be remote; however, the ultimate liability for these
matters is uncertain, and if accruals are not adequate, an adverse outcome could have a material effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Listed below are certain claims made against the Company and/or our
subsidiaries for which the potential exposure is considered material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe we have substantial defenses to the claims made and intend to vigorously defend these matters.

Several private lawsuits are pending against us alleging that we failed to compensate poultry plant employees for all hours worked, including overtime
compensation, in violation of the Federal Labor Standards Act (FLSA). These lawsuits include DeAsencio v. Tyson Foods, Inc. (DeAsencio), filed on August 22, 2000, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. This matter
involves similar allegations that employees should be paid for the time it takes to engage in pre- and post-shift activities such as changing into and out of protective and sanitary clothing, obtaining clothing and walking to and from the changing
area, work areas and break areas. They seek back wages, liquidated damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, and attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs appealed a jury verdict and final judgment entered in our favor on June 22, 2006, in the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. On September 7, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the jury verdict and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. We sought rehearing en
banc, which was denied by the Court of Appeals on October 5, 2007. The United States Supreme Court denied our petition for a writ of certiorari on June 9, 2008. The new trial date has not been set.

The other private lawsuits referred to above are Sheila Ackles, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. (N. Dist. Alabama, October 23, 2006); McCluster, et al.
v. Tyson Foods, Inc. (M. Dist. Georgia, December 11, 2006); Dobbins, et al. v. Tyson Chicken, Inc., et al. (N.D. Alabama, December 21, 2006); Buchanan, et al. v. Tyson Chicken, Inc., et al. and Potter, et al. v. Tyson Chicken, Inc., et al.
(N.D. Alabama, December 22, 2006); Jones, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et al., Walton, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et al. and Williams, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et al. (S.D. Mississippi, February 9, 2007); Balch, et al. v. Tyson
Foods, Inc. (E.D. Oklahoma, March 1, 2007); Adams, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. (W.D. Arkansas, March 2, 2007); Atkins, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. (M.D. Georgia, March 5, 2007); Laney, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. and Williams, et al.
v. Tyson Foods, Inc. (M.D. Georgia, May 23, 2007) (the Williams Case). Similar to DeAsencio, each of these matters involves allegations that employees should be paid for the time it takes to engage in pre- and post-shift activities such as
changing into and out of protective and sanitary clothing, obtaining clothing and walking to and from the changing area, work areas and break areas. The plaintiffs in each of these lawsuits seek or have sought to act as class representatives on
behalf of all current and former employees who were allegedly not paid for time worked and seek back wages, liquidated damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, and attorneys’ fees. On April 6, 2007, we filed a motion for transfer of the
above named actions for coordinated pretrial proceedings before the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, which was granted on August 17, 2007. These cases and five other cases subsequently filed involving the same allegations (i.e.,
Armstrong, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. (W.D. Tennessee, January 30, 2008); Maldonado, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. (E.D. Tennessee, January 31, 2008); White, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. (E.D. Texas, February 1, 2008); Meyer, et al. v.
Tyson Foods, Inc. (W.D. Missouri, February 2, 2008); and Leak, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. (W.D. North Carolina, February 6, 2008)), were transferred to the U.S. District Court in the Middle District of Georgia, In re: Tyson Foods, Inc.,
Fair Labor Standards Act Litigation (MDL Proceedings). On September 2, 2011, the parties executed a settlement agreement and filed a joint motion with the court seeking its approval of the settlement. The court approved the settlement on
September 15, 2011, and Tyson will pay at least $12.25 million but no more than $17.5 million in back pay and damages to eligible class members. The settlement agreement provides a process for identifying and certifying eligible class members,
which includes a 75-day notice period for certain class members to become eligible for payment under the settlement. In addition, the settlement agreement provides that plaintiffs’ attorneys must file an application for fees with the court but
that no more than $14.5 million in attorneys’ fees and costs will be paid. Plaintiffs’ attorneys filed their fee application on October 11, 2011.



We have pending twelve separate wage and hour actions involving Tyson Fresh Meats Inc.’s plants located
in Lexington, Nebraska (Lopez, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., D. Nebraska, June 30, 2006), Garden City and Emporia, Kansas (Garcia, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., D. Kansas, May 15, 2006), Storm Lake, Iowa (Bouaphakeo
(f/k/a Sharp), et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., N.D. Iowa, February 6, 2007), Columbus Junction, Iowa (Guyton (f/k/a Robinson), et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., d.b.a Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., S.D. Iowa, September 12, 2007), Joslin, Illinois
(Murray, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., C.D. Illinois, January 2, 2008; and DeVoss v. Tyson Foods, Inc. d.b.a. Tyson Fresh Meats, C.D. Illinois, March 2, 2011), Dakota City, Nebraska (Gomez, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., D. Nebraska,
January 16, 2008), Madison, Nebraska (Acosta, et al. v Tyson Foods, Inc. d.b.a Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., D. Nebraska, February 29, 2008), Perry and Waterloo, Iowa (Edwards, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. d.b.a Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., S.D.
Iowa, March 20, 2008); Council Bluffs, Iowa (Maxwell (f/k/a Salazar), et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. d.b.a. Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., S.D. Iowa, April 29, 2008); Logansport, Indiana (Carter, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. and Tyson Fresh Meats,
Inc., N.D. Indiana, April 29, 2008); and Goodlettsville, Tennessee (Abadeer v. Tyson Foods, Inc., and Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., M.D. Tennessee, February 6, 2009). The actions allege we failed to pay employees for all hours worked, including
overtime compensation for the time it takes to change into protective work uniforms, safety equipment and other sanitary and protective clothing worn by employees, and for walking to and from the changing area, work areas and break areas in
violation of the FLSA and analogous state laws. The plaintiffs seek back wages, liquidated damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, attorneys’ fees and costs. Each case is proceeding in its jurisdiction.

—

After a trial in the Garcia case, a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs was entered on March 17, 2011, with respect to the Garden City, Kansas facility.
Exclusive of pre- and post-judgment interest, attorneys’ fees and costs, the jury found violations of federal and state laws for pre- and post-shift work activities and awarded damages in the amount of $503,011, respectively. Plaintiffs’
counsel has filed an application for attorneys’ fees and expenses in the amount of $3,475,422. We contested the application and are currently evaluating our appeal options.

—

A jury trial was held in the Lopez case, which involved the Lexington, NE beef plant, and resulted in a jury verdict in favor of Tyson. Judgment was entered and the
complaint was dismissed with prejudice, on May 26, 2011. Plaintiffs filed an appeal with the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals on June 16, 2011.

—

A jury trial was held in the Bouaphakeo case, which involved the Storm Lake, Iowa pork plant and resulted in a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs on
September 26, 2011. Exclusive of pre- and post-judgment interest, attorneys’ fees and costs, the jury found violations of federal and state laws for pre- and post-shift work activities and awarded damages in the amount of $2,892,379. On
October 24, 2011, we renewed our motion for judgment as a matter of law due to a failure of class-wide proof and, in the alternative, for a new trial on damages.

—

The Guyton, Gomez and Acosta cases are scheduled for trials on April 9, 2012, October 15, 2012, and November 13, 2012, respectively.

We have pending one wage and hour action involving our Tyson Prepared Foods plant located in Jefferson, Wisconsin (Weissman, et
al. v. Tyson Prepared Foods, Inc., Jefferson County (Wisconsin) Circuit Court, October 20, 2010). The plaintiffs allege that employees should be paid for the time it takes to engage in pre- and post-shift activities such as changing into and
out of protective and sanitary clothing and the associated time it takes to walk to and from their workstations post-donning and pre-doffing of protective and sanitary clothing. Six named plaintiffs seek to act as state law class
representatives on behalf of all current and former employees who were allegedly not paid for time worked and seek back wages, liquidated damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, and attorneys’ fees and costs. On May 16, 2011, Plaintiffs
filed a motion to certify a state law class of all hourly employees who have worked at the Jefferson plant from October 20, 2008, to the present. We have filed motions for summary judgment seeking dismissal of the claims, or, in the
alternative, to limit the claims made for non-compensable clothes changing activities.

On June 19, 2005, the Attorney General and the
Secretary of the Environment of the State of Oklahoma filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma against us, three of our subsidiaries and six other poultry integrators. This complaint was subsequently
amended. As amended, the complaint asserts a number of state and federal causes of action including, but not limited to, counts under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act (RCRA), and state-law public nuisance theories. The amended complaint asserts that defendants and certain contract growers who are not named in the amended complaint polluted the surface waters, groundwater and associated drinking water supplies
of the Illinois River Watershed (IRW) through the land application of poultry litter. Oklahoma asserts that this alleged pollution has also caused extensive injury to the environment (including soils and sediments) of the IRW and that the defendants
have been unjustly enriched. Oklahoma’s claims cover the entire IRW, which encompasses more than one million acres of land and the natural resources (including lakes and waterways) contained therein. Oklahoma seeks wide-ranging relief,
including injunctive relief, compensatory damages in excess of $800 million, an unspecified amount in punitive damages and attorneys’ fees.



We and the other defendants have denied liability, asserted various defenses, and filed a third-party
complaint that asserts claims against other persons and entities whose activities may have contributed to the pollution alleged in the amended complaint. The district court has stayed proceedings on the third party complaint pending resolution of
Oklahoma’s claims against the defendants. On October 31, 2008, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to join the Cherokee Nation as a required party or, in the alternative, for judgment as a matter of law based on the
plaintiffs’ lack of standing. This motion was granted in part and denied in part on July 22, 2009. In its ruling, the district court dismissed Oklahoma’s claims for cost recovery and for natural resources damages under CERCLA and for
unjust enrichment under Oklahoma common law. This ruling also narrowed the scope of Oklahoma’s remaining claims by dismissing all damage claims under its causes of action for Oklahoma common law nuisance, federal common law nuisance, and
Oklahoma common law trespass, leaving only its claims for injunctive relief for trial. On August 18, 2009, the Court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Oklahoma’s claims for violations of the Oklahoma Registered
Poultry Feeding Operations Act. Oklahoma later voluntarily dismissed the remainder of this claim. On September 2, 2009, the Cherokee Nation filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit. Its motion to intervene was denied on September 15,
2009, and the Cherokee Nation filed a notice of appeal of that ruling in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals on September 17, 2009. A non-jury trial of the case began on September 24, 2009. At the close of Oklahoma’s case-in-chief, the
Court granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss claims based on RCRA, nuisance per se, and health risks related to bacteria. The defense rested its case on January 13, 2010, and closing arguments were held on February 11, 2010. On
September 21, 2010, the Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s denial of the Cherokee Nation’s motion to intervene. On October 6, 2010 the Cherokee Nation and the State of Oklahoma filed a petition for rehearing or

en
banc

review seeking reconsideration of this ruling. The Court of Appeals denied this petition.

On May 8, 2008, a lawsuit was filed
against the Company and two of our employees in the District Court of McCurtain County, Oklahoma styled Armstrong, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et al. (the Armstrong Case). The lawsuit was brought by a group of 52 poultry growers who allege that
certain of our live production practices in Oklahoma constitute fraudulent inducement, fraud, unjust enrichment, negligence, gross negligence, unconscionability, violations of the Oklahoma Business Sales Act, Deceptive Trade Practice violations,
violations of the Consumer Protection Act, and conversion, as well as other theories of recovery. The plaintiffs sought damages in an unspecified amount. On October 30, 2009, 20 additional growers represented by the same attorney filed a
lawsuit against us in the same court asserting the same or similar claims, which is styled Clardy, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et al. (the Clardy Case). In both of these cases we have denied all allegations of wrongdoing. In June 2009, the
plaintiffs in the Armstrong case requested an expedited trial date for a smaller group of plaintiffs they claimed were facing imminent financial peril. The Court ultimately severed a group of 10 plaintiffs from the Armstrong Case, and a trial began
on March 15, 2010. There were numerous irregularities and rulings during the trial which we believe to have been legally erroneous and highly prejudicial to our right to a fair trial. On April 1, 2010, the jury returned a verdict against
us and one of our employees, and on April 2, 2010, the jury returned a punitive damages verdict against us. After a dispute caused by inconsistencies between the multiple verdict forms completed by the jury and apparent confusion by the jury as
to how to complete those verdict forms, the Court entered a final judgment in the amount of $8,655,735. Subsequent to the trial, the presiding judge disqualified from the cases and the Oklahoma Supreme Court appointed a new judge to the cases. The
Company filed post-trial motions challenging the verdict. Those motions were denied. The Company has appealed the verdict to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. We filed a motion with the trial court to change venue from McCurtain County on the grounds that
the numerous irregularities that occurred during the trial, coupled with the attendant publicity, resulted in community bias which would prevent the Company from receiving a fair trial in McCurtain County. The trial court granted this motion and the
case will be transferred to Choctaw County, Oklahoma. We filed another motion, which the trial court also granted, to stay all future trials of the claims of the plaintiffs in the Armstrong Case and the Clardy Case pending the outcome of the appeal
of the first trial. We also filed a motion to sever all of the plaintiffs’ claims into individual cases, which was heard on January 25, 2010. This motion was denied, but the Court took under advisement the sizes and groupings of plaintiffs
in future trials. We believe numerous and substantial legal errors were made by the Court during the trial and that a review of and guidance on these issues by the appellate court could have a substantial impact on the outcome of future trials in
the Armstrong Case and the Clardy Case.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Tyson Foods, Inc.

In our
opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of October 1, 2011 and October 2, 2010 and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the fiscal years then ended present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Tyson Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries at October 1, 2011 and October 2, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended
October 1, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules for the fiscal years ended October 1, 2011 and October 2, 2010
listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the
financial statement schedules, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures

An evaluation was performed, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including
the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the 1934 Act)). Based on that evaluation, management, including the CEO and CFO, has concluded that, as of October 1, 2011, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In the quarter ended October 1,
2011, there have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control
over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2011. In making this
assessment, we used criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

.

Based on this evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by COSO, Management concluded the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of October 1, 2011.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, who has
audited the fiscal 2011 financial statements included in this Form 10-K has also audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Their report appears in Part II, Item 8.
