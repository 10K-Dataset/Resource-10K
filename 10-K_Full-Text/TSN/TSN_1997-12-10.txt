ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

General

      Tyson  Foods,  Inc.  and its various subsidiaries (collectively,  the
"Company")  produce,  market  and distribute a  variety  of  food  products
consisting  of  value-enhanced poultry; fresh and  frozen  poultry;  value-
enhanced  seafood products; fresh and frozen seafood products and  prepared
foods  and  other  products  such as flour and corn  tortillas  and  chips.
Additionally,  the  Company  has  live swine,  animal  feed  and  pet  food
ingredients  operations.  The Company's integrated  operations  consist  of
breeding  and  rearing  chickens,  harvesting  seafood,  as  well  as   the
processing,  further-processing and marketing of these food  products.  The
Company's  products are marketed and sold to national and regional  grocery
chains,  regional grocery wholesalers, clubs and warehouse stores, military
commissaries, industrial food processing companies, national  and  regional
chain restaurants or their distributors, international export companies and
domestic distributors who service restaurants, foodservice operations  such
as  plant  and school cafeterias, convenience stores, hospitals  and  other
vendors.  Sales  are  made  by  the  Company's  sales  staffs  located   in
Springdale,  Arkansas,  in  regions throughout the  United  States  and  in
several  foreign  countries. Additionally, sales  to  the  military  and  a
portion  of  sales  to  international markets are made through  independent
brokers  and trading companies. The Company conducts the major  portion  of
its  business activities on a vertically integrated basis and considers its
business  to be one industry segment, that of "food products." The  Company
commenced business in 1935, was incorporated in Arkansas in 1947,  and  was
reincorporated in Delaware in 1986.

Description

      Originally,  the  Company  was a producer and  distributor  of  fresh
chicken.  The  Company developed a strategy to reduce  the  impact  of  the
commodity  market  of the fresh chicken business through value-enhancement.
As  the  industry  leader in value-enhanced poultry products,  the  Company
utilizes  national and regional advertising, special promotions  and  brand
identification,  and  meets the varying demands of  its  customers  through
capital  expenditures  and strategic acquisitions.  With  further-processed
poultry  products, grain costs as a percentage of total product  costs  are
reduced  because  of the value added to the products by cutting,  deboning,
cooking, packaging or freezing the poultry.

      The  Company's integrated poultry processes include genetic research,
breeding,   hatching,  rearing,  ingredient  procurement,   feed   milling,
veterinary  and  other technical services, and related  transportation  and
delivery  services.  The  Company contracts  with  independent  growers  to
maintain the Company's flocks of breeder chicks which, when grown, lay  the
eggs  which the Company transfers to its hatcheries and hatch into  broiler
chicks.  Newly hatched broiler chicks are vaccinated and are then delivered
to  independent  contract growers who care for and feed the broiler  chicks
until  they reach processing weight, usually from the end of the fourth  to
the  eighth  week. During the broiler growout period, the Company  provides
growers with feed, vitamins and medication for the broilers, if needed,  as
well   as  supervisory  and  technical  services.  The  broilers  are  then
transported  by  the Company to its nearby processing plants.  The  Company
processed  approximately  5.6 billion pounds  of  consumer  poultry  during
fiscal 1997.

     The Company's farrow to finish swine operations, which include genetic
and  nutritional research, breeding, farrowing and feeder pig finishing and
the marketing of live swine to regional and national packers, are conducted
in  Arkansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Missouri and Alabama.  The  Company
sold  approximately 1.8 million head of market weight live swine in  fiscal
1997.

     The  Company is the leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor  of
branded  surimi-based seafood offerings including analog crabmeat, lobster,
shrimp and scallops. Additionally, the Company's seafood operations consist
of  one  of the largest catching and at-sea processing fleets in the  North
Pacific.  These  vessels harvest a wide range of species of bottomfish  and
shellfish  year-round off the coasts of Alaska, Washington and Oregon.  The
catch  is  either processed at sea or in shore-based processing  facilities
into  a  variety  of  product forms. The Company's long-term  strategy  for
seafood  products  continues  to  be a plan  of  using  its  marketing  and
distribution  channels  to  expand  sales  opportunities  while  using  its
research  and  development  resources to create  additional  value-enhanced
seafood products.

     The  Company's  Mexican  Original operations produce  flour  and  corn
tortilla products for Mexican restaurants and other major customers.

     Mallard's Food Products, Inc., which was acquired in August 1997,  and
Culinary  Foods,  Inc.,  produce specialty pasta  and  meat  dishes.  These
products are included in the other prepared foods category.

     The  Company's  by-products operations convert  inedible  poultry  by-
products into high-grade pet food and animal feed ingredients.

Sources of Revenue

      The  principal  revenue sources of the Company include value-enhanced
poultry  products,  fresh  and frozen poultry  products,  Mexican  Original
products,  frozen dinner products, seafood products, live swine operations,
animal  foods,  by-products, and other products. In the  first  quarter  of
1997,  the  Company sold the beef further-processing plants and closed  the
pork  further-processing plant. Revenue for 1996 and  1995  include  value-
enhanced  beef  and  pork  products. The following  table  sets  forth  the
relative sources of the Company's revenues for the last three fiscal years.

certain  processes  are  added  to enhance their  value  to  the  Company's
customers.

(2)   Includes  fresh  and  frozen  poultry  products  sold  without  value
enhancements.  The  increase  in  this category  for  fiscal  1996  results
from   the   acquisition   of  the  U.S.  broiler  business   of   Cargill,
Incorporated and McCarty Farms, Inc., in September 1995.

(3)   Previously  included value-enhanced beef and pork  products  such  as
portion   controlled  steaks,  chops  and  roasts,  ground  beef,  chicken-
fried  steaks,  meatloaf,  hams, bacon and sausages.  These  products  have
been  discontinued due to the sale of the Company's beef further-processing
facilities  and closure of the Company's pork further-processing operations
in the first quarter of fiscal 1997.

(4)   Includes flour and corn tortillas, corn chips, taco shells and filled
tortilla specialty items; premium frozen dinners and other specialty items.

(5)  Includes  surimi-based  products  as  well  as  breaded  and  battered
seafood, fillets and crab.


Marketing and Distribution

      The  Company seeks to develop and increase the demand for and  market
share  of a product or product line through concentrated national and local
advertising  and other promotional efforts, stressing product  quality  and
brand  identification  and  meeting  specific  customer  requirements.  The
Company's  principal marketing strategy is to identify target  markets  for
value-enhanced  food  products  consisting primarily  of  poultry,  Mexican
Original  and  seafood.  The  Company concentrates  production,  sales  and
marketing  efforts in order to appeal to and enhance the demand from  those
markets. The Company utilizes its national distribution system and customer
support services to achieve a dominant market position for its products and
identifies distinct markets through trade and consumer research.

      The  Company's nationwide distribution system utilizes a  network  of
food  distributors which is supported by cold storage warehouses  owned  or
leased  by  the  Company,  by public cold storage  facilities  and  by  the
Company's  transportation  system. The  Company  ships  products  from  two
Company-owned  major  frozen food distribution  centers  having  a  storage
capacity of approximately 58 million pounds, from a network of public  cold
storages,  from other owned or leased facilities or directly  from  plants.
The  Company  has a total frozen storage capacity in excess of 118  million
pounds,   excluding   public  or  outside  cold  storage.   The   Company's
distribution centers facilitate accumulating frozen products so that it can
fill  and  consolidate  less-than-truckload orders  into  full  truckloads,
thereby  decreasing  shipping costs while increasing customer  service.  In
addition, customers are provided with a selection of products that  do  not
require  large volume orders. The Company's distribution system enables  it
to   supply  large  or  small  quantities  of  products  to  meet  customer
requirements anywhere in the continental United States.




     The Company's food products are sold primarily in three broad domestic
markets  consisting  of  foodservice,  retail  and  wholesale  clubs.   The
foodservice, retail and wholesale club markets may, in some cases, overlap.
The Company's food products are also sold internationally.

      In  the  foodservice market, the Company sells poultry,  seafood  and
tortilla  products.  Operators serving these  products  include  commercial
restaurants,  business/industry,  colleges/universities,  national/regional
chains, hotels/lodging, primary/secondary schools, health/elderly care  and
other  foodservice  accounts.  The  Company's  products  are  sold  through
foodservice  and  specialty distributors who deliver to  the  above  listed
operators.

       Foodservice  products  are  sold  under  the  following  brands  and
registered  trademarks: Tyson, Holly Farms, Weaver, Tastybird  Tastybasted,
Honey   Stung,  Tyson's  Pride,  HoneyBest,  Wing  Stingers,  W.W.  Flyers,
Signature  Specialties,  Flavor-Redi,  Lady  Aster,  Quality  Cuisine,  Our

several species of flatfish.

     In the retail market the Company sells a wide variety of food products
to  customers  that  sell  food products for  at-home  consumption.   These
customers  include  grocery store chains, independent  grocery  stores  and
grocery wholesalers.

      Tyson, Weaver, Tyson Holly Farms, Mexican Original, Louis Kemp,  Crab
Delights,  Lobster Delights, JAC Creative Foods, Captain JAC,  SeaFest  and
Mallard's  are registered trademarks under which the Company  sells  retail
products.

      Retail  products  include: (a) frozen prepared  foods  consisting  of
separate  lines  of  Tyson  breaded chicken patties,  chunks,  fillets  and
tenders;  Weaver  breaded chicken tenders, nuggets,  patties  and  fillets;
Tyson  premium  plated  dinners; Tyson and Weaver flavored  chicken  wings;

game hens; and (e) seafood products which are marketed under the Louis Kemp
brand  of  Crab Delights and Lobster Delights, as well as the JAC  Creative
Foods brands of Captain JAC and SeaFest.




     In the wholesale club market the Company designs and markets a variety
of  products  targeted  to small foodservice operators  and  consumers  who
frequent  club  stores.  These  products  are  aimed  at  both  foodservice
operators who buy in small quantities and want to cut costs of storage  and
final distribution, as well as retail consumers willing to buy larger  than
normal  quantities  to  realize cost savings.  The  Company  sells  several
categories  of products including: IQF chicken, fresh chicken, refrigerated
roasted  ready-to-eat  chicken,  frozen  value-added  chicken  and   canned
chicken; surimi-based seafood products, frozen pollock, cod and crab legs.

      The Company's international division markets and sells throughout the
world  the full line of Tyson products, including poultry, Mexican Original
products  and seafood. The international division exported to 61  countries
in  fiscal  1997.  Major  markets include Russia, Japan,  China/Hong  Kong,
Puerto  Rico, Singapore, South Africa and Mexico. The Company also exported
to  Canada,  certain  Middle Eastern countries and many  countries  in  the
Caribbean.

     The Company continues to believe that Southeast Asia offers tremendous
potential  in terms of developing fully-integrated poultry facilities.    A
memorandum of understanding has been signed with the Kuok Group to  develop
up to ten poultry production and processing complexes in China. The Company
has also established a joint venture called Fil-Am Foods, Inc. with Aboitiz
Equity  Ventures,  Inc.  and PM Nutrition Company, Inc.,  a  subsidiary  of
Purina Mills, Inc., to create a commercial feed and swine operation in  the
Philippines. Meanwhile, the Company's joint venture operation in Mexico has
grown  under  economically  difficult conditions.   The  Company  has  also
entered  into a distribution agreement for the sale of products  in  Russia
and  opened an office in Moscow allowing the Company to develop more direct
contact   with   its  customers.   Cobb-Vantress,  Inc.,   a   wholly-owned
subsidiary,  has entered into a joint venture agreement with  a  Hong  Kong
company to build a 180 thousand capacity breeder farm in China. The Company
also  has a seafood processing joint venture in Shanghai, China. This joint
venture is engaged in the value-added processing of seafood items.

      In  1995, the Company's International Division created a wholly-owned
subsidiary called "World Resource, Inc."  This subsidiary acts as a trading
company which handles the acquisition, certification and transportation  of
primarily agricultural goods worldwide.

Raw Materials and Sources of Supply

      The  primary  raw  materials  used by  the  Company  in  its  poultry
operations  consists  of  feed ingredients, cooking ingredients,  packaging
materials  and cryogenic agents. The Company believes that its  sources  of
supply  for  these  materials are adequate for its present  needs  and  the
Company does not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials  in
the  future. While the Company produces substantially all of its  inventory
of  breeder  chickens and live broilers, it has the capability to  purchase
live,   ice-packed   or   deboned  poultry  to  meet   poultry   production
requirements.

      In  addition,  raw  material requirements for the  Company's  seafood
operations  are  met  by either purchasing in the open  market  or  by  the
Company's  vessels  harvesting a wide range of species  of  bottomfish  and
shellfish off the coasts of Alaska, Washington and Oregon.   A large supply
                                     
                                     

of  bottomfish,  one  of the principal groups of fish harvested  for  human
consumption, is found in the 200-mile U.S. exclusive economic zone off  the
coast of Alaska. This area also provides a significant quantity of crab for
commercial  harvesting; however, crab quotas have been severely limited  in
recent  years.  Following passage of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation  and
Management  Act  of 1976 (the "Magnuson Act"), the United  States  extended
control over the management of offshore fishing resources from a 12-mile to
a  200-mile  exclusive  economic zone by, among other things,  establishing
annual catch limits and allocating the available resources between U.S. and
foreign  catchers and processors. As a result of these government  actions,
the Company's ability to harvest seafood is subject to these limitations.

Patents and Trademarks

      The  Company  has registered a number of trademarks relating  to  its
products  which  either  have  been approved  or  are  in  the  process  of
application.  Because the Company does a significant amount of  brand  name
and  product  line  advertising to promote its products, it  considers  the
protection of such trademarks to be important to its marketing efforts. The
Company has also developed non-public proprietary information regarding its
production  processes  and  other  product-related  matters.  The   Company
utilizes  internal procedures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality
of such information, and where appropriate, seeks patent protection for the
technology it utilizes.

Seasonal Demand

      The demand for the Company's products generally increases during  the
spring  and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months.
Because  of the somewhat seasonal character of the Company's business,  the
Company  may  increase its finished product inventories during  the  winter
months in anticipation of increased spring and summer demands.

Industry Practices

      The Company's agreements with its customers are generally short-term,
verbal  agreements  due primarily to the nature of its  products,  industry
practice and the fluctuation in demand and price for such products.

Customer Relations

      No  single customer of the Company accounts for more than ten percent
of the Company's consolidated revenues, and the loss of any single customer
would  not  have  a  material  adverse effect on  the  Company's  business.
Although any extended discontinuance of sales to any major customer  could,
if  not  replaced, have an impact on the Company's operations, the  Company
does not anticipate any such occurrences due to the demand for its products
and its ability to obtain new customers.

Backlog of Orders

     There is no significant backlog of unfilled orders for the Company's
products.

      The Company's food products compete with those of other national  and
regional   food   producers  and  processors  and  certain  prepared   food
manufacturers.  Additionally,  the  Company's  food  products  compete   in
international markets in Europe, South America, Central America and the Far
East.  The  Company's principal marketing and competitive  strategy  is  to
identify   target  markets  for  value-enhanced  products,  to  concentrate
production,  sales and marketing efforts in order to appeal to and  enhance
the  demand  from  those  markets and, utilizing its national  distribution
system and customer support services, to achieve a dominant market position
for  its  products.  Past  efforts  have  indicated  that  customer  demand
generally  can  be  increased  and sustained  through  application  of  the
Company's marketing strategy, as supported by its distribution system.

Research and Development

     The Company conducts continuous research and development activities to
improve  the  strains  of  primary  poultry  breeding  stock,  the  genetic
qualities  of  swine,  and  finished product development.  Additionally,  a
separate  staff  of  research and development personnel  is  maintained  to
develop and provide for product needs. The annual cost of such research and
development programs is less than one percent of total consolidated  annual
sales.

Regulation

      The  Company's facilities for processing poultry and for housing live
poultry and swine are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws
relating  to  the  protection  of  the  environment,  including  provisions
relating  to the discharge of materials into the environment,  and  to  the
health  and  safety  of its employees. The Company's  poultry  and  Mexican
Original  processing  and  distribution  facilities  are  also  subject  to
extensive  inspection  and regulation by the United  States  Department  of
Agriculture. The cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has  not
had  a  material  adverse effect upon the Company's  capital  expenditures,
earnings  or  competitive  position and it is not  anticipated  to  have  a
material adverse effect in the future.

      Fishing activities and seafood processing activities of the Company's
seafood operations are closely regulated by the United States Department of
Commerce  and  various  other  state  and  governmental  agencies.    These
agencies,  among  other  things, establish  fishing  seasons  and  resource
depletion  restrictions and regulate legal gear types.  Violations  of  the
Magnuson  Act  and state laws can result in substantial penalties,  ranging
from  fines  to  seizure  of catch and vessels. In  addition,  the  seafood
operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to
the  protection  of  the  environment and the  health  and  safety  of  its
employees.

      To  provide consumer reassurance of product integrity and safety,  to
create a quality point of difference from the competition, and to assume  a
position  of  measured  industry leadership in  production  standards,  the
Company's seafood operation voluntarily complies with certain United States
Department  of  Commerce regulations which enable it  to  show  the  United
States  Department  of  Commerce seal of approval  (PUFI)  on  its  primary
products.  Three of the  Company's  seafood  manufacturing  facilities  are


United States Department of Commerce inspected and are participants in  the
government's pilot Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) program.

Employees and Labor Relations

      As  of  September 27, 1997, the Company employed approximately 59,400

material impact on operations.

(1)   Prior  to August 31, 1997, an election was held in which the  Chicago
Truck Drivers Union was elected to represent the employees of the Company's
Chicago,  Illinois  facility. The UFCW has protested the  results  of  that
election  to  the  National  Labor Relations Board  ("NLRB").  The  Company
anticipates that, upon a final determination of the matter by the NLRB, the
Company  will enter into a new collective bargaining agreement with  either
the UFCW or the Chicago Truck Drivers Union.

      The  principal  poultry  operations of  the  Company  consist  of  55
processing  plants.  These  plants  are  devoted  to  various   phases   of
slaughtering, dressing, cutting, packaging, deboning or further-processing.
The total slaughter capacity is approximately 37 million head per week.

     To support the above facilities the Company operates 31 feed mills and
58  broiler  hatcheries with sufficient capacity to meet the needs  of  the
poultry  growout  operations.  In addition, the Company owns  poultry  cold
storage facilities with a capacity of approximately 112.3 million pounds.

      The Company's Mexican Original products and prepared foods operations
consist  of eight processing plants, including two Mallard's Food Products,
Inc.,  facilities located in Modesto, California acquired in  August  1997.
These   operations  are  supported  by  five  additional  freezer   storage
facilities.

      The  Company's seafood operations consist of 27 catching  and  at-sea
processing  vessels  along with two freighters. The  at-sea  processing  is
supported  by  nine  shore-based  processing  plants,  five  of  which  are
dedicated to surimi processing.

      The  Company's animal feed and pet food processing operations consist
of  seven rendering plants with the capacity to produce 19.5 million pounds
of  animal protein products per week supported by three freezer facilities.
Thirteen  ground pet food processing operations in connection with  poultry
processing  plants are capable of producing 7.4 million pounds  of  product
per week.


     The Company's live swine operations consist of 158 swine farrowing and
nursery units and 389 swine finishing units. These swine growout operations
are  supported by three dedicated feed mills supplemented by the production
from  the poultry operations' feed mills. In addition, the Company operates
a grain drying and two storage facilities in support of its swine feed mill
operations.

      The Company owns its major operating facilities and vessels with  the
following  exceptions:  one poultry processing plant  is  leased  under  an
agreement  expiring  in 2002 and one poultry emulsified operation  facility
and  one  poultry emulsified plant are leased month to month,  283  breeder
farms  are leased under agreements expiring at various dates through  1999,

64  swine  farrowing  and nursery units and 318 swine finishing  units  are
leased  under  one to ten year renewable lease agreements and  two  seafood
processing plants are leased under agreements expiring in 1998 and 2001.

       Management  believes  that  the  Company's  present  facilities  are
generally  adequate and suitable for its current purposes. In general,  the
Company's facilities are fully utilized. However, seasonal fluctuations  in
inventories  and production may occur as a reaction to market  demands  for
certain products.  The Company regularly engages in construction and  other
capital  improvement projects intended to expand capacity and  improve  the
efficiency of its processing and support facilities.

charges  have been filed against the Company related to this investigation.
The  Company  and its legal counsel are unable to estimate  the  amount  or
likelihood  of  potential  loss, if any, that may  result  from  the  OIC's
investigation or any subsequent proceedings.

prices,  as well as credit risk concentrations. To address these risks  the
Company  enters into various hedging transactions as described  below.  The
Company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes and is  not
a party to any leveraged derivatives.

Foreign Currency and Interest Rate Risks

       The  Company  periodically  enters  into  foreign  exchange  forward
contracts  and  option  contracts to hedge some  of  its  foreign  currency
exposure.  The Company uses such contracts to hedge exposure to changes  in
foreign currency

foreign  currency exchange  rates, primarily  Japanese yen, associated with
sales denominated in  foreign currency. Gains and losses on these contracts
are deferred and recognized  as an adjustment of the subsequent transaction
when it  occurs. Forward and option contracts generally have maturities not
exceeding twelve months.

      The  Company  also  hedges exposure to changes in interest  rates  on
certain of its financial instruments.  Under the terms of various leveraged
equipment  loans, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements  to
effectively  lock  in  a  fixed interest rate  for  these  borrowings.  The
maturity dates of these leveraged equipment loans range from 2005  to  2008
with interest rates ranging from 4.9% to 6.0%.

      As  of  September  27, 1997 and September 28,  1996,  the  stated  or
notional amounts of the Company's outstanding foreign currency and interest
rate derivative financial instruments were as follows:

Foreign forward exchange contracts                            0.5
==================================================================

Credit Risks

     The Company's financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables.
The  Company's cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed  with
major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk  with
respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and
their  dispersion  across geographic areas. The Company  performs  periodic
credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally does
not  require  collateral.  One  customer located  in  Russia  accounts  for
approximately  11% of total accounts receivable. No other single  group  or
customer represents greater than 10% of total accounts receivable.

The  following  table  provides information about the Company's  derivative
financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to
changes  in  interest  rates. The table presents  for  the  Company's  debt
obligations,  principal  cash flows and related  weighted-average  interest
rates  by  expected  maturity dates. For interest  rate  swaps,  the  table
presents  notional amounts and weighted-average interest  rates  or  strike
rates by contractual maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate
the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract.

Commodities Risk

      The Company is a purchaser of certain commodities, primarily corn and
soybeans.   The  Company uses commodity futures and purchased  options  for
hedging  purposes to reduce the effect of changing commodity  prices  on  a
portion  of  its commodity purchases.  The contracts that effectively  meet
risk   reductions  and  correlation  criteria  are  recorded  using   hedge
accounting.   Gains  and losses on hedge transactions  are  recorded  as  a
component of the underlying inventory purchase.

The  following table provides information about the Company's corn, soybean
meal  and  other feed ingredient inventory and futures contracts  that  are
sensitive to changes in commodity prices. For inventory, the table presents
the  carrying amount and fair value at September 27, 1997. For the  futures
contracts the table presents the notional amounts in bushels, the  weighted
average  contract prices, and the total dollar contract amount by  expected
maturity  dates,  the latest of which occurs one year  from  the  reporting
date.  Contract amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments  and
quantity  of  corn  and  soybean meal to be  exchanged  under  the  futures
contracts.
