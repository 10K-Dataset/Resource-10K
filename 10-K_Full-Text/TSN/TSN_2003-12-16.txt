ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

Tyson Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively,
"the Company" or "Tyson"), with world headquarters in Springdale,
Arkansas, produce, distribute and market chicken, beef, pork, prepared foods
and related allied products.  The Company commenced business in 1935, was
incorporated in Arkansas in 1947, and was reincorporated in Delaware in 1986.  The
Company has engaged in a number of acquisitions, including the acquisitions of
IBP, inc. (IBP) in 2001, Hudson Foods, Inc. in 1998 and Holly Farms Corporation
in 1989.  In addition to being the world's largest processor and marketer of
chicken, beef and pork products, the Company is also the second largest publicly
traded food company in the United States and has one of the most recognized
brand names in the food industry.

The Company
is a totally integrated poultry company.  Through its wholly owned subsidiary,
Cobb-Vantress, Tyson is the number one breeding stock supplier in the world.  Tyson
invests in breeding stock research and development which allows the Company to
breed into its flocks the natural characteristics found to be most desirable.  The
Company's integrated operations consist of breeding and raising chickens, as
well as the processing, further-processing and marketing of these food products
and related allied products, including animal and pet food ingredients.

The Company
is also involved in the processing of live fed cattle and hogs and fabrication
of dressed beef and pork carcasses into primal and sub-primal meat cuts,
case-ready products and fully-cooked beef and pork products.  In addition, the
Company derives value from allied products such as hides and variety meats for
sale to further processors.

The Company
produces a wide range of fresh, value-added, frozen and refrigerated food
products.  The Company's products are marketed and sold to national and
regional grocery chains, regional grocery wholesalers, meat distributors, clubs
and warehouse stores, military commissaries, industrial food processing
companies, national and regional chain restaurants or their distributors,
international export companies and domestic distributors who service
restaurants, foodservice operations such as plant and school cafeterias,
convenience stores, hospitals and other vendors.  Sales are made by the
Company's sales staff located in Springdale, Arkansas, and Dakota Dunes, South
Dakota, as well as in various regional offices throughout the United States and
in several foreign countries.  Additionally, sales to the military and a
portion of sales to international markets are made through independent brokers
and trading companies.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS

The Company operates in five business segments:
Chicken, Beef, Pork, Prepared Foods and Other.  The contribution of each
business segment to net sales and operating income, and the identifiable assets
attributable to each business segment are set forth in Note 17, "Segment
Reporting" of the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein at pages 51
through 52.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Chicken

The Company's chicken operations are primarily involved in the processing of
live chickens into fresh, frozen and value-added chicken products sold through
domestic foodservice, domestic food retailers, wholesale club markets that
service small foodservice operations, small businesses and individuals, as well
as specialty and commodity distributors who deliver to restaurants, schools and
international markets throughout the world.  The Chicken segment also includes
sales from allied products and the chicken breeding stock subsidiary.

Beef

The Company's beef operations are primarily involved in the processing of live
fed cattle and fabrication of dressed beef carcasses into primal and sub-primal
meat cuts and case-ready products.  It also involves deriving value from
allied products such as hides and variety meats for sale to further processors
and others.  The Beef segment markets its products to food retailers,
distributors, wholesalers, restaurants and hotel chains and other food
processors in domestic and international markets.  Allied products are also
marketed to manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and technical products.

Eight
of the Company's fed beef plants include hide processing facilities.  The
uncured hides from the Company's other fed beef plants are transported to these
facilities, which include brine curing operations and, in four locations, chrome
hide tanneries.  The chrome tanning process produces a semi-finished


product that is shipped to leather good
manufacturers worldwide.  Brine-cured hides are sold to other tanneries.  Tyson
is the largest chrome tanner of cattle hides in the United States.

Pork

The Company's pork operations involve the processing of live hogs and the
fabrication of pork and allied products. The Company's pork facilities produce
fresh boxed pork and case-ready products for shipment to customers, as well as
pork bellies, hams and boneless picnic meat for shipment to customers who
further process the pork into bacon, cooked hams, luncheon meats and sausage
items.  Throughout production, edible pork and allied products, such as variety
meat items, are segregated and prepared for shipment or further refinement.
 Inedible pork products derived from processing operations are used by further
processing to manufacture pet foods, technical products, pharmaceuticals and
cosmetics.

Additionally, the Company has farrow-to-finish swine operations, which include
genetic and nutritional research, weaned and feeder pig sales, feeder pig
finishing and the marketing of live swine to regional and national packers that
are conducted in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma.

Prepared Foods

The Company's prepared foods operations manufacture and market frozen and
refrigerated food products.  Products include pepperoni, beef and pork
toppings, pizza crusts, flour and corn tortilla products, appetizers, hors
d'oeuvres, desserts, prepared meals, ethnic foods, soups, sauces, side dishes,
specialty pasta and meat dishes as well as branded and processed meats.  The
Prepared Foods segment markets its products to food retailers, distributors,
wholesalers, restaurants and hotel chains.

Other

The
Company's other segment includes the logistics group and other corporate
activities not identified with specific protein groups.

RAW MATERIALS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY

Chicken

The primary raw materials used by the Company in its chicken operations consist
of live chickens that are raised primarily by independent contract growers.  The
Company's vertically-integrated chicken process begins with the grandparent
breeder flocks.  Breeder farms specialize in producing the generations of male
and female strains, with the broiler being the final progeny.  The breeder
flocks are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where
fertile eggs are produced.  The fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent
hatchery and produce male and female pullets (i.e., the parents).  The pullets
are sent to breeder houses, and the resulting eggs are sent to Company
hatcheries.  Once the chicks have hatched, they are sent to broiler farms.  There,
contract growers care for and raise the chicks according to Company standards while
receiving advice from Company technical service personnel until the broilers
have reached the desired processing weight.  The adult chickens are caught and
hauled to processing plants. The finished products are sent to distribution
centers and then transported to customers.  Vertically-integrated poultry
companies operate their own feed mills to produce scientifically-formulated
feeds.  Corn and soybean meal are major production costs in the poultry
industry, representing roughly 39% of the cost of growing a chicken.  In
addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens, the Company uses cooking
ingredients, packaging materials and cryogenic agents.  The Company believes
that its sources of supply for these materials are adequate for its present
needs and the Company does not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these
materials in the future.  While the Company produces substantially all of its
inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers, it may also purchase live,
ice-packed or deboned chicken to meet production requirements.

Beef

The primary raw material used by the Company in its beef operations is live
cattle.  The Company does not have facilities of its own to raise cattle in the
United States.  The Company has approximately 70 cattle buyers located
throughout cattle producing areas who visit feed yards and buy a majority of
the Company's live cattle on the open spot market.  These buyers are trained to
select high quality animals and their performance is continually measured by
the Company.  The Company also enters into various risk-sharing and procurement
arrangements with producers that help secure a supply of livestock for daily
start-up operations at its facilities.  The Company's Canadian subsidiary,
Lakeside Farm Industries LTD (Lakeside), primarily has cattle feeding
facilities and a beef carcass production and boxed beef processing facility.  In
2003, Lakeside's feedlots provided approximately 20% of that facility's fed
cattle needs.

Pork

The primary raw material used by the Company in its pork operations is live
swine.  The Company raises live swine to sell to outside processors and supplies
a minimal amount of live swine for its own processing needs.  The majority of
the Company's live swine supply is obtained through various procurement
arrangements with producers.  The Company also employs buyers who purchase hogs
on a daily basis, generally a few days before the animals


are
required for processing.

Prepared Foods

The primary raw materials used by the Company in its prepared foods operations
are typically commodity based raw materials, including fresh and frozen chicken,
beef and pork, corn, flour and frozen vegetables.  Some of these raw materials
are provided by the chicken, beef and pork segments and can also be purchased
from numerous suppliers and manufacturers.

SEASONAL DEMAND

The demand for the Company's chicken and beef products
generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases
during the winter months. The Company's pork and prepared foods products generally
experience increased demand during the winter months due to the holiday season
and decreased demand during the spring and summer months.

CUSTOMERS

No single customer of the Company accounts for more
than ten percent of the Company's consolidated revenues. However, the top three
customers of each segment represent approximately 26% of the Chicken segment's
sales, approximately 18% of the Beef segment's sales, approximately 22% of Pork
segment's sales and approximately 23% of the Prepared Foods segment's sales.
The Company believes the loss of any single customer would not have a material
adverse effect on the Company's business. Although, any extended discontinuance
of sales to any major customer could, if not replaced, have an impact on the
Company's operations, the Company does not anticipate any such occurrences due
to the demand for its products and its ability to obtain new customers.

BACKLOG OF ORDERS

There is no significant backlog of unfilled orders for
the Company's products.

COMPETITION

The Company's food products compete with those of
other national and regional food producers and processors and certain prepared
food manufacturers, namely, Hormel Foods Corporation, Swift and Company, Cargill
Incorporated, Smithfield Foods Inc., Pilgrims Pride Corp. and Sanderson Farms
Inc.  Additionally, the Company's food products compete in international
markets around the world.  The Company's principal marketing and competitive
strategy is to identify target markets for value-enhanced products, to
concentrate production, sales and marketing efforts in order to appeal to and
enhance the demand from those markets and, utilizing its national distribution
systems and customer support services, seek to achieve a leading market
position for its products.  Past efforts have indicated that customer demand
generally can be increased and sustained through application of the Company's
marketing strategy, as supported by its distribution systems.  The principal
competitive elements are brand identification, price, product quality, and
customer service.

INTERNATIONAL

The Company exported to more than 80 foreign countries
in fiscal 2003. Major export markets include Canada, China, European Union,
Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Russia, Taiwan and South Korea.

The
Company continues to explore growth opportunities in Asia, Russia, and Brazil
and believes each offers potential in terms of developing processing facilities. 
The Company's subsidiary in Mexico continues to show growth with a focus on
further processed chicken products.  The Company's wholly owned subsidiary,
Cobb-Vantress, has operations in Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Japan, the
Philippines, Spain, the United Kingdom, Venezuela and the Netherlands.  The
Company also owns a majority interest in and operates a chicken processing
facility in China and has equity interests in a Russian sausage processing
facility and a Chinese pork processing facility.  The Company continues to
be involved in a technical service agreement with Grupo Melo in Panama to assist
Grupo Melo with the production of further processed chicken products and to
allow it to license the Tyson brand.  Additional information regarding the
Company's export sales and long-lived assets located in foreign markets is set
forth in Note 17, "Segment Reporting" of the Consolidated Financial Statements
included herein at pages 51 through 52.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The Company conducts continuous research and
development activities to improve finished product development, to develop ways
to automate manual processes in its processing plants and growout operations and
to improve the strains of primary chicken breeding stock.  The annual cost of
such research and


development programs is less than one
percent of total consolidated annual sales.

REGULATION AND FOOD SAFETY

The Company's facilities for processing chicken, beef,
pork, prepared foods, milling feed and for housing live chicken and swine are
subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws relating to the
protection of the environment, including provisions relating to the discharge
of materials into the environment, and to the health and safety of its
employees.  The Company's chicken, beef and pork processing facilities are
participants in the government's Hazardous Analysis Critical Control Point
(HACCP) program and are subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterroism
Preparedness and Response Act of 2002.  The cost of compliance with such laws
and regulations has not had a material adverse effect upon the Company's
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position and it is not
anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future.  In 2003, the
Company incurred expenses of approximately $79 million to maintain compliance
with such regulations.  These expenditures relate principally to the normal
operation and maintenance of wastewater treatment facilities ("Wastewater
Treatment Facilities"), where the Company biologically treats these
wastes, and the associated land application of wastes generated at these
treatment facilities.
 The Company incurred $6 million in
capital expenditures, primarily related to its Wastewater Treatment Facilities,
in fiscal 2003 and anticipates capital expenditures of approximately $3 million
in fiscal 2004 for environmental projects primarily related to the Wastewater
Treatment Facilities.  The Company believes that it is in substantial
compliance with such applicable laws and regulations and the Company is not
aware of any violations of, or pending changes in, such laws and regulations
that are likely to result in material penalties or material increases in
compliance costs, except as disclosed in Item 3.

The
Company works to ensure its products meet high standards of food quality and
safety.   The Company's chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods products are
subject to inspection prior to distribution, primarily by the United States
Department of Agriculture.  Notwithstanding these efforts, food producers are
at risk that their products may contain pathogens unless the product has been
properly produced, handled and cooked.

The
Company is exposed to risk if its products are determined to be contaminated or
cause illness or injury.   These risks include (1) the cost of adverse
publicity and product recalls, including the associated negative consumer
reaction; (2) exposure to related civil litigation; and (3) regulatory
administrative penalties, which can include injunctive relief and other civil
remedies, including plant closings.

EMPLOYEES AND LABOR RELATIONS

As of September 27, 2003, the Company employed
approximately 120,000 persons. The Company believes that its overall relations
with its workforce are good.

Set forth
below is a listing of the Company facilities which have employees subject to a

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

The Company's principal marketing objective is to be
the primary provider of chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods products for our
customers.  The Company identifies distinct markets and business opportunities
through extensive consumer and market research.  The Company's branding
strategy focuses on one national protein brand, the Tyson brand, as well as a
number of strong regional brands.  All communications stress the quality and
value proposition of the products while supporting and building brand
awareness.  Communications efforts utilize a fully integrated and coordinated
mix of activities designed to connect with customers and consumers on both a
rational and emotional level. The Company utilizes its national distribution
system and customer support services to achieve the leading market position for
its products.

The Company
has the ability to produce and ship fresh, frozen and refrigerated products.  The
Company's nationwide distribution system utilizes a network of food distributors
which is supported by cold storage warehouses owned or leased by the Company,
by public cold storage facilities and by the Company's transportation system.  The
Company ships products from Company-owned consolidated frozen food distribution
centers, from a network of public cold storages, from other owned and leased
facilities and directly from plants.  The Company's distribution centers
facilitate accumulating frozen products so that it can fill and consolidate
less-than-truckload orders into full truckloads, thereby decreasing shipping
costs while increasing customer service. In addition, customers are provided
with a selection of products that do not require large volume orders.  The
Company's distribution system enables it to supply large or small quantities of
products to meet customer requirements anywhere in the continental United
States.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

The Company has registered a number of trademarks
relating to its products which either have been approved or are in the process
of application. Because the Company does a significant amount of brand name and
product line advertising to promote its products, it considers the protection
of such trademarks to be important to its marketing efforts.  The Company has
also developed non-public proprietary information regarding its production
processes and other product-related matters.  The Company utilizes internal
procedures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality of such information,
and where appropriate, seeks patent protection for the technology it utilizes.

INDUSTRY PRACTICES

The Company's agreements with its customers are
generally short-term, due primarily to the nature of its products, industry
practice and the fluctuation in demand and price for such products.  In certain
instances where the Company is selling further processed products to large
customers, the Company may enter into written agreements whereby the Company
will act as the exclusive or preferred supplier to the customer for periods up
to 5 years and on pricing terms which are either fixed or variable.

AVAILABILITY OF SEC FILINGS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
DOCUMENTS ON INTERNET WEBSITE

The Company maintains an internet website at www.tysonfoodsinc.com.

The
Company makes available free of charge under the section "Investors" of its
website its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and
current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to any of those reports, as
soon as reasonably practicable after providing such reports to the Securities
and Exchange Commission.  Also the Company's corporate governance principles,
Audit Committee charter, Compensation Committee charter, Governance Committee
charter and code of conduct are available under the section "Investors" on the
Company's website.  The Company's corporate governance documents are available
in print to any shareholder who requests them.

at 96% capacity.

Beef

The Company's beef operations consist of 14 beef production facilities, four of
which include case-ready operations, and a Canadian cattle feeding facility.  These
facilities slaughter live cattle, fabricate beef products and some treat and
tan hides.  One of the beef facilities contains a tallow refinery and two of
the case-ready operations share facilities with the pork segment.  The carcass
facilities reduce live cattle to dressed carcass form.  Fed beef consists
primarily of steers and heifers specifically raised for beef consumption.  The
processing facilities conduct fabricating operations to produce boxed beef and
allied products.  The processing facilities operated in 2003 at approximately 84%
of their production capacities.  The total slaughter capacity is approximately 240,000
head per week.

Pork

The Company's pork operations consist of eight pork production facilities, two
of which include case-ready operations.  These facilities slaughter live hogs
and fabricate pork products and allied products.  The two case-ready operations
share facilities with the beef segment.  The processing facilities operated in
2003 at approximately 82% of their production capacities.  The total slaughter
capacity of these facilities is approximately 427,000 head per week.  Additionally
the Company's live swine operations have 37 farrowing barns, 75 nursery houses
and 69 finishing houses.  The Company also utilizes live swine contract
growers.  The swine growout operations are supported by one dedicated feed mill
supplemented by production from the chicken operations' feed mills.

Prepared Foods

The Company's prepared foods operations consist of 34 processing plants which
process fresh beef, pork, chicken and other raw materials into pizza toppings,
branded and processed meats, appetizers, hors d'oeuvres, desserts, ethnic
foods, soups, sauces, side dishes and pizza crusts, flour and corn tortilla
products and specialty pasta and meat dishes.  These processing plants have the
capacity to produce approximately 61 million pounds per week and operated in
2003 at approximately 76% of capacity.

Other

The Company's other operations consist of 11 distribution centers, as well as 11
cold storage facilities used by the beef and pork divisions, 44 cold storage
facilities at chicken processing plants, three cold storage facilities at
chicken rendering plants and five cold storage facilities used by prepared
foods plants with a total capacity of approximately 300 million pounds.

The
Company owns its major operating facilities with the following exceptions: one
chicken emulsified plant is leased month to month, one hatchery is leased month
to month, 422 chicken breeder farm houses are leased under agreements expiring
at various dates through 2005, 31 chicken breeder farm


houses are leased month to month and 30 broiler
farms are leased year to year.  Additionally, the Company's live swine operation
leases 20 farrowing barns, 24 nursery houses and 38 finishing houses, with the
majority expiring in 2004.  One prepared foods distribution center is leased
month to month and two prepared foods further processing facilities are leased
until 2004 and 2005.

Management
believes the Company's present facilities are generally adequate and suitable
for its current purposes;  however, seasonal fluctuations in inventories and
production may occur as a reaction to market demands for certain products.  The
Company regularly engages in construction and other capital improvement
projects intended to expand capacity and improve the efficiency of its
processing and support facilities.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Refer to the discussion of
certain legal proceedings pending against the Company under Part II., Item 8.
Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, Note 19: Contingencies,
which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.  Listed below are certain
additional legal proceedings involving the Company and its subsidiaries.

In January 1997, the State of Illinois brought
suit in the Circuit Court for the 14th Judicial Circuit, Rock Island, Illinois,
Chancery Division against IBP alleging that IBP's operations at its Joslin,
Illinois, facility are violating the "odor nuisance" regulations
enacted in the State of Illinois. IBP has already completed additional
improvements at its Joslin facility to further reduce odors from this
operation, but denies Illinois EPA's contention that its operations at any time
amounted to a "nuisance."  The Illinois EPA has alleged a damage
claim of approximately $2,000,000.  IBP is attempting to discuss these issues
with the State of Illinois in an effort to reach a settlement.  In May 2003,
the State of Illinois attempted to add the Company as a defendant in the suit,
which the court subsequently denied.  In September 2003, the State of Illinois
served the Company with a complaint that had been filed in the Circuit Court
for the 14th Judicial Circuit, Rock Island, Illinois, Chancery Division
alleging substantially the same causes of action against the Company as had
been alleged in the action against IBP.  A motion to dismiss has been filed as
to all claims.

In June 2001,
IBP was advised the SEC had commenced a formal investigation related to the
restatement of earnings made by IBP in March 2001, including matters relating
to certain improprieties in the financial statements of DFG, a wholly-owned
subsidiary.  The Company has been informed that three former employees of DFG
received a so-called "Wells" notice advising them that the SEC had
determined to recommend the initiation of an enforcement action and providing
them an opportunity to provide their arguments against such an enforcement
action.  IBP is cooperating with this investigation, and to date the SEC has
made no claims against the Company.

In February 2002, the Company learned that a
processing facility owned by Zemco Industries, Inc., a subsidiary of IBP, is
the subject of an investigation by the U.S. Attorney's office in Bangor, Maine,
into allegedly improper testing and recording practices.  The Company acquired
Zemco as part of the Company's acquisition of IBP on September 28, 2001.  The
Company learned in November 2003 that a former Zemco employee at the processing
facility has agreed to plead guilty to charges in connection with the
investigation.  To date there has been no claim by the U.S. Attorney against Zemco,
and Zemco will continue to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's office.

Other Matters

The Company has approximately 120,000 team members and at any time has various
employment practices matters.  In the aggregate, these matters are significant
to the Company and the Company devotes significant resources to handling
employment issues.  Additionally, the Company is subject to other lawsuits,
investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial amounts) arising
out of the conduct of its business.  While the ultimate results of these matters
cannot be determined, they are not expected to have a material adverse effect
on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings for fiscal 2003 were $337 million or $0.96
per diluted share compared to $383 million or $1.08 per diluted share in fiscal
2002.  Fiscal 2003 pretax earnings include $167 million received in connection
with vitamin antitrust litigation and $76 million of costs related to the
closing of poultry operations during the first, third and fourth quarters of
fiscal 2003.

The Company's accounting cycle resulted in a 52-week
year for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001.

2003 vs. 2002

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior
periods to conform to current presentations.

Sales

increased $1.2 billion or 5.1%, with a slight increase in volume and a 5.0%
increase in price.

Cost of sales

increased $1.3 billion or 5.8%.  As a percent of sales, cost of sales was 92.9%
for 2003 compared to 92.2% for 2002.  This increase is primarily due to higher
live cattle prices in the Beef segment, increases in grain costs in the Chicken
segment and increased accruals related to ongoing litigation, partially offset
by $167 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

decreased $46 million or 5.4%.  As a percent of
sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 3.8% to
3.4%.  The decrease is primarily due to the expense reductions of approximately
$42 million related to the sale of Specialty Brands in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2002, and approximately $16 million associated with the ongoing
integration of Tyson and IBP, inc. (IBP) corporate functions.  Additional
decreases were due to favorable investment returns of approximately $18 million
on Company owned life insurance, actuarial gains of $13 million related to
changes in certain retiree medical benefit plans and decreased litigation costs
of approximately $19 million resulting primarily from the reversal of certain
legal accruals which are no longer required due to cases being closed.  The
decreases in selling, general and administrative expenses were partially offset
by increased professional fees of approximately $26 million primarily related to the
Company's ongoing integration and strategic initiatives and increased sales
promotions and marketing costs of approximately $45 million primarily due to
the introduction and rollout of several new products.

Other charges

include $76 million of plant closing costs incurred in fiscal 2003, and $53
million of charges incurred in fiscal 2002 related to the discontinuation of
the Thomas E. Wilson brand and the restructuring of the Company's live swine
operations.

Interest expense

decreased $9 million or 2.8% compared to 2002, primarily resulting
from an 8.2% decrease in the Company's average indebtedness.  As a percent of
sales, interest expense was 1.2% compared to 1.3% for 2002.  The overall weighted
average borrowing rate increased to 7.4% from 7.0%, primarily resulting from premiums
paid on bonds repurchased in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003. 
Excluding the premiums paid, interest expense decreased $21 million.

Other expense

increased
$29 million from the same period last year, primarily resulting from the $10
million write-down related to the impairment of an equity interest in a live
swine operation recorded in fiscal 2003, and the prior year gain of $22 million
from the sale of the Specialty Brands, Inc. subsidiary.

The effective tax rate

was 35.5% in both 2003 and
2002.  Several factors impact the effective tax rate including average state
income tax rates, the tax rates for international operations and the
Extraterritorial Income Exclusion (ETI) for foreign sales. Taxes on
international earnings were comparable for 2003 and 2002. Average state taxes
added 2.2% and 3% to the effective tax rate for 2003 compared to 2002 and ETI
reduced the effective rate by 1.9% in 2003 compared to a 1.4% reduction in
2002.  Various legislative bills have been introduced in 2003 which would
repeal the ETI exclusion over a period of time, and replace ETI with a partial
tax exclusion for certain domestic production activities.  If the ETI exclusion
is repealed and replacement legislation is not enacted,


the loss of the ETI tax
benefit may adversely impact the Company's effective tax rate.

Segment Information

Tyson operates in five business segments: Chicken, Beef,
Pork, Prepared Foods and Other.  The Company measures segment profit as
operating income.

Chicken segment

is primarily involved in the processing of live chickens into fresh, frozen and
value-added chicken products sold through domestic foodservice, domestic food
retailers, wholesale club markets that service small foodservice operations,
small businesses and individuals, as well as specialty and commodity
distributors who deliver to restaurants, schools and international markets
throughout the world.  The Chicken segment also includes sales from allied
products and the chicken breeding stock subsidiary.

Beef segment

is primarily involved in the
processing of live fed cattle and fabrication of dressed beef carcasses into
primal and sub-primal meat cuts and case-ready products.  It also involves
deriving value from allied products such as hides and variety meats for sale to
further processors and others.  The Beef segment markets its products to food
retailers, distributors, wholesalers, restaurants, hotel chains and other
food processors in domestic and international markets.  Allied products are
also marketed to manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and technical products.

Pork segment

is primarily involved in the processing of live market hogs and fabrication of
pork carcasses into primal and sub-primal meat cuts and case-ready products. 
This segment also represents the Company's live swine group and related allied
product processing activities.  The Pork segment markets its products to food
retailers, distributors, wholesalers, restaurants, hotel chains and other
food processors in domestic and international markets.  It also sells allied
products to pharmaceutical and technical products manufacturers, as well as
live swine and weaned and feeder pigs to pork producers.

Prepared Foods

segment

includes the Company's operations that manufacture and market
frozen and refrigerated food products.  Products include pepperoni, beef and
pork toppings, pizza crusts, flour and corn tortilla products, appetizers, hors
d'oeuvres, desserts, prepared meals, ethnic foods, soups, sauces, side dishes,
specialty pasta and meat dishes as well as branded and processed meats.  The
Prepared Foods segment markets its products to food retailers, distributors,
wholesalers, restaurants and hotel chains.

Chicken segment

sales increased $205 million or 2.8%, with a slight decrease in average
sales prices and a 3.3% increase in volume.  Foodservice chicken sales dollars
increased 4.2%, retail chicken sales dollars increased 2.3% and international
chicken sales dollars decreased 3.6%.  Chicken segment operating income
decreased $270 million from the same period last year primarily due to
increased grain costs and plant closing costs.

Beef segment

sales increased $1.4 billion or 13.8%, with a 13.2% increase in average sales
prices and a slight increase in volume.  Case-ready beef sales were $957
million and increased 20.4%, domestic fresh meat beef sales increased 11.8% and
international beef sales increased 19.4%.  Beef segment operating income
increased $100 million.  The Beef segment sales and operating income increases
were caused by strong demand during the second half of fiscal 2003 caused in
part by the U.S. ban on Canadian beef.  However, these increases were partially
offset by an increase in live cattle prices.

Pork segment

sales decreased $33 million or 1.3%, with a 2.9% increase in average sales
prices and a 4.1% decrease in volume.  Case-ready pork sales were $221 million
and increased 52.3%, domestic fresh meat pork sales decreased 3.5%, international
pork sales increased 2.8% and live swine sales decreased 42.6%.  Pork segment
operating income increased $50 million.  Excluding the fourth quarter 2002 live
swine restructuring charge of $26 million, operating income increased $24
million.  The decline in sales is primarily due to a reduction in live swine
sales as a result of the prior year live swine restructuring and lower average
selling prices for our finished product.  Operating income was positively
affected by the prior year restructuring of the live swine operation, partially
offset by higher live hog prices.

Prepared Foods segment

sales decreased $410 million or 13.4%, with a 5.9%
decrease in average sales prices and an 8.0% decrease in volume.  Excluding
prior year Specialty Brands sales of $244 million, segment sales declined $166
million and volume declined slightly.  Segment operating income decreased $101
million from the same period last year.  Excluding the prior year Thomas E.
Wilson brand write-down of $27 million, operating income declined $128
million.  This decline results primarily from the increases during the year in
raw material prices, lower average selling prices, increased costs related to
the introduction of more than 75 new products this year and temporary operating
inefficiencies at certain plants.

Other segment

operating income increased $171
million primarily due to settlements received in connection with the vitamin
antitrust litigation.  Current year results include $167 million as compared to
$30 million received in fiscal 2002.  Additionally, operating income was
positively affected by actuarial gains of $13 million resulting from changes to
certain retiree medical benefit plans.

2002 vs. 2001

On August 3, 2001, the Company acquired 50.1%
ownership of IBP and acquired the remaining 49.9% on September 28, 2001. Accordingly, fiscal 2002 earnings include 52 weeks of
IBP's results of operations, while fiscal 2001 fourth quarter and 12
months results include 50.1% of IBP's results for the nine weeks ended
September 29, 2001.  This information should be considered when comparing to fiscal
2001 results of operations.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior
periods to conform to current presentations.

In accordance with the provisions issued in Financial
Accounting Standards Board No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"
which the Company adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2002,
goodwill and indefinite lived assets are no longer amortized.  The effect on fiscal
year 2001 results would have been an increase of approximately $0.14 cents per diluted
share.

In accordance with the guidance provided in Emerging
Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-14, "Accounting for Certain Sales
Incentives," and EITF Issue No. 00-25, "Vendor Income Statement
Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products,"
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company classifies the costs
associated with sales incentives provided to retailers and payments such as
slotting fees and cooperative advertising to vendors as a reduction in sales. 
These costs were previously included in selling, general and administrative
expense.  These reclassifications resulted in a reduction to sales and selling,
general and administrative expense of approximately $188 million for fiscal year
2001, and had no impact on reported income before income taxes and minority
interest, net income or earnings per share amounts.


Sales

increased $13 billion or 121.2%, with a 98.9% increase in volume and an 11.2%
increase in price.  The increase in sales volume and price is primarily due to
the inclusion of IBP's sales in fiscal 2002.  Despite lower commodity prices, sales prices increased due to product
mix changes as the Company's value-added businesses grew.

Cost of sales

increased $12 billion or 123.1%, primarily due to the inclusion of IBP's cost
of sales in fiscal 2002. As a percent of sales, cost of sales was 92.2% for
2002 compared to 91.5% for 2001.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

increased $290 million or 49.5%, primarily due to the
inclusion of IBP's operations in fiscal 2002.    As a percent of sales,
operating expenses were 3.8% for 2002 compared to 5.6% in 2001.  In its effort
to integrate, restructure and reorganize, the Company improved efficiencies and
lowered plant operating costs.  These costs were also reduced through other
cost-containment efforts and improved sales expense management.

Other charges

include
$27 million related to the discontinuation of the Thomas E. Wilson brand and
$26 million related to the restructuring of the Company's live swine operation.

Interest expense

increased 111.8% compared to 2001. As a percent of sales, interest
expense was 1.3% compared to 1.4% for 2001.  The Company's average indebtedness
increased by 109.7% over fiscal 2001 due to debt incurred to purchase IBP.  The
Company's short-term interest rates decreased to 3.3% in fiscal 2002 as
compared to 5.1% in fiscal 2001.  The overall weighted average borrowing rate
on total debt was 7.0% for fiscal 2002 compared to 6.9% for fiscal 2001.

Other income

increased
in the current year due to a gain of $22 million from the sale of the Specialty
Brands, Inc. subsidiary.

The effective tax rate

was 35.5% in 2002 compared to 35.4% in 2001.  The
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS
No. 142),
at the beginning of 2002.  Under SFAS No. 142 the Company no longer amortized
goodwill which resulted in a decrease in the effective tax rate for 2002,
offset primarily by a reduction in the foreign sales benefit.

Segment Information

For the periods ending September 28, 2002, and
September 29, 2001, the following information includes 100% of IBP results for
52 weeks and nine weeks, respectively. Information on segments is as follows:

Chicken segment

sales increased $165 million or 2.3% compared to 2001, with a 1.1% increase in
average sale prices and a 1.2% increase in volume.


Foodservice
chicken sales increased 4.9%, retail chicken sales increased 2.0% and
international chicken sales decreased 6.3%.  In fiscal 2002, the Company's
Mexican subsidiary sales increased 36.1% due to the acquisition of a production
facility in Mexico in the third quarter of 2001.  This increase was more
than offset by decreases in other international sales demand as markets were
impacted by import restrictions and political pressures primarily in Russia and
China.  Operating income for Chicken increased $178 million as compared to
2001, primarily due to decreases in live and production costs along with
improvements in price and growth in value-added product mix.  Additionally,
fiscal 2001 costs were negatively impacted by weather related effects and higher
grain and energy costs.

Beef segment

sales were $10.5 billion, including beef case-ready sales of $795 million and
international beef sales of $1.4 billion.  Beef segment operating income
totaled $220 million.  The Beef segment resulted from the acquisition of IBP in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.

Pork segment

sales including IBP's pork processing revenues were $2.5 billion compared to
$619 million in 2001, including fiscal 2002 pork case-ready sales of $145
million and international pork sales of $248 million.  Pork segment operating
income decreased $2 million from 2001.  Sales and operating income were
positively affected by the inclusion of the IBP pork processing results in
fiscal 2002.  However, both were impacted by the negative results of the live
swine operation.  Operating income was also affected by the restructuring
charge related to the Company's live swine operation of approximately $26
million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002.

Prepared Foods segment

sales increased $2.3 billion compared to 2001.  The
Prepared Foods segment operating income increased $143 million.  The increase
in both sales and operating income is primarily due to the inclusion of IBP
results.  Operating income was also influenced by lower and more stable raw
material prices and improvement in product mix.  These increases were partially
offset by the Thomas E. Wilson write-down of $27 million related to the
discontinuation of the brand.

Other segment

operating income increased $64 million primarily due to the partial settlement
of approximately $30 million received in the third quarter of fiscal 2002
related to vitamin antitrust litigation combined with prior year IBP merger
related expenses of $19 million.

ACQUISITIONS

In August 2001, the Company acquired 50.1% of IBP by
paying approximately $1.7 billion in cash.  In September 2001, the Company
issued approximately 129 million shares of Class A stock, with a fair value of
approximately $1.2 billion, to acquire the remaining IBP shares, and assumed
approximately $1.7 billion of IBP debt.  The total acquisition cost of approximately
$4.6 billion was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with SFAS No. 141,
"Business Combinations."  Accordingly, the tangible and identifiable intangible
assets and liabilities have been adjusted to fair values with the remainder of
the purchase price recorded as goodwill.  The allocation of the purchase price
has been completed.

In May 2002, the Company acquired the assets of
Millard Processing Services, a bacon processing operation, for approximately
$73 million in cash. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase, and
goodwill of approximately $14 million has been recorded.

DISPOSITION

In September 2002, the Company completed the sale of
its Specialty Brands, Inc. subsidiary.  The subsidiary had been acquired with
the IBP acquisition and its results of operations were included in the
Company's Prepared Foods segment.  The Company received cash proceeds of
approximately $131 million, which were used to reduce indebtedness, and
recognized a pretax gain of $22 million.  Specialty Brands, Inc.'s sales and
operating income for the year ended September 28, 2002, were $244 million and
$2 million, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash provided by operations continues to be the
Company's primary source of funds to finance operating requirements and capital
expenditures. In 2003, net cash of $820 million was provided by operating
activities, down $354 million from 2002.  The decrease from fiscal 2002 is
primarily due to a net change in working capital of $423 million and a decrease
in net income of $46 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred taxes
of $91 million.  The change in working capital is primarily due to increased
accounts receivable resulting from increased sales and increased inventory
values, as well as the timing of cash receipts and payments related to other
working capital items.  The Company's foreseeable cash needs for operations
and capital expenditures are expected to


continue to be met through cash flows provided by
operating activities.  Additionally, at September 27, 2003, the Company had
borrowing capacity of $1.5 billion consisting of $705 million available under
its $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities and $750 million under its
accounts receivable securitization.  At September 27, 2003, the Company had
construction projects in progress that will require approximately $175 million
to complete.  Capital spending for fiscal 2004 is expected to be in the
range of $450 to $500 million, which includes spending on plant automation as
well as information systems technology improvements.  Additionally, on
December 5, 2003, the Company announced that in order to further improve
long-term manufacturing efficiencies, it will be closing facilities in
Manchester, New Hampshire, and Augusta, Maine, in early 2004.  The Company
anticipates recording pretax charges related to these closings of approximately
$23 to $27 million or $0.04 to $0.05 per diluted share in the first half of
fiscal 2004.

has unsecured revolving credit facilities totaling $1 billion that support the
Company's commercial paper program. These $1 billion in facilities consist of
$200 million that expire in June 2004, $300 million that expire in June 2005
and $500 million that expire in September 2006. At September 27, 2003, there
were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities. Additional outstanding
debt at September 27, 2003, consisted of $3.3 billion of debt securities, $32
million of commercial paper and other indebtedness of $256 million.

The revolving credit facilities, senior notes, notes
and accounts receivable securitization contain various covenants, the more
restrictive of which contain a maximum allowed leverage ratio and a minimum
required interest coverage ratio.  The Company is in compliance with these
covenants at fiscal year end.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are
material to its financial position or results of operations. The off-balance
sheet arrangements the Company has are guarantees of debt of outside third
parties involving letters of credit, a lease, 
grower loans and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases
for various types of equipment. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussions of these guarantees.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51" (the
Interpretation).  The Interpretation requires the consolidation of variable
interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity's
expected losses, receives a majority of the entity's expected residual returns,
or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in
the entity.  Currently, entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise
that has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority
voting interest in the entity.  The Interpretation was originally effective immediately
for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and effective in
the fourth quarter of the Company's fiscal 2003 for those created prior to
February 1, 2003.  However, in October 2003, the FASB deferred the effective
date for those variable interest entities created prior to February 1, 2003,
until the Company's first quarter of fiscal 2004.  The Company has substantially
completed the process of evaluating the Interpretation and believes its
adoption will not have a material impact on its financial position or results
of operations.

In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 149, "Amendment of Statement No. 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS No. 149).  SFAS No. 149 amends SFAS No.
133 to provide clarification on the financial accounting and reporting of
derivative


instruments and hedging activities and requires that contracts with
similar characteristics be accounted for on a comparable basis.  The standard
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and
for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003.  The Company's
adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have a material impact on its financial
position or results of operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting
for Certain Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity" (SFAS
No.
150).   SFAS No. 150 establishes how an issuer classifies and measures certain
freestanding financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and
equity and requires that such instruments be classified as liabilities.  The
standard is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after
May 31, 2003 and is otherwise effective in the fourth quarter of the Company's fiscal
2003.  The Company's adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material impact on
its financial position or results of operations.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of consolidated financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions.  These estimates and
assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The
following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by
the Company.

Financial instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to
manage its exposure to various market risks, including certain livestock, natural
gas, interest rates and grain and feed costs. The Company may hold positions as
economic hedges for which hedge accounting is not applied.  See Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks.

Contingent liabilities

The Company is subject to lawsuits, investigations and
other claims related to wage and hour/labor, cattle procurement, securities, environmental,
product and other matters, and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse
judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable
losses.  A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these
contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue. 
These reserves may change in the future due to changes in the Company's
assumptions, the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond the
Company's control.  See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accrued self insurance

Insurance expense for casualty claims and
employee-related health care benefits are estimated using historical experience
and actuarial estimates.  The assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses
are reviewed regularly by management.  However, actual expenses could differ from
these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized.

Impairment of Long-Lived assets

The Company is required to assess potential
impairments to its long-lived assets, which are primarily property, plant and
equipment.  If impairment indicators are present, the Company must measure the
fair value of the assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets," to determine if adjustments are to be recorded.

Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment

In assessing the recoverability of the Company's
goodwill and other intangible assets, management must make assumptions
regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair
value of the respective assets.  If these estimates and related assumptions
change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges
not previously recorded.  On September 30, 2001, the Company adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets," and was required to assess its goodwill for impairment issues upon
adoption, and then at least annually thereafter.  See Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.


ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT
MARKET RISKS

MARKET RISK

Market risks relating to the
Company's operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices,
interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk
concentrations. To address certain of these risks, the Company enters into
various derivative transactions as described below.  If a derivative instrument
is a hedge, as defined by SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities" (SFAS No. 133), as amended, depending on the nature of
the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will be either offset
against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm
commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income
(loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  The ineffective
portion of an instrument's change in fair value, as defined by SFAS No. 133, as
amended, will be immediately recognized in earnings as a component of cost of
sales.  Instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are
marked to fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported currently in
earnings.  Additionally, the Company holds
certain positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures and options, for
which it does not apply hedge accounting, but instead marks these positions to
fair value through earnings at each reporting date.

The sensitivity analyses presented below are the
measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes
in market prices related to commodities and hypothetical changes in exchange
rates related to interest rates.  Sensitivity analyses do not consider the
actions management may take to mitigate the Company's exposure to changes, nor
do they consider the effects that such hypothetical adverse changes may have on
overall economic activity.  Actual changes in market prices may differ from
hypothetical changes.

Commodities Risk

The Company is a purchaser of certain commodities, such as corn,
soybeans, livestock and natural gas in the course of normal operations.  The
Company uses commodity futures and options for hedging purposes to reduce the
effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying
commodity.  Generally, contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those
of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation.
Contracts that are highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and
correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting.  The following table
presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in
market prices as of September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively,
on fair value of open positions.  The fair value of such positions is a
summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net
position at quoted futures prices.  The market risk exposure analysis includes hedge
and non-hedge positions.  The underlying commodities hedged have a correlation
to price changes of the derivative positions such that the values of the
commodities hedged based on differences between commitment prices and market
prices and the value of the derivative positions used to hedge these commodity
obligations are inversely correlated.  The following sensitivity analysis
reflects an inverse impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open
positions for livestock and natural gas and a direct impact on earnings for
changes in the fair value of open positions for grain.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company has exposure to changes in interest rates on its
fixed-rate, long-term debt.  Market risk for fixed-rate, long-term debt is
estimated as the potential increase in fair value, resulting from a
hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates, and amounts to approximately $62
million at September 27, 2003.  The fair values of the Company's long-term debt
were estimated based upon quoted market prices and or published interest rates.

The Company hedges exposure to changes in interest
rates on certain of its financial instruments. Under the terms of various
leveraged equipment loans, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements
to effectively lock in a fixed interest rate for these borrowings. The maturity
dates of these leveraged


equipment loans range from 2005 to 2008 with
interest rates ranging from 4.7% to 6.0%.  Because of the positions taken
with respect to these swap agreements, an increase in interest rates would have
a minimal effect on the fair value for fiscal years 2003 and 2002.

Foreign Currency Risk

The Company also periodically enters into foreign
exchange forward contracts to hedge some of its foreign currency exposure.  The
Company enters into forward contracts to hedge exposure to U.S.
currency fluctuations inherent in its receivables and purchase commitments.  There
were no such contracts outstanding at September 27, 2003, and the fair value of
forward contracts at September 28, 2002, was not significant.  Foreign forward
contracts generally have maturities or expirations not exceeding 12 months.  A
10% change in the exchange rate of the currencies hedged at September 28, 2002,
would have changed the fair value of the contracts by $4 million.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company's financial instruments that are exposed
to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and
trade receivables. The Company's cash equivalents are in high quality
securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations
of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number
of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. The Company performs
periodic credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally
does not require collateral.  At September 27, 2003, approximately 10.3% of the
Company's net accounts receivable balance was due from one customer.  No other single
customer or customer group represents greater than 10% of net accounts
receivable.

NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Description of Business:

Tyson Foods, Inc.
(collectively, the "Company" or "Tyson"), founded in 1935 with world headquarters
in Springdale, Arkansas, is the world's largest processor and marketer of
chicken, beef and pork and the second largest food company in the

Fortune

500. Tyson Foods produces a wide variety of brand name protein-based
and prepared food products marketed in the United States and more than 80
countries around the world. Tyson is the recognized market leader in the retail
and foodservice markets it serves. The Company has approximately 120,000 team
members and 300 facilities and offices in 27 states and 22 countries.

Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority-owned
and wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal Year:

The Company utilizes a 52- or 53-week accounting period that ends on the
Saturday closest to September 30.

Reclassifications:

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform
to current presentations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash equivalents consist of investments in
short-term, highly liquid securities having original maturities of three months
or less, which are made as part of the Company's cash management activity. The
carrying values of these assets approximate their fair market values.  The
Company primarily utilizes a cash management system with a series of separate
accounts consisting of lockbox accounts for receiving cash, concentration
accounts that funds are moved to, and several "zero-balance" disbursement
accounts for funding of payroll, accounts payable and grower payments.  As a
result of the Company's cash management system, checks issued, but not
presented to the banks for payment, may create negative book cash balances.
Checks outstanding in excess of related book cash balances totaling
approximately $313 million at September 27, 2003, and $292 million at September
28, 2002, are included in trade accounts payable and accrued salaries, wages
and benefits.

Inventories:

Processed products, livestock (excluding breeders) and supplies and other are
valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.  Livestock
includes live cattle, live chicken and live swine.  Cost includes purchased raw
materials, live purchase costs, grow-out costs (primarily feed, contract grower
pay and catch and haul costs), labor and manufacturing and production
overhead which are related to the purchase and production of inventories.  Live
chicken consists of broilers and breeders.  Breeders are stated as cost less
amortization.  The costs associated with breeders, including breeder chicks,
feed and medicine, are accumulated up to the production stage and amortized to
broiler inventory over the productive life of the flock using a standard unit of
production.

Total inventory consists of:

Depreciation:

Depreciation is provided primarily by the straight-line method using estimated
lives for buildings and leasehold improvements of 10 to 39 years, machinery and
equipment of three to 12 years and other of three to 20 years.

Long-Lived assets:

The Company reviews the carrying value of
long-lived assets at each balance sheet date if indication of impairment exists. 
Recoverability is assessed using undiscounted cash flows based upon historical
results and current projections of earnings before interest and taxes.  The
Company measures impairment using discounted cash flows of future operating
results based upon a rate that corresponds to the Company's cost of capital. 
Impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent that carrying
value exceeds discounted cash flows of future operations.


Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:

Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are recorded
at fair value and not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least
annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise, as required by SFAS
No. 142.  Goodwill has been allocated to and tested for impairment by reporting
unit based on fair value of identifiable assets.  This goodwill is not
deductible for income tax purposes.  For fiscal year 2001, goodwill arising
prior to the IBP transaction was amortized on a straight-line basis over
periods ranging from 15 to 40 years.  Had the provisions of SFAS No. 142 been
in effect during fiscal year 2001, a reduction in amortization expense and an increase
to net income of $30 million or $0.14 per diluted share, would have been
recorded.  At September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, the accumulated
amortization of goodwill was $286 million.

Amount of goodwill by segment at September 27, 2003,

patents and $13 million of supply contracts with accumulated amortization of
$12 million and $6 million for patents and supply contracts, respectively.  At
September 28, 2002, the gross carrying value of intangible assets consisted of
$100 million of trademarks, $87 million of patents and $13 million of supply
contracts with accumulated amortization of $6 million and $4 million for
patents and supply contracts, respectively.  Amortization expense on combined
patents and supply contracts of $8 million and $9 million was recognized during
2003 and 2002, respectively.  Amortization expense on intangible assets is
estimated to be $8 million for 2004, 2005 and 2006, and $6 million for 2007 and
2008.  Patents and supply contracts are amortized using the straight-line
method over their estimated period of benefit of 15 years and five years,
respectively.

Investments:

The
Company has investments in joint ventures and other entities.  The Company uses
the cost method of accounting where its voting interests are less than 20
percent, and the equity method of accounting where its voting interests are in
excess of 20 percent but not greater than 50 percent.  The Company's underlying
share of each entity's equity is reported in the consolidated balance sheet in
the line item Other Assets.

Accrued self insurance:

Insurance expense for casualty claims and
employee-related health care benefits are estimated using historical experience
and actuarial estimates.

Capital Stock:

Holders of Class B common stock (Class B stock) may convert such stock into
Class A common stock (Class A stock) on a share-for-share basis. Holders of
Class B stock are entitled to 10 votes per share while holders of Class A stock
are entitled to one vote per share on matters submitted to shareholders for
approval. Cash dividends cannot be paid to holders of Class B stock unless they
are simultaneously paid to holders of Class A stock. The per share amount of
the cash dividend paid to holders of Class B stock cannot exceed 90% of the
cash dividend simultaneously paid to holders of Class A stock. The Company pays
quarterly cash dividends to Class A and Class B shareholders. The Company paid
Class A dividends per share of $0.16 and Class B dividends per share of $0.144
in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Stock Options:

On December 29, 2002, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards No.
148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and
Disclosure" (SFAS No. 148).  SFAS No. 148, which amended FASB Statement No.
123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," does not require use
of the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. 
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for its employee stock option plans. 
Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized for its stock option
plans.  Had compensation cost for the employee stock option plans been
determined based on the fair value method of accounting for the Company's stock
option plans, the tax-effected impact would be as follows:

Financial Instruments:

The Company is a purchaser of certain commodities, such
as corn, soybeans, livestock and natural gas in the course of normal operations. 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to
various market risks.  Generally, contract terms of a hedge instrument closely
mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of risk reduction and
correlation. Contracts that are highly effective at meeting the risk reduction
and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting, as defined by SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS No. 133), as amended. 
If a derivative instrument is a hedge,
depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the
instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged
assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in
other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in
earnings.  The ineffective portion of an instrument's change in fair value will
be immediately recognized in earnings as a component of cost of sales. 
Instruments the Company holds as economic hedges that do not meet the criteria
for hedge accounting, as defined by SFAS No. 133, as amended, are marked to
fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported currently in earnings.  The
Company generally does not hedge anticipated transactions beyond 12 months.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss are
transferred to customers, which is generally upon delivery based upon terms of
sale.  Revenue is recognized as the net amount estimated to be received after
deducting estimated amounts for discounts, trade allowances and product terms.

Litigation Reserves:

There are a variety of legal proceedings pending or
threatened against the Company. Accruals are recorded when it is probable that
a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably
estimated based on current law, progress of each case, opinions and views of
legal counsel and other advisers, the Company's experience in similar matters
and management's intended response to the litigation. These amounts, which are
not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties, are adjusted
periodically as assessment efforts progress or legal information becomes
available. Accruals for legal proceedings are included in other current
liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets.

Freight Expense:

Freight expense associated with products shipped to customers is
recognized in cost of products sold.

Advertising and Promotion Expenses:

Advertising and promotion expenses are charged to
operations in the period incurred. Advertising and promotion expenses for
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $504 million, $396 million and $337 million,
respectively.

Minority Interest:

The results of operations of IBP for the nine weeks ended September 29, 2001,
are included in the Company's consolidated results of


operations.  Minority interest in fiscal 2001 primarily consisted of the
49.9% of IBP that was acquired on September 28, 2001.

Use of Estimates:

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards:

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51" (the
Interpretation).  The Interpretation requires the consolidation of variable
interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity's
expected losses, receives a majority of the entity's expected residual returns,
or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in
the entity.  Currently, entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise
that has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority
voting interest in the entity.  The Interpretation was originally immediately
effective for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and
effective in the fourth quarter of the Company's fiscal 2003 for those created
prior to February 1, 2003.  However, in October 2003, the FASB deferred the
effective date for those variable interest entities created prior to February
1, 2003, until the Company's first quarter of fiscal 2004.  The Company has substantially
completed the process of evaluating the Interpretation and believes its
adoption will not have a material impact on its financial position or results
of operations.

In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS No. 149).  SFAS No. 149 amends SFAS No.
133 to provide clarification on the financial accounting and reporting of
derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires that contracts with
similar characteristics be accounted for on a comparable basis.  The standard
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and
for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003.  The Company's
adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have a material impact on its financial
position or results of operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting
for Certain Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity"
(SFAS No. 150).   SFAS No. 150 establishes how an issuer classifies and measures certain freestanding
financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity and
requires that such instruments be classified as liabilities.  The standard is
effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003,
and is otherwise effective in the fourth quarter of the Company's fiscal 2003. 
The Company's adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material impact on its
financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 2: ACQUISITIONS

In September 2003, the
Company purchased Choctaw Maid Farms, Inc. (Choctaw), an integrated poultry
processor.  Since 1992, Tyson had been purchasing all of Choctaw's production
under a "cost plus" supply agreement, which was scheduled to expire in 2007. 
The Company had previously negotiated a purchase option with Choctaw's owners,
which initially became exercisable in 2002.  The Company decided to exercise
its purchase option rather than continue under the "cost plus" arrangement of
the supply agreement.  The acquisition has been recorded as a purchase in
accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations."  Accordingly, the assets
and liabilities have been adjusted for fair values with the remainder of the
purchase price, $18 million, recorded as goodwill. The purchase price consisted
of $1 million cash to exercise the purchase option in Tyson's supply agreement
with Choctaw and the settlement of $85 million owed to Tyson by Choctaw. In
addition the Company assumed approximately $4 million of Choctaw's debt to a
third party.  In June 2003, the Company exercised a $74 million purchase option
to acquire assets leased from a third party which the Company had subleased to
Choctaw.  Pro forma operating results reflecting the acquisition of Choctaw
would not be materially different from the Company's actual results of
operations.

In May 2002, the Company acquired the assets of
Millard Processing Services, a bacon processing operation, for approximately
$73 million in cash. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and
goodwill of approximately $14 million has been recorded.

In August 2001, the Company acquired 50.1% of IBP by
paying approximately $1.7 billion in cash.  In September 2001, the Company
issued approximately 129 million shares of Class A stock, with a fair value of
approximately $1.2 billion, to acquire the remaining IBP shares, and assumed
approximately $1.7


billion of IBP debt.  The total acquisition cost of approximately
$4.6 billion was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with SFAS No. 141
"Business Combinations."  Accordingly, the tangible and identifiable intangible
assets and liabilities have been adjusted to fair values with the remainder of
the purchase price recorded as goodwill.  The allocation of the purchase price
has been completed.

NOTE 3: DISPOSITION

In September 2002, the Company completed the sale of
its Specialty Brands, Inc. subsidiary.  The subsidiary had been acquired with
the IBP acquisition, and its results of operations were included in the
Company's Prepared Foods segment.  The Company received cash proceeds of
approximately $131 million, which were used to reduce indebtedness, and recognized
a pretax gain of $22 million, which is included in other income on the
consolidated statement of income of fiscal 2002.

NOTE 4: OTHER CHARGES

In April 2003, the Company announced its decision to
close its Berlin, Maryland, poultry operation as part of its ongoing plant
rationalization efforts.  The Berlin poultry operation employed approximately
650 people and included a hatchery, a feed mill, live production and a
processing facility.  The facility ceased processing chickens November 12,
2003.  As a result of this decision, the Company is anticipating total costs of
$29 million that include $14 million of costs related to closing the plant and
$15 million of estimated impairment charges for assets to be disposed of.  The
costs related to closing the plant include $9 million for estimated liabilities
for the resolution of the Company's obligations under 209 grower contracts, and
$5 million of other related costs associated with the closing of the plant
including plant clean-up costs and employee termination benefits.  The Company
is accounting for the closing of the Berlin operations in accordance with SFAS
No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities."  In
fiscal 2003, the Company recorded accruals of $25 million ($19 million in the
third quarter and $6 million in the fourth quarter) that included $10 million
of costs related to closing the plant and $15 million of estimated impairment
charges for assets to be disposed.  This amount is reflected in the Chicken
segment as a reduction of operating income and included in the consolidated
statements of income in other charges.  The costs related to closing the plant that
have been accrued as of September 27, 2003, include $7 million for estimated
liabilities for the resolution of the Company's obligations under grower
contracts and $3 million of other related costs associated with the closing of
the plant, including plant clean-up costs and employee termination benefits. 
At September 27, 2003, the accrual balance was $16 million, as $4 million of
obligations under grower contracts and $3 million of other closing costs had
been paid, and losses related to the disposal of assets of $2 million were
realized.  The Company anticipates recording additional costs of approximately
$4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 related to closing the plant.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company
recorded a $47 million accrual of costs related to the closing of its Stilwell,
Oklahoma, and Jacksonville, Florida, plants that includes $26 million of costs
related to closing the plants and $21 million of estimated impairment charges
for assets to be disposed.  The costs related to closing the plants include
$17 million for estimated liabilities for the resolution of the Company's
obligations under grower contracts, and $9 million of other related costs
associated with the closing of the plants including plant clean-up costs and
employee termination benefits. The costs are reflected in the Chicken segment
as a reduction of operating income and included in the consolidated statements
of income in other charges.  At September 27, 2003, the remaining accrual
balance for closing the two poultry operations was $2 million, as $16 million
of obligations under grower contracts and $12 million of other closing costs
had been paid, and losses related to the disposal of assets of $17 million were
realized. No material adjustments to the total accrual are anticipated at this
time.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company
recorded a $26 million accrual for restructuring its live swine operations that
consists of $21 million of estimated liabilities for resolution of Company
obligations under producer contracts and $5 million of other related costs
associated with this restructuring including lagoon and pit closure costs and
employee termination benefits.  At September 27, 2003, the remaining accrual
balance was $16 million, as $6 million of obligations under grower contracts
and $4 million of other related costs had been paid.  No material adjustments
to the total accrual are anticipated at this time.

In August 2002, the Company made the decision to
capitalize on the strong recognition of the Tyson brand by expanding the Tyson
brand to beef and pork.  Thus, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 the
Company recorded a write-down of $27 million related to the discontinuation of
the Thomas E. Wilson brand.


This amount is reflected in the Prepared Foods
segment as a reduction to operating income and included on the consolidated
statement of income in other charges.

NOTE 5: ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

At September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, the
allowance for doubtful accounts was $16 million and $26 million, respectively.

NOTE 6: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company recognizes all derivatives on the balance
sheet at fair value as required by SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended.  Derivatives that are not
hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. If the derivative is a
hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of
derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the
hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized
in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in
earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value is
recognized in earnings.

The Company had derivative related
balances totaling $20 million and $1 million recorded in other current assets
at September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively, and $37 million and
$19 million recorded in other current liabilities at September 27, 2003, and
September 28, 2002, respectively.

Cash flow hedges:

The Company uses derivatives to moderate the financial and commodity
market risks of its business operations. Derivative products, such as futures
and option contracts, are considered to be a hedge against changes in the
amount of future cash flows related to commodities procurement. The Company
also enters into interest rate swap agreements to adjust the proportion of
total long-term debt and leveraged equipment loans that are subject to variable
interest rates. Under these interest rate swaps, the Company agrees to pay a
fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount and to receive in
return an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same
notional principal amount. These interest rate swaps are considered to be a
hedge against changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with the
Company's variable rate interest payments.

The effective portion of the cumulative gain or loss
on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive
income (loss) in shareholders' equity and recognized into earnings in the same
period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings (for
commodity hedges when the chickens that consumed the hedged grain are sold). 
The remaining cumulative gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of
the cumulative change in the present value of the future cash flows of the
hedged item, if any, is recognized in earnings during the period of change.  No
ineffectiveness was recognized on cash flow hedges during fiscal 2003, 2002 or 2001. The
Company expects that the after tax losses, net of gains, totaling approximately
$6 million recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) at September 27, 2003,
related to cash flow hedges, will be recognized within the next 12 months. The
Company generally does not hedge cash flows related to commodities beyond 12
months.

Fair value hedges:

The Company designates certain
futures contracts as fair value hedges of firm commitments to purchase livestock
for slaughter and natural gas for the operation of its plants.  From time to
time, the Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge
changes in fair value of receivables and purchase commitments arising from
changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies; however, the Company has
not entered into any such contracts in fiscal years 2003 or 2002.  Changes in
the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that is designated
and qualifies as a fair value hedge, along with the loss or gain on the hedged
asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or
gains on firm commitments), are recorded in current period earnings. 
Ineffectiveness results when the change in the fair value of the hedge instrument
differs from the change in fair value of the hedged item.  Ineffectiveness
recorded related to the Company's fair value hedges was not significant during
fiscal 2003, 2002 or 2001.

Undesignated positions:

The Company holds certain commodity futures contracts in the regular course of
business to manage its exposure against commodity price fluctuations on
anticipated purchases of raw materials and anticipated sales of finished
inventories. The contracts are generally for short durations of less than one
year. Although these instruments are economic hedges, the Company does not
designate these contracts as hedges for accounting


purposes. As a result, the Company marks these contracts to market and
recognizes the change through earnings.  At September 27, 2003, these
contracts had a fair value of $14 million recorded as assets on the consolidated
balance sheet.  At September 28, 2002, these contracts had a fair value
liability of $11 million recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.

Fair values are based on quoted

September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002.

Concentrations of Credit Risk:

The Company's financial instruments
that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash
equivalents and trade receivables.  The Company's cash equivalents are in high
quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. 
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to
the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. 
The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers' financial
condition and generally does not require collateral.  At September 27, 2003,
approximately 10.3% of the Company's net accounts receivable balance was due
from one customer.  No other customer or customer group represents greater than
10% of net accounts receivable.

NOTE 7: PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

The major categories of property, plant and equipment
and accumulated depreciation at cost, at September 27, 2003, and September 28,

NOTE 9: COMMITMENTS

The Company leases certain farms and other properties
and equipment for which the total rentals thereon approximated $104 million in
2003, $105 million in 2002 and $76 million in 2001. Most farm leases have terms
ranging from one to 10 years with varying renewal periods. The most significant
obligations assumed under the terms of the leases are the upkeep of the
facilities and payments of insurance and property taxes.

Minimum lease commitments under non-cancelable leases
at September 27, 2003, total $164 million composed of $61 million for fiscal 2004,
$36 million for fiscal 2005, $30 million for fiscal 2006, $21 million for fiscal
2007, $11 million for fiscal 2008 and $5 million for later years.

The Company guarantees debt of outside third parties,
which involve letters of credit, a lease and grower loans, all of which are
substantially collateralized by the underlying assets.  Terms of the underlying
debt range from one to 12 years and the maximum potential amount of future
payments as of September 27, 2003, was $68 million.  The Company also maintains
operating leases for various types of equipment, some of which contain residual
value guarantees for the market value for assets at the end of the term of the
lease.  The terms of the lease maturities range from one to six years.  The
maximum potential amount of the residual value guarantees is approximately $104
million, of which approximately $31 million would be recoverable through
various recourse provisions and an undeterminable recoverable amount based on
the fair market value of the underlying leased assets.  The likelihood of
payments under these guarantees is not considered probable.

The Company enters into various future purchase
commitments for finished live cattle and hogs at a market-derived price.  These
future purchase commitments include risk sharing and procurement arrangements
with certain producers that help secure a supply of livestock.  The commitments
deliverable in any year are less than the operating requirements of that year.

NOTE 10: LONG-TERM DEBT

The Company has unsecured revolving credit facilities
totaling $1 billion that support the Company's commercial paper program,
letters of credit and other short-term funding needs.  These facilities consist
of $200 million that expires in June 2004, $300 million that expires in June
2005 and $500 million that expires in September 2006.  At September 27, 2003,
and September 28, 2002, there were no amounts drawn under the revolving credit
facilities.

The Company has a receivables purchase agreement with
three co-purchasers to sell up to $750 million of trade receivables that
consists of $375 million expiring in August 2004 and $375 million expiring in
August 2005.  The receivables purchase agreement has been accounted for as a
borrowing and has an interest rate based on commercial paper issued by the
co-purchasers.  Under this agreement, substantially all of the Company's
accounts receivable are sold to a special purpose entity, Tyson Receivables
Corporation (TRC), which is a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of the
Company.  TRC has its own separate creditors that are entitled to be satisfied
out of all of the assets of TRC prior to any value becoming available to the
Company as TRC's equity holder.  At September 29, 2003, and September 28, 2002,
there was $0 and $75 million outstanding under the receivables purchase
agreement, respectively.


At September 27, 2003, the Company had outstanding
letters of credit totaling approximately $294 million issued primarily in
support of workers' compensation insurance programs, industrial revenue bonds
and leveraged equipment loans.  There were no draw downs under these letters of
credit at September 27, 2003.

Under the terms of the leveraged equipment loans, the
Company had cash deposits totaling approximately $54 million, which is included
in other assets at September 27, 2003. Under these leveraged loan agreements,
the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively lock in a
fixed interest rate for these borrowings.

Annual maturities of long-term debt for the five fiscal
years subsequent to September 27, 2003, are: 2004-$490 million; 2005-$185
million; 2006-$295 million; 2007-$899 million and 2008-$16 million.

The revolving credit facilities, senior notes, notes
and accounts receivable securitization contain various covenants, the more
restrictive of which contain a maximum allowed leverage ratio and a minimum
required interest coverage ratio.  The Company is in compliance with these
covenants at fiscal year end.

Industrial revenue bonds are secured by facilities
with a net book value of $159 million at September 27, 2003. The weighted
average interest rate on all outstanding short-term borrowing was 1.5% at
September 27, 2003, and 3.3% at September 28, 2002.

NOTE 11: COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)

The components of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) include: foreign currency translation adjustment of $(2) million,
$(23) million and $(16) million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively;
unrealized hedging gains (losses), net of taxes, of $(9) million, $(18)
million and $(21) for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively; unrealized gain
(loss) on investments, net of taxes, of $1, $0 and $2 million for 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively; and minimum pension liability adjustment, net of taxes,
of $(5) million and $(8) million for 2003 and 2002, respectively.

NOTE 12: STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK

The shareholders approved the Tyson Foods, Inc. 2000
Stock Incentive Plan (Incentive Plan) in January 2001. The Incentive Plan is
administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and
permits awards of shares of Class A stock, awards of derivative securities
related to the value of Class A stock and tax reimbursement payments to
eligible persons. The Incentive Plan provides for the award of a variety of
equity-based incentives such as incentive stock options, nonqualified stock
options, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, performance
unit awards and phantom shares. The Incentive Plan provides for granting
incentive stock options for shares of Class A stock at a price not less than
the fair market value at the date of grant. Nonqualified stock options may be
granted at a price equal to, less than or more than the fair market value of
Class A stock on the date that the option is granted.  Stock options under the
Incentive Plan generally become exercisable ratably over three to eight years
from the date of grant and must be exercised within 10 years from the date of
grant.

In May 2000, the Company cancelled approximately
four million option shares and granted approximately one million restricted
shares of Class A stock. The restriction expires over periods through December
1, 2003. At September 27, 2003, the Company had outstanding approximately nine
million restricted shares


of Class A stock with restrictions expiring over
periods through July 1, 2020. The unearned portion of the restricted stock is
classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as unamortized deferred
compensation in shareholders' equity.  The Company issues restricted stock
at the market value as of the date of grant.  The weighted average fair
value of restricted stock granted was $11.20 per share during 2003 $9.52 per
share during 2002.

A summary of the Company's stock option activity is as

The weighted average fair value of options granted
during 2003 was approximately $4.32. The fair value of each option grant is established
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Assumptions
include an expected life of six years, risk-free interest rate ranging from
2.56% to 3.30%, expected volatility ranging from 38.2% to 40.1% and dividend
yield ranging from 1.20% to 1.72% in 2003


NOTE 13: BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has defined contribution retirement and
incentive benefit programs for various groups of Company personnel. Company
contributions totaled $48 million, $50 million and $35 million in 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively.

NOTE 14: TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

The Company has operating leases for farms, equipment
and other facilities with the former Senior Chairman of the Board of Directors
of the Company and certain members of his family, as well as a trust controlled
by him, for rentals of $8 million in 2003, $9 million in 2002 and $9 million in
2001. Other facilities have been leased from other officers and directors for
rentals totaling $2 million in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001.

An entity owned by a former director that resigned
from the Board of Directors during 2003 received from the sale of cattle to a
subsidiary of the Company $10 million in 2003, $10 million in 2002 and $5
million in 2001.

Certain officers and directors are engaged in chicken
and swine growout operations with the Company whereby these individuals
purchase animals, feed, housing and other items to raise the animals to market
weight. The total value of these transactions, which were discontinued during
fiscal 2003, amounted to $10 million in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001.

for deferred income taxes which provides that deferred tax liabilities are
recorded at current tax rates based on the difference between the tax basis of
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting
purposes referred to as temporary differences.

Net deferred tax liabilities are included in other

The deferred tax liability for suspended taxes
from conversion

to accrual method represents the 1987 change from
the cash to accrual method of accounting and will be paid down by 2017, subject
to income limitations.

The valuation allowance totaling $49 million consists
of $13 million state tax carryforwards, which have been fully reserved, and $36
million for net operating loss carryforwards.  The state tax credit
carryforwards expire in the years 2004 through 2008.  At September 27, 2003,
after considering utilization restrictions, the Company's acquired tax loss
carryforwards approximated $192 million. The net operating loss carryforwards,
which are subject to utilization limitations due to ownership changes, may be
utilized to offset future taxable income subject to limitations. These
carryforwards expire during the years 2004 through 2022.

The Company's cash payments for income taxes were $36
million, $90 million and $54 million in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Approximately 8 million, 6 million and 10 million of the
Company's option shares outstanding at September 27, 2003, September 28, 2002,
and September 29, 2001, respectively, were antidilutive and were not included
in the dilutive earnings per share calculation.  On September 28, 2001, the
Company issued approximately 129 million shares for the remaining IBP shares.
These shares were excluded from the fiscal 2001 weighted average share
calculation along with the dilutive effect of acquired stock options and
restricted shares.

NOTE 17: SEGMENT REPORTING

The Company operates in five business segments: Chicken,
Beef, Pork, Prepared Foods and Other. The
Company measures segment profit as operating income.  The following
information includes 52 weeks of IBP's operating results for the periods ending
September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, and nine weeks for the period
ending September 29, 2001.

Chicken segment

value-added chicken products sold through domestic foodservice, domestic food
retailers, wholesale club markets that service small foodservice operations,
small businesses and individuals, as well as specialty and commodity
distributors who deliver to restaurants, schools and international markets
throughout the world. The Chicken segment also includes sales from allied
products and the chicken breeding stock subsidiary.

Beef segment

is primarily involved in the
processing of live fed cattle and fabrication of dressed beef carcasses into
primal and sub-primal meat cuts and case-ready products. It also involves
deriving value from allied products such as hides and variety meats for sale to
further processors and others. The Beef segment markets its products to food
retailers, distributors, wholesalers, restaurants, hotel chains and other
food processors in domestic and international markets. Allied products are also
marketed to manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and technical products.

Pork segment

is primarily involved in the processing of live market hogs and fabrication of
pork carcasses into primal and sub-primal cuts and case-ready products.  This
segment also represents the Company's live swine group and related allied
product processing activities. The Pork segment markets its products to food
retailers, distributors, wholesalers, restaurants, hotel chains and other
food processors in domestic and international markets. It also sells allied
products to pharmaceutical and technical products manufacturers, as well as
live swine to pork processors.

Prepared Foods

segment

includes the Company's operations that manufacture and market
frozen and refrigerated food products.  Products include pepperoni, beef and
pork toppings, pizza crusts, flour and corn tortilla products, appetizers, hors
d'oeuvres, desserts, prepared meals, ethnic foods, soups, sauces, side dishes,
specialty pasta and meat dishes as well as branded and processed meats.  The

The majority of the Company's operations are domiciled
in the United States.  Approximately 95%, 94% and 97% of sales to external
customers for fiscal years ending 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, were
sourced from the United States.  Approximately $6.5 billion of long-lived
assets were located in the United States at fiscal years ending 2003 and 2002,
and $6.6 billion at fiscal year ending 2001.  Approximately $185 million, $193
million and $204 million of long-lived assets were located in foreign

Russia, Taiwan and South Korea.  The Company's export sales for 2003, 2002 and
2001 totaled $2.6 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. 
Substantially all of the Company's export sales are facilitated through
unaffiliated brokers, marketing associations and foreign sales staffs.  Foreign
sales, which are sales of products produced in a country other than the United
States, were less than 10% of total consolidated sales for 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.  Approximately 15%, 11% and 15% for 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, of income before taxes were from foreign operations.

NOTE 19: CONTINGENCIES

Listed below are certain claims made against the
Company and its subsidiaries.  In the Company's opinion, it has made
appropriate and adequate reserves and accruals where necessary and the Company
believes the probability of a material loss beyond the amounts accrued to be
remote; however, the ultimate liability for these matters is uncertain, and if
accruals and reserves are not adequate, an adverse outcome could have a
material effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of
operations of the Company.  The Company believes it has substantial defenses to
the claims made and intends to vigorously defend these cases.

Wage and Hour/ Labor Matters

In 2000, the Wage and Hour Division of the
U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) conducted an industry-wide investigation of
poultry producers, including the Company, to ascertain compliance with various
wage and hour issues.  As part of this investigation, the DOL inspected 14 of
the Company's processing facilities.  On May 9, 2002, the Secretary of Labor
filed a civil complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Alabama.  The complaint alleges that the Company violated
the overtime provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) at the
Company's chicken-processing facility in Blountsville, Alabama.  The complaint
does not contain a definite statement of what acts constituted alleged
violations of the statute.  The Secretary of Labor seeks unspecified back wages
for all employees at the Blountsville facility for a period of two years prior
to the date of the filing of the Complaint, an additional amount in unspecified
liquidated damages, and an injunction against future violations at that
facility and all other facilities operated by the Company.  The Company has
filed its initial answer and discovery has commenced.


On June 22, 1999, 11 current and former employees of
the Company filed the case of

M.H. Fox, et al. v. Tyson

Foods, Inc.
(Fox v. Tyson)

in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Alabama claiming the Company violated requirements of the FLSA.  The suit
alleges the Company failed to pay employees for all hours worked and/or
improperly paid them for overtime hours. The suit specifically alleges that (1)
employees should be paid for time taken to put on and take off certain working
supplies at the beginning and end of their shifts and breaks and (2) the use of
"mastercard" or "line" time fails to pay employees for all
time actually worked. Plaintiffs seek to represent themselves and all similarly
situated current and former employees of the Company, and plaintiffs seek
reimbursement for an unspecified amount of unpaid wages, liquidated damages,
attorney fees and costs.  At filing, 159 current and/or former employees
consented to join the lawsuit and, to date, approximately 5,000 consents have
been filed with the court. Discovery in this case is ongoing. A hearing was
held on March 6, 2000, to consider the plaintiff's request for collective
action certification and court-supervised notice. No decision has been
rendered.

On August 22, 2000, seven employees of the Company
filed the case of

De Asencio v. Tyson Foods, Inc.

in the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. This lawsuit is similar to

Fox
v. Tyson

in that the employees claim violations of the FLSA for allegedly
failing to pay for time taken to put on, take off and sanitize certain working
supplies, and violations of the Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law. 
Plaintiffs seek to represent themselves and all similarly situated current and
former employees of the poultry processing plant in New Holland, Pennsylvania,
and plaintiffs seek reimbursement for an unspecified amount of unpaid wages,
liquidated damages, attorney fees and costs. Currently, there are approximately
500 additional current or former employees who have filed consents to join the
lawsuit. The court, on January 30, 2001, ordered that notice of the lawsuit be
issued to all potential plaintiffs at the New Holland facilities.  On July 17,
2002, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion to certify the state law
claims.  On September 23, 2002, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to
hear the Company's petition to review the court's decision to certify the state
law claims.   On September 8, 2003, the Court of Appeals reversed the district
court's certification of a class under the Pennsylvania Wage Payment & Collection
Law, ruling that those claims could not be pursued in federal court.  The
appellate court further ruled that the Company must reissue notice of their
potential FLSA claims to approximately 1,500 employees who did not previously
receive notice.  The Court of Appeals remanded the matter to the district court
to proceed accordingly on September 30, 2003.

Substantially similar suits have been filed against
several other integrated poultry companies. In addition, organizing activity
conducted by representatives or affiliates of the United Food and Commercial
Workers Union against the poultry industry has encouraged worker participation
in

Fox v. Tyson

and the other lawsuits.

On November 5, 2001, a lawsuit entitled

Maria
Chavez, et al. vs. IBP, Lasso Acquisition Corporation and

Tyson Foods,
Inc.

(Chavez)

was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Washington against IBP, inc. (IBP; now known as Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc.) and
the Company by several employees of IBP's Pasco, Washington, beef slaughter and
processing facility alleging various violations of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. Sections
201 - 219, as well as violations of the Washington State Minimum Wage Act, RCW
chapter 49.46, Industrial Welfare Act, RCW chapter 49.12, and the Wage
Deductions-Contribution-Rebates Act, RCW chapter 49.52. The

Chavez

lawsuit alleges IBP and/or the Company required employees to perform unpaid
work related to the donning and doffing of certain personal protective
clothing, both prior to and after their shifts, as well as during meal periods.
Plaintiffs further allege that similar prior litigation entitled

Alvarez, et
al. vs. IBP (Alvarez),

which resulted in a $3.1 million final judgment against IBP,
supports a claim of collateral estoppel and/or is res judicata as to the issues
raised in this new litigation.  Plaintiffs are seeking reimbursement for an
unspecified amount of damages, exemplary damages, liquidated damages,
prejudgment interest, attorney fees and costs.  IBP filed a timely Notice of
Appeal in

Alvarez

and plaintiffs filed a timely notice of Cross-Appeal. 
On August 5, 2003, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the lower
court's decision in part and reversed the lower court's decision in part, and
remanded the case to the lower court for recalculation of damages.  If the
ruling of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is upheld in its entirety, IBP
will have additional exposure in

Alvarez

of approximately $5 million. 
IBP filed a petition for rehearing by the panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals that heard

Alvarez

or, in the alternative, a rehearing en banc,
and it also filed a petition to certify state law claims to the Washington
Supreme Court.  On September 23, 2003, the Court denied the petition for
certification.  The petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc is pending
before the Court.

Chavez

initially was pursued as an opt-in, collective
action under 29 U.S.C. 216(b), but the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Washington granted  plaintiff's  motion seeking certification of a
class of opt-out, state law plaintiffs under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23
and notice has been sent to potential


state law claim class members.  A trial
date of September 7, 2004 in

Chavez

has been set by the court.

On
November 21, 2002, a lawsuit entitled

Emily
D. Jordan, et al. v. IBP, Inc. and Tyson Foods, Inc

., was filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.  Ten current and former hourly
employees of IBP's case-ready facility in Goodlettsville, Tennessee filed a
complaint on behalf of themselves and other unspecified, allegedly
"similarly situated" employees, claiming that the defendants have
violated the overtime provisions of the FLSA.  The suit alleges that the
defendants have failed to pay employees for all hours worked from the plant's
commencement of operations under IBP's control in April 2001.  The Company
acquired the plant as part of its acquisition of IBP.  In particular, the suit
alleges that employees should be paid for the time it takes to collect,
assemble, and put on, take off and wash their health, safety, and production
gear at the beginning and end of their shifts and during their meal period. 
The suit also alleges that the defendants deduct 30 minutes per day from
employees' paycheck regardless of whether employees obtain a full 30-minute
period for their meal.  Plaintiffs are seeking a declaration that the
defendants did not comply with the FLSA, and an award for an unspecified amount
of back pay compensation and benefits, unpaid entitlements, liquidated damages,
prejudgment and post-judgment interest, attorney fees and costs.  On January
10, 2003, another 31 employees from Tennessee filed consents to join the
lawsuit as plaintiffs.  On January 15, 2003, the defendants filed an answer to
the complaint denying any liability. On January 14, 2003, the named plaintiffs
filed a motion for expedited court-supervised notice to prospective class
members.   The motion  sought to conditionally certify a class of similarly
situated employees at all of IBP's non-unionized facilities that have not been
the subject of FLSA litigation.  Plaintiffs then withdrew a request for
conditional certification of similarly situated employees at all of IBP's
non-unionized facilities and rather sought to include all non-exempt employees
that have worked at the Goodlettsville facility since its opening on April 1,
2001.  On November 17, 2003, the district court conditionally certified a
collective action composed of similarly situated current and former employees
at the Goodlettsville facility based upon clothes changing and washing
activities and unpaid production work during meal periods, since the plant
operations began in April 2001. The parties are, under the supervision of the
court, specifying the terms and conditions of the notice.  An initial case
management conference is scheduled for January 8, 2004.

Environmental Matters

On October 23, 2001, a putative class action
lawsuit was filed in the District Court for Mayes County, Oklahoma, against the
Company by R. Lynn Thompson and Deborah S. Thompson on behalf of all owners of
Grand Lake O' the Cherokee's littoral (lake front) property. The suit alleges
that the Company "or entities over which it has operational control"
conduct operations in such a way as to interfere with the putative class action
plaintiffs' use and enjoyment of their property, allegedly caused by diminished
water quality in the lake.  Plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief and an
unspecified amount of compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorney fees and
costs.  Simmons Foods, Inc. ("Simmons") and Peterson Farms, Inc. have been
joined as defendants.  The Company and Simmons are seeking leave to file a
third party complaint against entities that contribute wastes and wastewater
into Grand Lake. The class certification hearing  was held in October 2003,
and two classes were certified on December 11, 2003.  The defendants are in
the process of filing an interlocutory appeal of the class certification..

Securities Matters

Between January and March 2001, a number of lawsuits were filed
by certain stockholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of South
Dakota and one suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of New York seeking to certify a class of all persons who purchased IBP stock
between February 7, 2000, and January 25, 2001.  The plaintiff in the New York
action voluntarily dismissed and refiled its complaint in South Dakota, where
the suits were consolidated under the name

In re IBP, inc. Securities
Litigation

and a single, consolidated amended complaint was filed.

The
complaint, seeking unspecified compensatory damages, alleges that IBP and
certain members of management violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and claims IBP
issued materially false statements about IBP's financial results in order to
inflate its stock price.  IBP filed a Motion to Dismiss on December 21, 2001,
which was then fully briefed.  While the motion was awaiting decision, IBP and
the plaintiffs reached a tentative settlement of all claims, as reflected by a
Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") that was executed on March 19, 2003.  The
MOU set forth the essential terms of a settlement to be reflected in final
settlement documents to be prepared and submitted to the court for approval,
including, among other terms and conditions, the dismissal with prejudice of
all claims against defendants, releases by class members, and a payment by IBP
of a total amount of $8 million. In July 2003, a finalized Stipulation of
Settlement consistent with the MOU was executed and submitted to the court for
its preliminary approval. The tentative settlement is subject to various
conditions, including among other things, execution of definitive documentation
and receiving preliminary and final court approvals.  In light of this
tentative settlement, IBP was permitted by the court to withdraw its pending
motion to dismiss,


without prejudice.  On July 31, 2003, the court issued an order
preliminarily approving the settlement, preliminarily certifying a Settlement
Class of all persons who purchased IBP common stock during the period from
February 7, 2000, through January 25, 2001, and approving proposed notice to the
Settlement Class members.  The court also set December 8, 2003 as the date
for a hearing as to whether the settlement should receive final court approval. 
The Company does not anticipate that effectuation of the tentative settlement
will have any material impact on its financial condition, especially in view of
IBP's insurance coverage for the matter.

Between June 22 and July 20, 2001, various plaintiffs
commenced actions (the Delaware Federal Actions) against the Company, Don
Tyson, John Tyson and Les Baledge in the U.S. District Court for the District
of Delaware, seeking monetary damages on behalf of a purported class of those
who sold IBP stock or traded in certain IBP options from March 29, 2001, when
the Company announced its intention to terminate the Merger Agreement with IBP,
through June 15, 2001, when the Delaware Court rendered its Post-Trial Opinion
in the Consolidated Action. The actions, entitled

Meyer v. Tyson Foods,
Inc., et al.

, C.A. No. 01-425 SLR;

Banyan Equity Mgt. v. Tyson

Foods,
Inc., et al.,

C.A. No. 01-426 GMS;

C.A. No. 01-496; and

Stark
Investments, L.P., et al. v. Tyson et al

., C.A. No. 01-565 alleged that the
defendants violated federal securities laws by making, or causing to be made,
certain false and misleading statements in connection with the Company's
attempted termination of the Merger Agreement.  Plaintiffs are seeking an
unspecified amount of compensatory damages, interest, attorney fees and costs. 
The various actions were subsequently consolidated under the caption

In re
Tyson Foods, Inc. Securities Litigation.

On December 4, 2001, the
plaintiffs in the consolidated action filed a Consolidated Class Action
Complaint.  The plaintiffs allege that, as a result of the defendants' alleged
conduct, the purported class members were harmed.  On January 22, 2002, the
defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint.  By memorandum
order dated October 23, 2002, the court granted in part and denied in part the
defendants' motion to dismiss.   On October 6, 2003, the court certified the
class proposed by plaintiffs.  Factual discovery in the case is in the process
of concluding.

General Matters

In July 1996, certain cattle producers filed

Henry Lee Pickett, et al. vs.
IBP, inc.

in the U.S. District Court, Middle District of Alabama,
seeking certification of a class of all cattle producers. The complaint alleged
that IBP used its market power and alleged "captive supply"
agreements to reduce the prices paid by IBP on purchases of cattle in the
cash market in alleged violation of the Packers and Stockyards Act
("PSA").  Plaintiffs are seeking injunctive and declaratory
relief, as well as actual and punitive damages. After Plaintiffs
failed a number of times to get a class certified, the District Court in
December 2001 certified a class of cattle producers who have sold to IBP
exclusively on a cash market basis from approximately 1994 to
2002.  IBP sought permission to appeal the class certification to the
11th Circuit Court of Appeals, but the Court of Appeals denied that appeal
on March 5, 2002.  IBP's motions for summary judgment on both liability
and damages were denied on April 29, 2003.  On November 19, 2003, the
District Court judge upheld the admissibility of an amended Plaintiffs' expert
report which calculates total class damages, exclusive of pre-judgment
interest, in excess of $2.1 billion.  Management believes IBP's use of
marketing agreements and other contracts for the purchase of cattle do not
violate the PSA and that IBP has acted properly and lawfully in its dealings
with cattle producers.  The case is set for trial on January 12, 2004.

On September 12, 2002, 82 individual plaintiffs filed

Michael
Archer, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. and The Pork Group, Inc.

, CIV 2002-497,
in the Circuit Court of Pope County, Arkansas.  On August 18, 2002, the Company
announced a restructuring of its live swine operations which, among other
things, will result in the discontinuance of relationships with 132 contract
hog producers, including the plaintiffs.  In their complaint, the plaintiffs
allege that the Company committed fraud and should be promissorily estopped from
terminating the parties' relationship.  The plaintiffs seek an unspecified
amount of compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorney fees and costs. 
The Company has filed a motion to Stay All Proceedings and Compel Arbitration
which was denied, and briefing has begun in the Arkansas Court of Appeals. 
Oral argument has not yet been set

The Company is pursuing various antitrust claims
relating to vitamins, methionine and choline.  In partial settlement of these
claims, the Company received approximately $167 million in 2003.  Additional
settlements of much lesser amounts are anticipated in fiscal 2004.  Amounts
received for these claims are recorded as income only upon receipt of
settlement proceeds.
