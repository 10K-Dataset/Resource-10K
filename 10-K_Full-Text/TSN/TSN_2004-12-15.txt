ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

Tyson Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, "the
Company" or "Tyson"), with world headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas, produce,
distribute and market chicken, beef, pork, prepared foods and related allied
products.  The Company commenced business in 1935, was incorporated in Arkansas
in 1947, and was reincorporated in Delaware in 1986.  The Company has engaged
in a number of acquisitions, including the acquisitions of IBP, inc. (now called
Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc. (TFM)) in 2001, Hudson Foods, Inc. in 1998 and Holly
Farms Corporation in 1989.  In addition to being the world's largest processor
and marketer of chicken, beef and pork products, the Company is also the second
largest publicly traded food company in the United States and has one of the
most recognized brand names in the food industry.

The Company operates a totally integrated poultry production
process.  Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Cobb-Vantress, Tyson is the
number one breeding stock supplier in the world.  Tyson invests in breeding
stock research and development which allows the Company to breed into its
flocks the natural characteristics found to be most desirable.  The Company's
integrated operations consist of breeding and raising chickens, as well as the
processing, further-processing and marketing of these food products and related
allied products, including animal and pet food ingredients.

The Company is also involved in the processing of live
fed cattle and hogs and fabrication of dressed beef and pork carcasses into
primal and sub-primal meat cuts, case-ready products and fully-cooked beef and
pork products.  In addition, the Company derives value from allied products
such as hides and variety meats for sale to further processors.

The Company produces a wide range of fresh,
value-added, frozen and refrigerated food products.  The Company's products are
marketed and sold to national and regional grocery retailers, regional grocery
wholesalers, meat distributors, clubs and warehouse stores, military
commissaries, industrial food processing companies, national and regional chain
restaurants or their distributors, international export companies and domestic
distributors who service restaurants, foodservice operations such as plant and
school cafeterias, convenience stores, hospitals and other vendors.  Sales are
made by the Company's sales staff primarily located in Springdale, Arkansas,
and Dakota Dunes, South Dakota.  Additionally, sales to the military and a
portion of sales to international markets are made through independent brokers
and trading companies.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS

The Company operates in five business segments:
Chicken, Beef, Pork, Prepared Foods and Other.  The contribution of each
business segment to net sales and operating income, and the identifiable assets
attributable to each business segment are set forth in Note 20, "Segment
Reporting" of the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein at pages 63
through 64.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Chicken

The Company's chicken operations primarily are involved in the processing of
live chickens into fresh, frozen and value-added chicken products.  The Chicken
segment markets its products domestically to food retailers, foodservice
distributors, restaurant operators and noncommercial foodservice establishments
such as schools, hotel chains, healthcare facilities, the military and other
food processors, as well as to international markets throughout the world.  The
Chicken segment also includes sales from allied products and the chicken
breeding stock subsidiary.

Beef

The Company's beef operations primarily are involved in the processing of live fed cattle and fabrication of dressed beef
carcasses into primal and sub-primal meat cuts and case-ready products.  It
also involves deriving value from allied products such as hides and variety
meats for sale to further processors and others.  The Beef segment
markets its products domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors,
restaurant operators and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as
schools, hotel chains, healthcare facilities, the military and other food
processors, as well as to international markets throughout the world.  Allied products are also marketed to
manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and technical products.

Eight of the Company's fed beef plants include hide processing
facilities.  The uncured hides from the Company's other fed beef plants are
transported to these facilities, which include brine curing operations and, in
four locations, chrome hide tanneries.  The chrome tanning process produces
a semi-finished product that is shipped to leather good manufacturers worldwide. 
Brine-cured hides are sold to other tanneries.  Tyson is the largest chrome
tanner of cattle hides in the United



States.

Pork

The
Company's pork operations involve the processing of live market hogs and
fabrication of pork carcasses into primal and sub-primal cuts and case-ready
products.  This segment also represents the Company's live swine group and
related allied product processing activities. The Pork segment markets its
products domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors, restaurant
operators and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, hotel
chains, healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well
as to international markets throughout the world.  It also sells allied
products to pharmaceutical and technical products manufacturers, as well as
live swine to pork processors.

Additionally, the Company has farrow-to-finish swine
operations, which include genetic and nutritional research, weaned and feeder
pig sales, feeder pig finishing and the marketing of live swine to regional and
national packers that are conducted in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma.

Prepared Foods

The Company's prepared foods operations manufacture and market frozen and
refrigerated food products.  Products include pepperoni, beef and pork
toppings, pizza crusts, flour and corn tortilla products, appetizers, prepared
meals, ethnic foods, soups, sauces, side dishes and meat dishes, as well as
branded and processed meats.  The Prepared Foods segment markets its products
domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors, restaurant operators
and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, hotel chains,
healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well as to
international markets throughout the world.

Other

The
Company's Other segment includes the logistics group and other corporate
activities not identified with specific protein groups.

RAW MATERIALS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY

Chicken

The primary raw materials used by the Company in its chicken operations consist
of live chickens that are raised primarily by independent contract growers.  The
Company's vertically-integrated chicken process begins with the grandparent
breeder flocks.  Breeder farms specialize in producing the generations of male
and female strains, with the broiler being the final progeny.  The breeder
flocks are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where
fertile eggs are produced.  The fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent
hatchery and produce male and female pullets (i.e., the parents).  The pullets are
sent to breeder houses, and the resulting eggs are sent to Company hatcheries.  Once
the chicks have hatched, they are sent to broiler farms.  There, contract
growers care for and raise the chicks according to Company standards while
receiving advice from Company technical service personnel until the broilers have
reached the desired processing weight.  The adult chickens are caught and
hauled to processing plants. The finished products are sent to distribution
centers and then transported to customers.  The Company operates its own feed
mills to produce scientifically-formulated feeds.  Corn and soybean meal are
major production costs in the poultry industry, representing roughly 44% of the
cost of growing a chicken.  In addition to feed ingredients to grow the
chickens, the Company uses cooking ingredients, packaging materials and
cryogenic agents.  The Company believes that its sources of supply for these
materials are adequate for its present needs and the Company does not
anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future.  While
the Company produces substantially all of its inventory of breeder chickens and
live broilers, it from time-to-time purchases live, ice-packed or deboned
chicken to meet production requirements.

Beef

The primary raw material used by the Company in its beef operations is live
cattle.  The Company does not have facilities of its own to raise cattle in the
United States.  The Company has approximately 60 cattle buyers located
throughout cattle producing areas that visit feed yards and buy live cattle on
the open spot market.  These buyers are trained to select high quality animals
and their performance is continually measured by the Company.  The Company also
enters into various risk-sharing and procurement arrangements with producers
that help secure a supply of livestock for daily start-up operations at its
facilities.  The Company's Canadian subsidiary, Lakeside Farm Industries LTD
(Lakeside), primarily has cattle feeding facilities and a beef carcass production
and boxed beef processing facility.  In 2004, Lakeside's feedlots provided
approximately 15% of that facility's fed cattle needs.

Pork

The primary raw material used by the Company in its pork operations is live
swine.  The Company raises live swine to sell to outside processors and supplies
a minimal amount of live swine for its own processing needs.  The majority of
the Company's live swine supply is obtained through various procurement
arrangements with producers.  The Company also employs buyers who purchase hogs
on a daily basis, generally a few days before the animals are required for
processing.



Prepared Foods

The primary raw materials used by the Company in its prepared foods operations
are typically commodity based raw materials, including fresh and frozen chicken,
beef and pork, corn, flour and frozen vegetables.  Some of these raw materials
are provided by the Chicken, Beef and Pork segments and can also be purchased
from numerous suppliers and manufacturers.

SEASONAL DEMAND

The demand for the Company's chicken and beef products
generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases
during the winter months. The Company's pork and prepared foods products generally
experience increased demand during the winter months due to the holiday season
and decreased demand during the spring and summer months.

CUSTOMERS

The Company had one customer that accounted for more
than 10% of consolidated sales in fiscal 2004, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounted
for approximately 12% of the Company's fiscal 2004 consolidated sales.  Sales
to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. were included in the Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared
Foods segments.  Any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could,
if not replaced, have a material impact on the Company's operations; however,
the Company does not anticipate any such occurrences due to the demand for its
products.

BACKLOG OF ORDERS

As of October 2, 2004, there was no significant
backlog of unfilled orders for the Company's products.

COMPETITION

The Company's food products compete with those of
other national and regional food producers and processors and certain prepared
food manufacturers, including Cargill Incorporated, Foster Farms, Gold Kist,
Inc., Hormel Foods Corporation, Kraft Foods, Inc., Perdue Farms Inc., Pilgrim's
Pride Corp., Sanderson Farms Inc., Sara Lee Corporation, Smithfield Foods Inc.,
and Swift and Company.  Additionally, the Company's food products compete in
international markets around the world.  The Company's principal marketing and
competitive strategy is to identify target markets for value-added products, to
concentrate production, sales and marketing efforts in order to appeal to and
enhance the demand from those markets and, utilizing its national distribution
systems and customer support services, seek to achieve a leading market
position for its products.  Past efforts have indicated that customer demand
generally can be increased and sustained through application of the Company's
marketing strategy, as supported by its distribution systems.  The principal
competitive elements are brand identification, breadth and depth of the product
offering, product quality, customer service and price.

INTERNATIONAL

The Company exported to more than 80 foreign countries
in fiscal 2004. Major export markets include Canada, China, European Union,
Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Russia, Taiwan and South Korea.

The Company continues to explore growth opportunities
in Brazil, Canada, China and Mexico and believes each offers potential in terms of
expanding or developing
processing facilities.  The Company's subsidiary in Mexico continues to show
growth with a focus on further processed chicken products.  The Company's
Canadian subsidiary, Lakeside, has cattle feeding facilities and a beef carcass
production and boxed beef processing facility.  The Company's wholly owned
subsidiary, Cobb-Vantress, has operations in Argentina, Brazil, India,
Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Poland, Spain, the
United Kingdom, Venezuela and the Netherlands.  The Company also owns a majority
interest in and operates a chicken further processing facility in China.  The
Company has minority interests in a Chinese pork processing facility and a Canadian chicken further processing
facility, and a 50% interest in a Chinese casing operation.  The Company
continues to be involved in a technical service agreement with Grupo Melo in
Panama to assist Grupo Melo with the production of further processed chicken products and to allow it to license the Tyson brand. 
Additional information regarding the Company's export sales, long-lived assets
located in foreign markets and income from foreign operations is set forth in
Note 20, "Segment Reporting" of the Consolidated Financial Statements included
herein at pages 63 through 64.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The Company conducts continuous research and
development activities to improve finished product development, to develop ways
to automate manual processes in its processing plants and growout operations
and to improve the strains of primary chicken breeding stock.  The annual cost
of such research and development programs is less than one percent of total
consolidated annual sales.



REGULATION AND FOOD SAFETY

The Company's facilities for processing chicken, beef,
pork, prepared foods, milling feed and for housing live chicken and swine are
subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws relating to the
protection of the environment, including provisions relating to the discharge
of materials into the environment, and to the health and safety of its employees. 
The Company's chicken, beef and pork processing facilities are participants in
the government's Hazardous Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) program and
are subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and
Response Act of 2002.  The cost of compliance with such laws and regulations
has not had a material adverse effect upon the Company's capital expenditures,
earnings or competitive position and it is not anticipated to have a material
adverse effect in the future.  In 2004, the Company incurred expenses of
approximately $98 million to maintain compliance with such regulations.  These
expenditures relate principally to the normal operation and maintenance of
wastewater treatment facilities (Wastewater Treatment Facilities),
where the Company biologically treats these wastes, and the associated land
application of wastes generated at these treatment facilities.  The Company incurred $4 million in capital expenditures,
related to its Wastewater Treatment Facilities, in fiscal 2004 and anticipates
capital expenditures of approximately $5 million in fiscal 2005 for environmental
projects related to the Wastewater Treatment Facilities.  The Company believes
that it is in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations
and the Company is not aware of any violations of, or pending changes in, such
laws and regulations that are likely to result in material penalties or
material increases in compliance costs, except as disclosed in Item 3.

The Company works to ensure its products meet high
standards of food quality and safety.   The Company's chicken, beef, pork and
prepared foods products are subject to inspection prior to distribution,
primarily by the United States Department of Agriculture and the United States
Food and Drug Administration.  Notwithstanding these
efforts, food producers are at risk that their products may contain pathogens.

The Company is exposed to risk if its products are
determined to be contaminated or cause illness or injury.   These risks include
(1) the cost of adverse publicity and product recalls, including the associated
negative consumer reaction; (2) exposure to related civil litigation; and (3)
regulatory administrative penalties, which can include injunctive relief and
other civil remedies, including plant closings.

EMPLOYEES AND LABOR RELATIONS

As of October 2, 2004, the Company employed
approximately 114,000 team members. The Company believes that its overall relations
with its workforce are good.

Set forth below is a listing of the Company facilities
which have employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement together with

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

The Company's principal marketing objective is to be
the primary provider of chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods products for our
customers.  The Company identifies distinct markets and business opportunities
through continuous consumer and market research.  The Company's branding
strategy focuses on one national protein brand, the Tyson brand, as well as a
number of strong regional brands.  The Company has de-emphasized some of its
prepared foods brand names and replaced them with the Tyson Brand.  All
communications stress the quality, convenience and protein power benefits of
our products while supporting and building brand awareness.  Communications
efforts are built around the "Powered by Tyson" strategy and utilize a fully
integrated and coordinated mix of activities designed to connect with customers
and consumers on both a rational and emotional level. The Company utilizes its
national distribution system and customer support services to achieve the
leading market position for its products.

The Company has the ability to produce and ship fresh,
frozen and refrigerated products.  The Company's nationwide distribution system
extends to a broad network of food distributors which is supported by cold
storage warehouses owned or leased by the Company, by public cold storage
facilities and by the Company's transportation system.  The Company ships
products from Company-owned consolidated frozen food distribution centers, from
a network of public cold storages, from other owned and leased facilities and
directly from plants.  The Company's distribution centers facilitate
accumulating fresh and frozen products so that it can fill and consolidate
less-than-truckload orders into full truckloads, thereby decreasing shipping
costs while increasing customer service. In addition, customers are provided
with a wide selection of products that do not require large volume orders.  The
Company's distribution system enables it to supply large or small quantities of
products to meet customer requirements anywhere in the continental United
States.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

The Company has registered a number of patents and trademarks
relating to its processes and products which either have been approved or are in the process
of application. Because the Company does a significant amount of brand name and
product line advertising to promote its products, it considers the protection
of such trademarks to be important to its marketing efforts.  The Company has
also developed non-public proprietary information regarding its production
processes and other product-related matters.  The Company utilizes internal procedures
and safeguards to protect the confidentiality of such information, and where
appropriate, seeks patent protection for the technology it utilizes.

INDUSTRY PRACTICES

The Company's agreements with its customers are
generally short-term, due primarily to the nature of its products, industry
practice and the fluctuation in demand and price for such products.  In certain
instances where the Company is selling further processed products to large
customers, the Company may enter into written agreements whereby the Company
will act as the exclusive or preferred supplier to the customer for periods up
to five years and on pricing terms which are either fixed or variable.

AVAILABILITY OF SEC FILINGS AND CORPORATE GOVERANCE
DOCUMENTS ON INTERNET WEBSITE

The Company maintains an internet website for
investors at http://ir.tysonfoodsinc.com.

The Company makes available
free of charge on this website annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports
on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to any of

investors are the Company's corporate governance principles, Audit Committee
charter, Compensation Committee charter, Governance Committee charter and code
of conduct.   The Company's corporate governance documents are available in

and 20 ground pet food processing operations in connection with chicken
processing plants capable of producing 10 million pounds of product per week.  In
addition, there are two blending mill operations, 38 feed mills and 63 broiler
hatcheries with sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the chicken growout
operations.  During 2004, the feed mills operated at 78% of capacity, the
hatcheries operated at 91% of capacity and the processing plants operated at 95%
capacity.

Beef

The Company's beef operations consist of 14 beef production facilities, four of
which include case-ready operations, and a Canadian cattle feedlot.  These
plants are devoted to various phases of slaughtering live cattle, fabricating beef
products and some treat and tan hides.  One of the beef facilities contains a
tallow refinery and two of the case-ready operations share facilities with the Pork
segment.  The carcass facilities reduce live cattle to dressed carcass form. 
The processing facilities conduct fabricating operations to produce boxed beef
and allied products.  The slaughtering processes operated in 2004 at
approximately 74% of their capacities.  The total slaughter capacity is
approximately 240,000 head per week.

Pork

The Company's pork operations consist of eight pork production facilities, two
of which include case-ready operations.  These plants are devoted to various
phases of slaughtering live hogs and fabricating pork products and allied
products.  The two case-ready operations share facilities with the Beef
segment.  The processing facilities operated in 2004 at approximately 85% of
their production capacities.  The total slaughter capacity of these facilities
is approximately 434,000 head per week.  Additionally the Company's live swine
operations have 47 farrowing barns, 92 nursery houses, 77 finishing houses and two
boar facilities.  The Company also utilizes live swine contract growers.  The
swine growout operations are supported by one dedicated feed mill supplemented by
production from the chicken operations' feed mills.

Prepared Foods

The Company's prepared foods operations consist of 30 processing plants which
process fresh and frozen beef, pork, chicken and other raw materials into pizza
toppings, branded and processed meats, appetizers, prepared meals, ethnic
foods, soups, sauces, side dishes and pizza crusts, flour and corn tortilla
products and meat dishes.  These processing plants have the capacity to produce
approximately 58 million pounds per week and operated in 2004 at approximately 76%
of capacity.

Other

The Company's other operations consist of 11 distribution centers, as well as 11
cold storage facilities used by the beef and pork divisions, 44 cold storage
facilities at chicken processing plants, three cold storage facilities at
chicken rendering plants and four cold storage facilities used by prepared
foods plants with a total capacity of approximately 306 million pounds.

The Company owns its major operating facilities with
the following exceptions: one chicken emulsified plant is leased month to
month, one hatchery is leased month to month, 387 chicken breeder farm houses
are leased under agreements expiring at various dates through 2009, 31 chicken
breeder farm houses are leased month to month and 30 broiler farms are leased
year to year.  Additionally, the Company's live swine operation leases 24 farrowing
barns, 20 nursery houses and 46 finishing houses, expiring at various dates
through 2009.  One prepared foods distribution center is leased month to month
and two prepared foods further processing facilities are leased until fiscal
year 2005.

Management believes the Company's present facilities
are generally adequate and suitable for its current purposes; however, seasonal
fluctuations in inventories and production may occur as a reaction to market
demands for certain products.  The Company regularly engages in construction
and other capital improvement projects intended to expand capacity and improve
the efficiency of its processing and support facilities.



ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Refer to the discussion of
certain legal proceedings pending against the Company under Part II., Item 8,
Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, Note 22: Contingencies,
which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.  Listed below are certain
additional legal proceedings involving the Company and its subsidiaries.

In January 1997, the State of Illinois Attorney
General brought suit in the Circuit Court for the 14

th

Judicial
Circuit, Rock Island, Illinois, Chancery Division against TFM alleging that
TFM's operations at its Joslin, Illinois, facility are violating the "odor
nuisance" statutory provisions enacted in the State of Illinois. TFM has
completed improvements at its Joslin facility to reduce odors from this
operation, but denies the Illinois Attorney General's contention that its
operations at any time amounted to a "nuisance." The Illinois Attorney General
has alleged a damage claim ranging from approximately $1,800,000 to
$2,700,000.  In May 2003, the State of Illinois attempted to add the Company as
a defendant in the suit, which the court subsequently denied.  In September
2003, the State of Illinois served the Company with a complaint that had been
filed in the Circuit Court for the 14

th

Judicial Circuit, Rock
Island County, Illinois Chancery Division alleging substantially the same
causes of action against the Company as had been alleged in the action against
TFM. On May 27, 2004, TFM and the State of Illinois Attorney General entered
into a Preliminary Injunction Order to investigate and address the alleged
"nuisance" issues. Damage claims will be addressed after completion of the
Preliminary Injunction Order. At the same time, the State of Illinois Attorney
General filed an Agreed Order of Dismissal regarding the September 2003 suit
against the Company.

In May 2004, TFM met with U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) staff regarding alleged wastewater and late report
filing violations under the Clean Water Act relating to the 2002 Second and
Final Consent Decree that governed compliance requirements for TFM's Dakota
City, Nebraska facility.  During that meeting, TFM was verbally informed of USEPA's
intent to potentially assess stipulated penalties for those alleged violations,
with a maximum penalty figure of approximately $338,000.  No formal written
demand for stipulated penalties pursuant to the Consent Decree has been
presented at this time.  TFM vigorously disputes these allegations.  Additional
discussions with USEPA regarding a potential settlement of this matter are
expected.

On February 25, 2004 the Indiana Department of
Environmental Management (IDEM) issued a Notice of Violation to the Company's
facility in Portland, Indiana for alleged violations of Clean Air Act permitting
regulations. During a meeting held in April 2004, IDEM requested an
administrative penalty of approximately $195,000. The Company vigorously
disputes these allegations, but has entered into preliminary discussions with
IDEM regarding a potential settlement of this matter.

In June 2001, TFM was
advised the SEC had commenced a formal investigation related to the restatement
of earnings made by TFM in March 2001, including matters relating to certain
improprieties in the financial statements of DFG, a wholly-owned subsidiary. 
TFM is cooperating with this investigation.  On July 27, 2004, the SEC filed a
Complaint for Permanent Injunction and Other Equitable Relief against three
former employees of DFG.  One of the former employees, Philip J. Sexauer, has
entered into a Consent Judgment with the SEC.  On August 23, 2004, staff of the
SEC advised TFM that no enforcement action against TFM had been recommended by
the staff to the SEC.

In March 2004, the Company was advised that the SEC had commenced
a formal, non-public investigation concerning the Company's disclosures of
executive perquisites.  In August 2004, the Company announced that it had
received notice that the staff of the SEC intended to recommend that the SEC
bring a civil enforcement action against the Company and that it was considering
seeking a monetary penalty.  The notice alleged that the Company's proxy
statements for fiscal years 1997 through 2003 had failed to comply with SEC
regulations with respect to the disclosure and description of perquisites
totaling approximately $1.7 million provided to Don Tyson, former Senior
Chairman of the Company, and that the Company had failed to maintain an adequate
system of internal controls regarding the personal use of Company assets and the
disclosure of perquisites and personal benefits.  The SEC staff also advised the
Company it was considering recommending that the SEC bring administrative
cease-and-desist actions against two Company non-executive employees for
allegedly causing these failures.  In addition, Don Tyson received notice the
staff intended to recommend that the SEC bring a similar civil enforcement
action against him.  The Company was subsequently advised that the SEC
staff had withdrawn its proposed recommendations with respect to the two
employees, and that it intended to recommend that the SEC seek monetary penalties against the
Company and Don Tyson.

In December 2004,
following discussions with the staff regarding resolution of this matter, the
Company and Don Tyson proposed that the Company, without admitting or denying
wrongdoing, would pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million and



consent to the
entry of an administrative cease and desist order and that Don Tyson, also
without admitting or denying wrongdoing, would pay a civil penalty of $200,000
and consent to the entry of an administrative cease and desist order.  These
settlement proposals are subject to mutual agreement on the language of the
order.  The SEC staff has agreed to recommend both of these offers of settlement
to the SEC.  The proposed settlements and the proposed order are subject to
final approval by the SEC.

In February 2002, the Company learned that a
processing facility owned by Zemco Industries, Inc., a subsidiary of TFM, is
the subject of an investigation by the U.S. Attorney's office in Bangor, Maine,
into allegedly improper testing and recording practices.  The Company acquired Zemco
as part of the Company's acquisition of TFM on September 28, 2001.  A former Zemco
employee at the processing facility has pled guilty to charges in connection
with the investigation.  To date there has been no claim by the U.S. Attorney
against Zemco, and Zemco will continue to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's
office.

In August 2004, the Company received a subpoena requesting the
production of documents from a federal grand jury sitting in the Western
District of Arkansas.  The subpoena focused on events surrounding a
workplace accident that resulted in the death of an employee at the River Valley
Animal Foods rendering plant in Texarkana, Arkansas on October 10, 2003. 
That workplace fatality had previously been the subject of an investigation by
the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) of
the Department of Labor.  On April 9, 2004, OSHA issued citations to Tyson
Foods, Inc. and Tyson Poultry, Inc., d/b/a River Valley Animal Foods, alleging
violations of health and safety standards arising from the death of the
employee due to hydrogen sulfide inhalation.  The citations consist of five
willful, twelve serious, and two recordkeeping violations.  OSHA seeks
abatement of the alleged violations and proposed penalties of $436,000.  The
OSHA proceeding was stayed pending the completion of the grand jury
investigation.  Since the receipt of the document subpoena, a number of company
employees have provided grand jury testimony or informal interviews to
government investigators.  Federal officials have not yet indicated whether
they intend to pursue any action against the Company in connection with this
investigation.

In July
2002, three cattle producers (Herman Schumacher, Michael P. Callicrate, and
Roger D. Koch) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of
South Dakota, naming as defendants the Company and three other beef packers. 
Since then, TFM has been substituted for the Company as the party defendant. 
Plaintiffs claim that in 2001, during the first six weeks that the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) began its mandatory price reporting program,
defendants knowingly used the inaccurate boxed beef cutout prices (cutout
prices are determined by the USDA through a formula that averages the prices of
the various box beef cuts reported by all packers) calculated and published by
USDA to negotiate the purchase of fed cattle from plaintiffs at prices
substantially lower than would have been economically justified had plaintiffs
known the accurate higher cutout prices.  Plaintiffs contend that defendants'
conduct constituted an unfair or deceptive practice in violation of the Packers
and Stockyards Act (PSA), 7 U.S.C. §192.  Plaintiffs also seek damages under
state law unjust enrichment principles.  Plaintiffs submitted an affidavit from
their expert on April 1, 2004, which maintained class damages were in the
"tens of millions" of dollars.  On June 4, 2004, the District Court
certified a class to pursue the PSA claims, consisting of "all persons or
business associations that owned any interest in cattle that were intended for
slaughter and who sold or permitted the sale of such cattle (excluding culled
dairy and beef cows and bulls) to defendants on the open spot cash cattle
market, or on a basis affected by that market, between April 2, 2001, to and
including May 11, 2001."  Other classes were certified in connection with the
state law unjust enrichment claims.  On June 22, 2004, defendants sought leave
from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals to appeal the class certification
ruling.  This request was denied on July 7, 2004.  During the period in
question, TFM correctly reported beef sales information to the USDA.

Tyson and other poultry integrators have been advised
by the Attorney General of Oklahoma that the State of Oklahoma intends to
commence water quality litigation related to alleged nutrient loading in
certain Oklahoma watersheds.  Specifically, the suit would presumably seek
damages and injunctive relief based upon the alleged impact of excess nutrients
associated with the land application of poultry litter by the companies and
contract growers.   The Companies are presently attempting to negotiate a
comprehensive settlement with the Attorney General of Oklahoma.

Other Matters

The Company has approximately 114,000 team members and at any time has various
employment practices matters.  In the aggregate, these matters are significant
to the Company and the Company devotes significant resources to handling
employment issues.  Additionally, the Company is subject to other lawsuits,
investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial amounts) arising
out of the conduct of its business.  While the ultimate results of these
matters cannot be determined, they are not expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial
position.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

Tyson Foods is the world's largest protein company and
the second largest publicly traded food company in the

Fortune

500 with
one of the most recognized brand names in the food industry.  Tyson produces,
distributes and markets chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods and related allied
products.  The Company's primary operations are conducted in four segments: 
Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods.  Some of the key factors that influence
the Company's business are customer demand for the Company's products, the
ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and
innovative products to the marketplace, accessibility of international markets,
market prices for the Company's chicken, beef and pork products, the cost of
live cattle and hogs, raw materials and grain and operating efficiencies of the
Company's facilities.

In August 2004,
the Company introduced a new marketing and communication campaign "Powered
by Tyson." This is the largest fully integrated marketing campaign in
Tyson history and is supported by an investment of $75 million from the Company's
annual marketing budget. To support the Company's goals of building its value-added
product portfolio, Tyson developed 400 new products this year. Additionally,
the Company broke ground at its Corporate Center for the construction of
facilities that will house expanded product development kitchens, a new pilot
production plant, provide space for the consumer insights group and make
provisions for team member development activities.

In fiscal 2004, the Company achieved record sales and
earnings, driven largely by the strong performance of the Company's Chicken and
Pork segments.  The Company continued to generate strong cash flow in fiscal
2004, as cash flow from operations increased $112 million from the prior year. 
This allowed the Company to pay down debt by $242 million in fiscal 2004, and
exceed the debt-to-capital ratio goal of 45% by reaching 44% at year end. 
Earnings for fiscal 2004 were $403 million, or $1.13 per diluted share,
compared to $337 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, in fiscal 2003.  The
increase in earnings primarily was due to higher average selling prices,
improved operating efficiencies in the Chicken segment, increased demand in the
Chicken and Pork segments and improvements to the mix of our value-added
products.    Earnings were negatively impacted by higher grain costs, partially
offset by the Company's on-going commodity risk management activities, higher
raw material costs and the continued limited access to export markets.  Also,
fiscal 2004 pretax earnings included $40 million of costs, or $0.07 per diluted
share, related to plant closings, $61 million of costs, or $0.11 per diluted
share, of BSE-related charges, $21 million of costs, or $0.04 per diluted
share, related to fixed asset write-downs and $25 million of costs, or $0.04
per diluted share, related to the impairment of various intangible assets. 
Fiscal 2003 pretax earnings included $167 million received in connection with
vitamin antitrust litigation, $76 million of costs related to plant closings
and $10 million of charges related to the impairment of an equity interest in a
live swine operation.

The Company's accounting cycle resulted in a 53-week
year for fiscal year 2004, and a 52-week year for fiscal years 2003 and 2002.

Outlook

The Company's goals for fiscal 2005 are to reduce the
debt-to-capital ratio to 40%, improve the mix of value-added products to over
40% of sales and improve the return on invested capital to 14%.  Additionally,
the Company anticipates expenses related to interest, foreign exchange and
other charges to be approximately $250 million and the effective tax rate to be in the
range of 36% to 37%.

Although uncertainty in global market conditions continues to
make it difficult to predict future product demand, the Company believes the
Chicken, Pork and Prepared Foods segments will be strong in fiscal 2005;
however, the Beef segment operations will continue to be difficult.  The
Company anticipates stronger export demand for chicken in fiscal 2005 due to the
recent openings of the China and Japan markets, the liberalization of the
Taiwanese market and the continuing emergence of the middle-eastern and African
markets.  The Canadian border continues to be closed for live cattle;
however, the U.S. government has recently initiated a review process to re-open
the Canadian border.  Also, while there is a framework of an agreement for
the resumption of trade with Japan, it appears trade will not resume for several
months.  Currently live weights of cattle being slaughtered are
considerably higher than last year, indicating supplies of



cattle in the near term will be more abundant; however, until
international market access is restored and live cattle are permitted from
Canada, margins in the Beef segment will be negatively impacted.

2004 vs. 2003

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior
periods to conform to current presentations.

Sales

increased $1.9 billion or 7.7%, with a 9.4% increase in average price and a
1.5% decrease in volume.  The increase in sales primarily is due to higher
average selling prices.  Volumes declined due to a reduction in international
export activity related to the Chicken and Beef segments resulting from import
restrictions imposed by various countries.  Additionally, the Company's Beef
segment domestic volumes decreased due to tightened supply of live cattle, the
effects of higher beef pricing and significant competing protein supplies in
the marketplace.

Cost of sales

increased $1.7 billion or 7.7%.  As a percent of sales, cost of sales decreased
from 92.9% to 92.8%.  The increase in cost of sales is due primarily to increases
in grain costs in the Chicken segment, which were partially offset by gains
resulting from the Company's on-going commodity risk management activities
related to grain purchases, and in the Beef segment, higher live cattle prices
and BSE-related charges.  Also included in 2004 cost of sales were $18 million
to reduce self insurance reserves to the actuarially determined range.  The
reserves are compared to actuarial estimates semi-annually.  The prior year had
a $6 million reduction in self insurance reserves.  Additionally, fiscal 2003
cost of sales included $167 million received in connection with vitamin
antitrust litigation.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

increased $49 million or 5.9%.  As a percent of
sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 3.4% to
3.3%.  The increase in expenses primarily was due to an increase in personnel
and incentive-based compensation of approximately $40 million, an increase of
approximately $20 million related to information system technology improvements,
an increase of approximately $21 million in employee benefit costs, primarily
due to prior year actuarial gains of $13 million related to certain retiree
medical benefit plans and current year increases in healthcare-related costs.  The
increases were partially offset by a reduction in auditing, legal and
professional fees of approximately $27 million, which included $12 million
received in fiscal 2004 related to legal settlements from the Company's
insurance providers.

Other charges

include plant closing costs of $40 million and $76 million recorded in fiscal
years 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Fiscal 2004 costs were related primarily to
the closings of the Company's Jackson, Mississippi, Manchester, New Hampshire
and Augusta, Maine, facilities.  As part of its on-going plant rationalization
efforts, the Company announced in February 2004 its decision to consolidate its
manufacturing operations in Jackson, Mississippi, into the Company's Carthage,
Mississippi, facility.  The Company acquired the Carthage facility when it
purchased Choctaw Maid Farms in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and, since
that time, performed a comprehensive analysis of all operations in the area and
determined this consolidation would most effectively maintain the Company's
competitiveness in its Mississippi operations. In December 2003, the Company
announced its decision to close its Manchester, New Hampshire, and Augusta,
Maine, Prepared Foods operations to further improve long-term manufacturing
efficiencies.  After thorough analysis, the Company determined that the amount
of capital required to bring the Manchester and Augusta facilities to a
competitive level and to maintain appropriate food safety standards, would be
better spent to accommodate production in newer more modern facilities. The
majority of the Manchester and Augusta production was consolidated into other
Company facilities. The prior year costs were related to the closings of the
Company's Berlin, Maryland, Stilwell, Oklahoma and Jacksonville, Florida,
facilities.  Also included in other charges for fiscal 2004 were $25 million in
charges related to the impairment of various intangible assets and $21 million
related to fixed asset write-downs. The impairment charges apply primarily to
trademarks acquired in the acquisition of Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc. (TFM;
formerly known as IBP, inc.) in 2001.  These impairment charges resulted
primarily from lower product sales under some of the Company's regional
trademarks as products are increasingly being sold under the Tyson trademark.
The fair value of the Company's trademarks is determined using a royalty rate
method based on expected revenues by trademark. The trademarks, as well as all
other intangible assets, are reviewed at least annually for impairment. The
fixed asset write-down was the result of the Company implementing a control
whereby all plant facilities conduct fixed asset inventories on a recurring
basis.

Interest expense

decreased $21 million or 7.1%, primarily resulting from an 8.2%
decrease in the Company's average indebtedness.  The Company incurred $13
million of expenses in each fiscal year of 2004 and 2003, related to the
on-going efforts to buy back bonds at attractive prices when available in the
market and to the early redemption of Tyson de Mexico preferred shares.  The
overall weighted average borrowing rate increased to 7.7% from 7.4%, primarily
due to the fiscal 2004 reduction of short-term debt which carried lower
interest rates.



Other expense

decreased
$3 million from the same period last year, primarily resulting from the $10 million
write-down related to the impairment of an equity interest in a live swine
operation recorded in fiscal 2003.  This decrease was partially offset by
increased foreign exchange losses of approximately $9 million from the
Company's Canadian operation in fiscal 2004.

The effective tax rate

increased from 35.5% in fiscal 2003 to 36.6% in
fiscal 2004.  The estimated Extraterritorial Income Exclusion (ETI) amount
reduced the 2004 effective tax rate by 0.5% compared to 1.9% in fiscal 2003. 
The decrease in the 2004 estimated ETI benefit resulted from a reduction in the
estimated 2004 profit from export sales primarily due to the effects of BSE and
avian influenza, along with an adjustment to the estimated 2003 benefit.  The
2004 estimated rate also increased due to the expiration of certain general
business credits.  On October 22, 2004, the President signed into law the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 which provides, among other things, for the
repeal of the ETI benefit phased in from 2004 through 2006.  The Act also
provided for a domestic production deduction which will be available to the
Company beginning in the 2006 fiscal year.   The Company is currently in the
process of evaluating the Act.

Segment Information

Tyson operates in five business segments: Chicken,
Beef, Pork, Prepared Foods and Other.  The Company measures segment profit as
operating income.

Chicken segment

is involved primarily in the processing of live chickens into fresh, frozen and
value-added chicken products. The Chicken segment markets its products
domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors, restaurant operators
and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, hotel chains,
healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well as to international
markets throughout the world.  The Chicken segment also includes sales from
allied products and the chicken breeding stock subsidiary.

Beef segment

is involved primarily in the
processing of live fed cattle and fabrication of dressed beef carcasses into
primal and sub-primal meat cuts and case-ready products.  It also involves
deriving value from allied products such as hides and variety meats for sale to
further processors and others.   The Beef
segment markets its products domestically to food retailers, foodservice
distributors, restaurant operators and noncommercial foodservice establishments
such as schools, hotel chains, healthcare facilities, the military and other
food processors, as well as to international markets throughout the world.  Allied products are also marketed to
manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and technical products.

Pork segment

is involved primarily in the processing of live market hogs and fabrication of
pork carcasses into primal and sub-primal meat cuts and case-ready products. 
This segment also represents the Company's live swine group and related allied
product processing activities.   The Pork segment markets its products
domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors, restaurant operators
and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, hotel chains,
healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well as to
international markets throughout the world.  It also sells allied products to
pharmaceutical and technical products manufacturers, as well as live swine to
pork producers.

Prepared Foods segment

includes the Company's operations that manufacture and market
frozen and refrigerated food products.  Products include pepperoni, beef and
pork toppings, pizza crusts, flour and corn tortilla products, appetizers,
prepared meals, ethnic foods, soups, sauces, side dishes and meat dishes, as
well as branded and processed meats.  The Prepared Foods segment markets its
products domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors, restaurant
operators and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, hotel
chains, healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well
as to international markets throughout the world.

Other segment

includes the logistics group and other corporate activities not identified with
specific protein groups.



Chicken segment

sales increased 13.1% in fiscal 2004 as compared to the same period
last year.  Foodservice chicken sales
increased 11.3%, retail chicken sales increased 16.2% and international chicken
sales increased 14.5%.  Excluding plant
closing related accruals of $13 million and $76 million recorded in fiscal 2004
and 2003, respectively, and fixed asset write-downs of $13 million recorded in
fiscal 2004, operating income increased $340 million.  Sales and operating
income increases primarily are due to increased average selling prices and
sales volumes, as well as improvements in product mix and operating
efficiencies.  Operating income was negatively impacted by approximately $239
million of increased grain costs, partially offset by a benefit of
approximately $127 million from the Company's on-going commodity risk
management activities related to grain purchases.  The increase in the
Company's domestic Chicken segment sales volumes in fiscal 2004 was partially
offset by decreased international sales volumes due to import restrictions by
various countries caused by the avian influenza outbreaks in the United States.

Beef segment

sales increased 0.1% in fiscal 2004 as compared to the same period last year.  Domestic fresh meat beef sales increased 6.0%,
international beef sales decreased 31.6% and case-ready beef sales increased 18.0%.
 Operating income for fiscal 2004
includes BSE-related charges of $61 million and $5 million of charges related
to the impairment of various intangible assets and fixed asset write-downs. 
Additionally, operating income was negatively impacted by increases in live
cattle prices, production declines and decreased capacity utilization.  These
decreases were partially offset by higher average selling prices and increased
volumes and margins at the Company's Lakeside operation in Canada.

Pork segment

sales increased 28.9% in fiscal 2004 as
compared to the same period last year.  Domestic fresh meat pork sales
increased 26.1%, international pork sales increased 60.2%, case-ready pork
sales increased 29.4% and live swine sales of Company owned hogs decreased 14.8%. 
The increase in the Pork segment's operating
income primarily was due to higher average selling prices and increased demand as
pork benefited from stronger domestic and international markets, more than
offsetting increases in live hog costs.  Operating income was negatively
impacted by approximately $1 million related to fixed asset write-downs
recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.

Prepared Foods segment

sales increased
7.3% in fiscal 2004 as compared to the same period last year. Foodservice
prepared foods sales increased 13.2%, international prepared foods sales
increased 16.0% and retail prepared foods sales increased 0.5%.  Fiscal 2004 operating
income increased $25 million, excluding
plant closing costs of approximately $27 million, the impairment of various
intangible assets of $22 million and fixed asset write-downs of $5 million, all
of which were recorded in fiscal 2004. The increase in the Prepared Foods
segment's operating income primarily was due to higher average selling prices
and increased volumes, partially offset by increased raw material prices.

Other segment

operating income
decreased $145 million primarily due to settlements of $167 million received in
2003 in



connection with vitamin antitrust litigation.  Additionally in 2003,
operating income was affected positively by actuarial gains of $13 million
resulting from certain retiree medical benefit plans.

2003 vs. 2002

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior
periods to conform to current presentations.

Sales

increased $1.2 billion or 5.1%, with a slight increase in volume and a 5.0%
increase in price.

Cost of sales

increased $1.3 billion or 5.8%.  As a percent of sales, cost of sales was 92.9%
for 2003 compared to 92.2% for 2002.  This increase primarily is due to higher
live cattle prices in the Beef segment, increases in grain costs in the Chicken
segment and increased accruals related to on-going litigation, partially offset
by $167 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

decreased $46 million or 5.4%.  As a percent of
sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 3.8% to
3.4%.  The decrease primarily is due to the expense reductions of approximately
$42 million related to the sale of Specialty Brands, Inc. in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2002, and approximately $16 million associated with the integration
of Tyson and Tyson Fresh Meats corporate functions.  Additional decreases were
due to favorable investment returns of approximately $18 million on Company owned
life insurance, actuarial gains of $13 million related to certain retiree
medical benefit plans and decreased litigation costs of approximately $19
million resulting primarily from the reversal of certain legal accruals which
are no longer required due to cases being closed.  The decreases in selling,
general and administrative expenses were partially offset by increased
professional fees of approximately $26 million, primarily related to the
Company's on-going integration and strategic initiatives, and increased sales
promotions and marketing costs of approximately $45 million, primarily due to
the introduction and rollout of several new products.

Other charges

include $76 million of plant closing costs incurred in fiscal 2003, and $53
million of charges incurred in fiscal 2002 related to the discontinuation of
the Thomas E. Wilson brand and the restructuring of the Company's live swine
operations.

Interest expense

decreased $9 million or 2.8% compared to 2002, primarily resulting
from an 8.2% decrease in the Company's average indebtedness.  As a percent of
sales, interest expense was 1.2% compared to 1.3% for 2002.  The overall
weighted average borrowing rate increased to 7.4% from 7.0%, primarily
resulting from premiums paid on bonds repurchased in the first and fourth
quarters of fiscal 2003.  Excluding the premiums paid, interest expense
decreased $21 million.

Other expense

increased
$29 million, primarily resulting from the $10 million write-down related to the
impairment of an equity interest in a live swine operation recorded in fiscal
2003, and the gain of $22 million from the sale of the Specialty Brands, Inc.
subsidiary recorded in fiscal 2002.

The effective tax rate

was 35.5% in both 2003 and
2002.  Several factors impacted the effective tax rate including average state
income tax rates, the tax rates for international operations and the
Extraterritorial Income Exclusion (ETI) for foreign sales. Taxes on
international earnings were comparable for 2003 and 2002. Average state taxes
added 2.2% and 3.0% to the effective tax rate for 2003 compared to 2002, and
ETI reduced the effective rate by 1.9% in 2003 compared to a 1.4% reduction in
2002.



Chicken segment

sales increased 2.8% compared to fiscal 2002. Foodservice chicken sales increased 4.2%, retail
chicken sales increased 2.3% and international chicken sales decreased 3.6%.  Excluding plant closing costs of $76 million recorded
in fiscal 2003, operating income decreased $194 million. This decrease results
primarily from higher grain costs as compared to fiscal 2002.

Beef segment

sales increased 13.8% compared to fiscal 2002.  Domestic fresh meat beef sales increased 11.8%, international beef
sales increased 19.4% and case-ready beef sales increased 20.4%.  Beef segment operating income increased $100 million. 
The Beef segment sales and operating income increases were caused by strong
demand during the second half of fiscal 2003 caused in part by the U.S. ban on
Canadian beef.  However, these increases were partially offset by an increase
in live cattle prices.

Pork segment

sales decreased 1.3% compared to fiscal 2002. Domestic fresh meat pork sales decreased 3.5%, international pork sales
increased 2.8%, case-ready pork sales increased 52.3% and live swine sales
decreased 42.6%.  Excluding the fourth
quarter 2002 live swine restructuring charge of $26 million, operating income
increased $24 million.  The decline in sales primarily is due to a reduction in
live swine sales as a result of the fiscal 2002 live swine restructuring and
lower average selling prices for our finished product.  Operating income was
positively affected by the restructuring of the live swine operation, partially
offset by higher live hog prices.

Prepared Foods segment

sales decreased 13.4% compared to fiscal 2002. 
Excluding fiscal 2002 Specialty Brands, Inc. sales of $244 million, segment
sales decreased $166 million and 5.9% and volume declined slightly.  Segment
operating income decreased $128 million excluding the Thomas E. Wilson brand
write-down of $27 million recorded in fiscal 2002.  This decrease results
primarily from the increases in raw material prices, lower average selling
prices, increased costs related to the introduction of more than 75 new
products in fiscal 2003 and temporary operating inefficiencies at certain
plants.

Other segment

operating income increased $171
million primarily due to settlements received in connection with vitamin
antitrust litigation.  Fiscal 2003 operating income includes $167 million as
compared to $30 million received in fiscal 2002.  Additionally, operating
income was positively affected by actuarial gains recorded in fiscal 2003 of
$13 million resulting from certain retiree medical benefit plans.

ACQUISITIONS

In September 2003, the
Company purchased Choctaw Maid Farms, Inc. (Choctaw), an integrated poultry
processor.  Since 1992, Tyson had been purchasing all of Choctaw's production
under a "cost plus" supply agreement, which was scheduled to expire in 2007. 
The Company had previously negotiated a purchase option with Choctaw's owners,
which initially became exercisable in 2002.  The Company decided to exercise
its purchase option rather than continue under the "cost plus" arrangement of the
supply agreement.  The acquisition was recorded as a purchase in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business
Combinations" (SFAS No. 141).  Accordingly, the assets and liabilities were
adjusted for fair values with the remainder of the purchase price, $18 million,
recorded as goodwill. The purchase price consisted of $1 million cash to
exercise the purchase option in Tyson's supply agreement with Choctaw and the
settlement of $85 million owed to Tyson by Choctaw. In addition, the Company
assumed approximately $4 million of Choctaw's debt to a third party.  In June
2003, the Company exercised a $74 million purchase option to acquire assets
leased from a third party which the Company had subleased to Choctaw.  Pro
forma operating results reflecting the acquisition of Choctaw would not be
materially different from the Company's actual results of operations.



In May 2002, the Company acquired the assets of
Millard Processing Services, a bacon processing operation, for approximately
$73 million in cash. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, and
goodwill of approximately $14 million was recorded.

DISPOSITION

In September 2002, the Company completed the sale of
its Specialty Brands, Inc. subsidiary.  The subsidiary had been acquired with
the TFM acquisition, and its results of operations were included in the
Company's Prepared Foods segment.  The Company received cash proceeds of
approximately $131 million, which were used to reduce indebtedness, and
recognized a pretax gain of $22 million.  Specialty Brands, Inc.'s sales and
operating income for the year ended September 28, 2002, were $244 million and
$2 million, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash provided by operations continues to be the
Company's primary source of funds to finance operating requirements and capital
expenditures. In 2004, net cash of $932 million was provided by operating
activities, up $112 million from 2003.  The increase from fiscal 2003 primarily
is due to the increase of $98 million from net income, excluding the non-cash
effect of depreciation and amortization.  The Company's foreseeable cash needs
for operations growth and capital expenditures are expected to continue to be
met through cash flows provided by operating activities.  Additionally, at October
2, 2004, the Company had borrowing capacity of $1.1 billion consisting of $640
million available under its $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities
and $450 million under its accounts receivable securitization.  At October 2,
2004, the Company had construction projects in progress that will require
approximately $492 million to complete.  Capital spending for fiscal 2005 is
expected to be in the range of $600 to $680 million, which reflects additional
spending for a third fully dedicated case-ready plant, a new Corporate Center and
a variety of projects that will increase automation and support value-added
product growth.  The Company continues to evaluate potential international and
domestic growth opportunities.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company restructured and extended
its revolving credit facilities.  These $1 billion in facilities now consist of
$250 million that expire in September 2006 and $750 million that expire in June
2009. At October 2, 2004, there were no borrowings outstanding under these
facilities. Outstanding debt at October 2, 2004, consisted of $2.8 billion of
debt securities, $300 million under the receivables purchase agreement, $86
million of commercial paper and other indebtedness of $160 million.

residual guarantee amounts.

(5)        Amounts included in purchase
obligations are agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable
and legally binding on the Company that specifies all significant terms,
including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or
variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. 
Included in the purchase obligations amount are future purchase commitments for
corn, soybeans, livestock and natural gas contracts that provide terms that
meet the above criteria.  The Company has excluded future purchase commitments
for contracts that do not meet these criteria.   Purchase orders have not been
included in the table, as a purchase order is an authorization to purchase and
is not considered an enforceable and legally binding contract.  Contracts for
goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also
been excluded.

(6)        Amounts included in capital expenditures
are estimated amounts to complete construction projects in progress as of
October 2, 2004.

(7)        Amounts included in other long-term
liabilities are items that meet the definition of a purchase obligation and are
recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS

In December
2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 151, "Inventory Costs" (SFAS No.
151).  SFAS No. 151 requires abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to
idle facility, freight handling and wasted material expenses to be recognized
as current period charges.  Additionally, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation
of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal
capacity of the production facilities.  The standard is effective for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005.  The Company believes the adoption of SFAS
No. 151 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.

On October 22, 2004, the
President signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Bill). 
The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the Bill.

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-6, "Participating Securities and the
Two-Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share."  This issue
involves the computation of earnings per share for companies that have multiple
classes of common stock or have issued securities other than common stock that
participate in dividends with common stock (participating securities).  The
EITF concluded that companies



having participating securities are required to
apply the two-class method to compute earnings per share.  The two-class method
is an earnings allocation method under which earnings per share is calculated
for each class of common stock and participating security considering both
dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed
earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the period.  The
Company adopted EITF Issue No. 03-6 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.  As
required by EITF Issue No. 03-6, prior period earnings per share have been
restated as follows:

In December 2003, the FASB revised Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 132, "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits" (SFAS No. 132).  The revision of SFAS No.
132 requires expanded disclosures for defined benefit plans.  The standard's
revisions are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003, and
for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003.  See Note 15 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for pensions and other postretirement
benefits disclosures.

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed.  The Act allows
a possible subsidy to retirement health plan sponsors to help offset the costs
of participant prescription drug benefits.  In March 2004, the FASB issued
Staff Position No. 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to
the Act" (the Position).  The Position is effective for interim or annual
periods beginning after June 15, 2004.  The Position allows plan sponsors to
recognize or defer recognizing the effects of the Act in its financial
statements.  Specific accounting guidance for this federal subsidy is pending
and, when issued, could require the Company to change previously reported
information.  The Company's accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and
net periodic pension cost do not reflect the effects of the Act.  The Company
has elected to defer accounting for the Act and has estimated any future effect
on its consolidated financial statements will not be material.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No.
46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51" (the Interpretation).  The Interpretation
requires the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIE) in which an
enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity's expected losses, receives a
majority of the entity's expected residual returns, or both, as a result of
ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity.  Previously,
entities were generally consolidated by an enterprise that had a controlling
financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the
entity.  In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision of the Interpretation
(the Revised Interpretation 46).  Revised Interpretation 46 codifies both the
proposed modifications and other decisions previously issued through certain
FASB Staff Positions and supersedes the original Interpretation to include: (1)
deferring the effective date of the Interpretation's provisions for certain
variable interests, (2) providing additional scope exceptions for certain other
variable interests, (3) clarifying the impact of troubled debt restructurings
on the requirement to reconsider (a) whether an entity is a VIE or (b) which
party is the primary beneficiary of a VIE and (4) revising Appendix B of the
original Interpretation to provide additional guidance on what constitutes  a
variable interest.  Under the new guidance, application of the Revised
Interpretation 46 is required in financial statements of public entities that
have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special-purpose
entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003, and for all other types of
variable interest entities is required in financial statements for periods
ending after March 15, 2004.  The Company's adoption of Revised Interpretation
46 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions.  These estimates and
assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during



the reporting period.  Actual results could differ
from those estimates.  The following is a summary of certain accounting
estimates considered critical by the Company.

Financial instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to
manage its exposure to various market risks, including certain livestock,
interest rates, grain and feed costs, natural gas and other commodities used in the normal
course of operations. The Company may also hold positions for which hedge
accounting, as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS No. 133),
as amended, is not applied.  Derivative financial instruments must be
marked-to-market as of the end of each quarter in which the positions exist. 
As the commodities underlying the Company's derivative financial instruments
can experience significant price fluctuations, any requirement to
mark-to-market the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as
hedges under SFAS No. 133 could result in volatility in the Company's results
of operations.  See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About
Market Risks.

Contingent liabilities

The Company is subject to lawsuits, investigations and
other claims related to wage and hour/labor, livestock procurement, securities,
environmental, product, taxing authorities and other matters, and is required
to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters,
as well as potential ranges of probable losses.  A determination of the amount
of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies are made after considerable
analysis of each individual issue.  These reserves may change in the future due
to changes in the Company's assumptions, the effectiveness of strategies or
other factors beyond the Company's control.  See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Accrued self insurance

Insurance expense for health and welfare, workers'
compensation, auto liability and general liability risks are estimated using
historical experience and actuarial estimates.  The assumptions used to arrive
at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management.  However, actual
expenses could differ from these estimates and could result in adjustments to
be recognized.

Impairment of Long-Lived assets

The Company is required to assess potential
impairments to its long-lived assets, which are primarily property, plant and
equipment.  If impairment indicators are present, the Company must measure the
fair value of the assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets," to determine if adjustments are to be recorded.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairment

In assessing the recoverability of the Company's
goodwill and other intangible assets, management must make assumptions
regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair
value of the respective assets.  If these estimates and related assumptions
change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges
not previously recorded.  The Company assesses its goodwill and other
intangible assets for impairment at least annually in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets."  See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

This
report and other public communications issued by the Company from time to time
include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined as numerical
measures of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows
that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the
most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with
GAAP in the Company's financial statements.

Non-GAAP
financial measures utilized by the Company include presentations of operating
income and other GAAP measures of operating performance that exclude or include
the effect of the closings of selected operations, BSE-related charges, fixed
asset write-downs, impairment charges related to various intangible assets,
litigation settlements and other similar events.  The Company's management
believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to
investors by removing the effect of variances in GAAP reported results of
operations that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the Company's earnings.  Management also believes that the
presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is consistent with its past
practice, as well as industry practice in general, and will enable investors
and analysts to compare current non-GAAP measures with non-GAAP measures
presented in prior periods.  The non-GAAP financial measures used by the
Company should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures
of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.



ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT
MARKET RISKS

MARKET RISKS

Market risks relating to the
Company's operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices, interest
rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. To
address certain of these risks, the Company enters into various derivative
transactions as described below.  If a derivative instrument is a hedge, as
defined by SFAS No. 133, as amended, depending on the nature of the hedge,
changes in the fair value of the instrument will be either offset against the
change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments
through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the
hedged item is recognized in earnings.  The ineffective portion of an
instrument's change in fair value, as defined by SFAS No. 133, as amended, will
be immediately recognized in earnings as a component of cost of sales.  Additionally, the Company holds certain positions,
primarily in grain and livestock futures which do not meet the criteria for
SFAS No. 133 hedge accounting. These positions are marked to fair value and the
unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date. 
The changes in market value of derivatives used in the Company's risk
management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases
of inventories are recorded in cost of sales.  The changes in market value of
derivatives used in the Company's risk management activities surrounding
forward sales contracts are recorded in sales.

The sensitivity analyses presented below are the
measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes
in market prices related to commodities.  Sensitivity analyses do not consider
the actions management may take to mitigate the Company's exposure to changes,
nor do they consider the effects that such hypothetical adverse changes may
have on overall economic activity.  Actual changes in market prices may differ
from hypothetical changes.

Commodities Risk

The Company is a purchaser of certain commodities, such as corn,
soybeans, livestock and natural gas in the course of normal operations.  The
Company uses commodity futures to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a
mechanism to procure the underlying commodity.  However, as the commodities
underlying the Company's derivative financial instruments can experience
significant price fluctuations, any requirement to mark-to-market the positions
that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges under SFAS No. 133
could result in volatility in the Company's results of operations.  Generally,
contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item
providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that are
designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation
criteria are recorded using hedge accounting.  The following table presents a
sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in market
prices as of October 2, 2004, and September 27, 2003, respectively, on fair
value of open positions.  The fair value of such positions is a summation of
the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at
quoted futures prices.  The market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and
non-hedge positions.  The underlying commodities hedged have a correlation to
price changes of the derivative positions such that the values of the commodities
hedged based on differences between commitment prices and market prices and the
value of the derivative positions used to hedge these commodity obligations are
inversely correlated.  The following sensitivity analysis reflects an inverse
impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open positions for
livestock and natural gas and a direct impact on earnings for changes in the
fair value of open positions for grain.

Livestock:

Interest Rate Risk

The Company has exposure to changes in interest rates on its
fixed-rate, long-term debt.  Market risk for fixed-rate, long-term debt is
estimated as the potential increase in fair value, resulting from a
hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates, and amounts to approximately $51
million at October 2, 2004, and $62 million at September 27, 2003.  The fair
values of the Company's long-term debt were estimated based upon quoted market
prices and/or published interest rates.

The Company hedges exposure to changes in interest rates on
certain of its financial instruments. Under the terms of



various leveraged equipment loans, the Company enters into
interest rate swap agreements to effectively lock in a fixed interest rate for
these borrowings. The maturity dates of these leveraged equipment loans range
from 2005 to 2008 with interest rates ranging from 4.7% to 6.0%.  Because
of the positions taken with respect to these swap agreements, an increase in
interest rates would have a minimal effect on the fair value for fiscal years
2004 and 2003.

Foreign Currency Risk

The Company has non-cash foreign exchange gain/loss
exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of
certain receivables and payable balances.  The primary currency exchanges the
Company has exposure to are the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the European
euro, the British pound sterling and
the Brazilian real.  The Company periodically enters into foreign exchange
forward contracts to hedge some of its foreign currency exposure.  There were
no such contracts outstanding at October 2, 2004, and September 27, 2003.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company's financial instruments that are exposed
to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and
trade receivables. The Company's cash equivalents are in high quality
securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations
of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number
of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. The Company performs
periodic credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally
does not require collateral.  At October 2, 2004, and September 27, 2003,
approximately 15.0% and 10.3%, respectively, of the Company's net accounts
receivable balance was due from one customer.  No other single customer or
customer group represents greater than 10% of net accounts receivable.

NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Description of Business:

Tyson Foods, Inc. (collectively,
"the Company" or
"Tyson"), founded in 1935 with world headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas, is
the world's largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef and pork and the
second largest food company in the

Fortune

500.  Tyson produces a wide
variety of brand name protein-based and prepared food products marketed in the
United States and more than 80 countries around the world. Tyson is the
recognized market leader in the retail and foodservice markets it serves. The
Company has approximately 114,000 team members and more than 300 facilities and
offices in 27 states and 20 countries.

Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority-owned
and wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal Year:

The Company utilizes a 52- or 53-week accounting period that ends on the
Saturday closest to September 30.  The Company's accounting cycle resulted in a
53-week year for fiscal year 2004, and a 52-week year for fiscal years 2003 and
2002.

Reclassifications:

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to
current presentations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash equivalents consist of investments in
short-term, highly liquid securities having original maturities of three months
or less, which are made as part of the Company's cash management activity. The
carrying values of these assets approximate their fair market values.  The
Company primarily utilizes a cash management system with a series of separate
accounts consisting of lockbox accounts for receiving cash, concentration
accounts that funds are moved to, and several "zero-balance" disbursement
accounts for funding of payroll, accounts payable and grower payments.  As a
result of the Company's cash management system, checks issued, but not
presented to the banks for payment, may create negative book cash balances.
Checks outstanding in excess of related book cash balances totaling
approximately $359 million at October 2, 2004, and $313 million at September 27,
2003, are included in trade accounts payable and accrued salaries, wages and
benefits.

Accounts Receivable:

The Company records trade accounts receivable at net
realizable value.  This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated
uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts
receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts.  The
Company calculates this allowance based on a history of write-offs, level of
past due accounts and relationships with and economic status of the customers.

Inventories:

Processed products, livestock (excluding breeders) and supplies and other are
valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.   Livestock
includes live cattle, live chicken and live swine.  Cost includes purchased raw
materials, live purchase costs, growout costs (primarily feed, contract grower
pay and catch and haul costs), labor and manufacturing and production overhead,
which are related to the purchase and production of inventories.  Live chicken
consists of broilers and breeders.  Breeders are stated as cost less
amortization.  The costs associated with breeders, including breeder chicks,
feed and medicine, are accumulated up to the production stage and amortized to
broiler inventory over the productive life of the flock using a standard unit
of production.

Total inventory consists of:

in millions



Processed products

Supplies and other



Total inventory

1,994

Depreciation:

Depreciation is provided primarily by the straight-line method using estimated
lives for buildings and leasehold improvements of 10 to 39 years, machinery and
equipment of three to 12 years and other of three to 20 years.



Long-Lived Assets:

The Company reviews
the carrying value of long-lived assets at each balance sheet date if indication
of impairment exists.  Recoverability is assessed using undiscounted cash
flows based upon historical results and current projections of earnings before
interest and taxes.  The Company measures impairment using discounted cash
flows of future operating results based upon a discount rate that corresponds to
the Company's cost of capital.  Impairments are recognized in operating
results to the extent that carrying value exceeds discounted cash flows of
future operations.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:

Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are recorded
at fair value and not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least
annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise, as required by the
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets" (SFAS No. 142).  In the Company's assessment of goodwill,
management makes assumptions by segment regarding estimated future cash flows
and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets.  The
fair value of the Company's trademarks is determined using a royalty rate
method based on expected revenues by trademark.  Goodwill has been allocated to
and tested for impairment by reporting unit based on fair value of identifiable
assets.  This goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.  At October
2, 2004, and September 27, 2003, the accumulated amortization of goodwill was $286
million.

Amount of goodwill by segment at October 2, 2004, and September
27, 2003, was as follows:

in millions



Chicken

$


$


Beef

1,235

1,306

Pork

Total

$

2,558

$

2,652

The change in the goodwill balance is due primarily to
a $91 million adjustment of pre-acquisition tax liabilities assumed as part of
the Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc. (TFM; formerly known as IBP, inc.) acquisition. 
The Company received formal approval during fiscal 2004 from The Joint
Committee on Taxation of the U.S. Congress for issues relating to certain
pre-acquisition years.  As a result of this approval, the accrual of $91
million of pre-acquisition tax liability was no longer needed.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company
recorded charges of approximately $25 million related to the impairment of
various intangible assets, of which $22 million was recorded in the Prepared
Foods segment and $3 million was recorded in the Beef segment.  The impairment
charges apply primarily to trademarks acquired in the acquisition of TFM in
2001.  These impairment charges are included in other charges on the Company's
Consolidated Statements of Income and resulted primarily from lower product
sales under some of the Company's regional trademarks as products are increasingly
being sold under the Tyson trademark.

At October 2, 2004, the gross carrying value of intangible
assets consisted of $80 million of trademarks, $85 million of patents and $11
million of supply contracts with accumulated amortization of $19 million and $8
million for patents and supply contracts, respectively.  At September 27, 2003,
the gross carrying value of intangible assets consisted of $100 million of
trademarks, $87 million of patents and $13 million of supply contracts with
accumulated amortization of $12 million and $6 million for patents and supply
contracts, respectively.  The reductions in the carrying value of intangible
assets in fiscal 2004 as compared to the prior year resulted from the
impairments recorded in fiscal 2004, as trademarks, patents and supply
contracts were impaired $20 million, $3 million and $2 million, respectively.  Amortization
expense on combined patents and supply contracts of $8 million was recognized
during 2004 and 2003 and $9 million was recognized in 2002.  Amortization
expense on intangible assets is estimated to be $7 million for 2005, 2006, and
$6 million for 2007, 2008 and 2009.  Patents and supply contracts are amortized
using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit of 15
years and five years, respectively.

Investments:

The
Company has investments in joint ventures and other entities.  The Company uses
the cost method of accounting where its voting interests are less than 20
percent, and the equity method of accounting where its voting interests are in
excess of 20 percent but not greater than 50 percent.  The Company's underlying
share of each entity's equity is reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in
the line item other assets.



During fiscal 2004, the Company purchased $99 million of
marketable debt securities.  Of this amount, $63 million are due in one year or
less and are classified in other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets,
and $36 million are due in two years and are classified in other assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company has applied Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities" (SFAS No. 115), and has determined that all of its
marketable debt securities are available-for-sale investments. These
investments are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices as of the
balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in
other comprehensive income.  The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted
for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity.  Such
amortization will be recorded in interest income.  The cost of securities sold
is based on the specific identification method.  Realized gains and losses on
the sale of debt securities and declines in value judged to be other than
temporary are recorded in other income, net.  Interest and dividends on
securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded in interest income.

Accrued Self Insurance:

The Company uses a combination of insurance and
self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for health
and welfare, workers' compensation, auto liability and general liability
risks.  Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company
are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience demographic
factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.

Capital Stock:

The Company has two classes of capital stock, Class A common stock (Class A
stock) and Class B common stock (Class B stock).  Holders of Class B stock may
convert such stock into Class A stock on a share-for-share basis. Holders of
Class B stock are entitled to 10 votes per share while holders of Class A stock
are entitled to one vote per share on matters submitted to shareholders for
approval. Cash dividends cannot be paid to holders of Class B stock unless they
are simultaneously paid to holders of Class A stock. The per share amount of
the cash dividend paid to holders of Class B stock cannot exceed 90% of the
cash dividend simultaneously paid to holders of Class A stock. The Company pays
quarterly cash dividends to Class A and Class B shareholders. The Company paid
Class A dividends per share of $0.16 and Class B dividends per share of $0.144
in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002.

According to the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 03-6,
"Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under FASB Statement No.
128, Earnings per Share" (EITF Issue No. 03-6), the Class B stock is considered
a participating security requiring the use of the two-class method for the
computation of basic earnings per share, rather than the if-converted method as
previously used.  The two-class computation method for each period reflects the
cash dividends paid per share for each class of stock, plus the amount of
allocated undistributed earnings per share computed using the participation
percentage which reflects the dividend rights of each class of stock.  Basic
earnings per share reflect the application of EITF Issue No. 03-6 and was
computed using the two-class method for all periods presented.  The shares of
Class B stock are considered to be participating convertible securities since
the shares of Class B stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis into
shares of Class A stock.  Diluted earnings per share have been computed assuming
the conversion of the Class B shares into Class A shares as of the beginning of
each period.

Stock Compensation:

On December 29, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition
and Disclosure" (SFAS No. 148).  SFAS No. 148, which amended Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation," does not require use of the fair value method
of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.  The Company applies
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its employee stock compensation plans.  Accordingly, no
compensation expense was recognized for its stock option issuances as stock
options are issued with an exercise price equal to the closing price at the
date of the grant.  The Company does issue restricted stock and records the
fair value of such awards as deferred compensation amortized over the vesting
period.  Had compensation expense for the employee stock compensation plans
been determined based on the fair value method of accounting for the Company's
stock compensation plans, the tax-effected impact would be as follows:

Financial Instruments:

The Company is a purchaser of certain commodities,
such as corn, soybeans, livestock and natural gas in the course of normal
operations.  The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its
exposure to various market risks.  Generally, contract terms of a hedge
instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of
risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that are designated and highly
effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded
using hedge accounting, as defined by Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS No. 133), as amended.  If a derivative instrument is a hedge, as defined
by SFAS No. 133, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair
value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value
of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or
recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is
recognized in earnings.  The ineffective portion of an instrument's change in
fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings as a component of cost of
sales.  Instruments the Company holds as part of its risk management activities
that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, as defined by SFAS No. 133,
as amended, are marked to fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported
currently in earnings.  The Company generally does not hedge anticipated
transactions beyond 12 months.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss are
transferred to customers, which is generally upon delivery based upon terms of
sale.  Revenue is recognized as the net amount estimated to be received after
deducting estimated amounts for discounts, trade allowances and product terms.

Litigation Reserves:

There are a
variety of legal proceedings pending or threatened against the Company. Accruals
are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law,
progress of each case, opinions and views of legal counsel and other advisers,
the Company's experience in similar matters and management's intended response
to the litigation. These amounts, which are not discounted and are exclusive of
claims against third parties, are adjusted periodically as assessment efforts
progress or additional information becomes
available.  The Company expenses amounts for administering or litigating claims
as incurred. Accruals for legal proceedings are included in other current
liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets.

Freight Expense:

Freight expense associated with products shipped to customers is
recognized in cost of products sold.

Advertising and Promotion Expenses:

Advertising and promotion expenses are charged to
operations in the period incurred. Advertising and promotion expenses for
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $465 million, $504 million and $396 million,
respectively.



Use of Estimates:

The consolidated
financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally
accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards and Regulations:

In December
2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151,
"Inventory Costs" (SFAS No. 151).  SFAS No. 151 requires abnormal
amounts of inventory costs related to idle facility, freight handling and
wasted material expenses to be recognized as current period charges. 
Additionally, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production
overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities.  The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005.  The Company believes the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will
not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

On October 22, 2004, the
President signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Bill).  The
Company is currently in the process of evaluating the Bill.

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-6, "Participating Securities and the
Two-Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share."  This issue
involves the computation of earnings per share for companies that have multiple
classes of common stock or have issued securities other than common stock that
participate in dividends with common stock (participating securities).  The EITF
concluded that companies having participating securities are required to apply
the two-class method to compute earnings per share.  The two-class method is an
earnings allocation method under which earnings per share is calculated for
each class of common stock and participating security considering both
dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed
earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the period.  The
Company adopted EITF Issue No. 03-6 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.  As
required by EITF Issue No. 03-6, prior period earnings per share have been
restated as follows:

In December 2003, the FASB revised Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 132, "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits" (SFAS No. 132).  The revision of SFAS No.
132 requires expanded disclosures for defined benefit plans.  The standard's
revisions are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003, and
for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003.  See Note 15 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for pensions and other postretirement
benefits disclosures.

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed.  The Act allows
a possible subsidy to retirement health plan sponsors to help offset the costs
of participant prescription drug benefits.  In March 2004, the FASB issued
Staff Position No. 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to
the Act" (the Position).  The Position is effective for interim or annual
periods beginning after June 15, 2004.  The Position allows plan sponsors to
recognize or defer recognizing the effects of the Act in its financial
statements.  Specific accounting guidance for this federal subsidy is pending
and, when issued, could require the Company to change previously reported
information.  The Company's accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and
net periodic pension cost do not reflect the effects of the Act.  The Company
has elected to defer accounting for the Act and has estimated any future effect
on its consolidated financial statements will not be material.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46,
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting
Research Bulletin No. 51" (the Interpretation).  The Interpretation
requires the consolidation of variable



interest entities (VIE) in which an enterprise absorbs a majority
of the entity's expected losses, receives a majority of the entity's expected residual returns, or both, as a result of
ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity.  Previously,
entities were generally consolidated by an enterprise that had a controlling
financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the
entity.  In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision of the Interpretation
(the Revised Interpretation 46).  Revised Interpretation 46 codifies both the
proposed modifications and other decisions previously issued through certain
FASB Staff Positions and supersedes the original Interpretation to include: (1)
deferring the effective date of the Interpretation's provisions for certain
variable interests, (2) providing additional scope exceptions for certain other
variable interests, (3) clarifying the impact of troubled debt restructurings
on the requirement to reconsider (a) whether an entity is a VIE or (b) which
party is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, and (4) revising Appendix B of the
original Interpretation to provide additional guidance on what constitutes  a
variable interest.  Under the new guidance, application of the Revised
Interpretation 46 is required in financial statements of public entities that
have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special-purpose
entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003, and for all other types of
variable interest entities is required in financial statements for periods
ending after March 15, 2004.  The Company's adoption of Revised Interpretation
46 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2: ACQUISITIONS

In September 2003, the
Company purchased Choctaw Maid Farms, Inc. (Choctaw), an integrated poultry
processor.  Since 1992, Tyson had been purchasing all of Choctaw's production
under a "cost plus" supply agreement, which was scheduled to expire in 2007. 
The Company had previously negotiated a purchase option with Choctaw's owners,
which initially became exercisable in 2002.  The Company decided to exercise
its purchase option rather than continue under the "cost plus" arrangement of
the supply agreement.  The acquisition was recorded as a purchase in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business
Combinations."  Accordingly, the assets and liabilities were adjusted for fair
values with the remainder of the purchase price, $18 million, recorded as
goodwill. The purchase price consisted of $1 million cash to exercise the
purchase option in Tyson's supply agreement with Choctaw and settlement of $85
million owed to Tyson by Choctaw. In addition the Company assumed approximately
$4 million of Choctaw's debt to a third party.  In June 2003, the Company
exercised a $74 million purchase option to acquire assets leased from a third
party, which the Company had subleased to Choctaw.  Pro forma operating results
reflecting the acquisition of Choctaw would not be materially different from
the Company's actual results of operations.  During 2004, goodwill was reduced
$3 million due to an adjustment of pre-acquisition liabilities assumed as part
of the Choctaw acquisition.

In May 2002, the Company acquired the assets of
Millard Processing Services, a bacon processing operation, for approximately
$73 million in cash. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and
goodwill of approximately $14 million was recorded.

NOTE 3: DISPOSITION

In September 2002, the Company completed the sale of
its Specialty Brands, Inc. subsidiary.  The subsidiary had been acquired with
the TFM acquisition, and its results of operations were included in the
Company's Prepared Foods segment.  The Company received cash proceeds of
approximately $131 million, which were used to reduce indebtedness, and recognized
a pretax gain of $22 million, which was included in other income on the Consolidated
Statement of Income of fiscal 2002.

NOTE 4: OTHER CHARGES

In the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004, the Company implemented a control whereby all plant facilities
conduct fixed asset inventories on a recurring basis.  As a result, the Company
recorded fixed asset write-down charges of approximately $21 million in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, of which approximately $13 million was recorded
in the Chicken segment, $5 million in the Prepared Foods segment, $2 million in
the Beef segment and $1 million in the Pork segment.  Additionally, as
discussed in Note 1, "Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,"
the Company recorded $25 million related to the impairment of various
intangible assets.

In February 2004, the Company announced its decision to
consolidate its manufacturing operations in Jackson, Mississippi, into the
Company's Carthage, Mississippi, facility.  The Company acquired the
Carthage facility when it purchased Choctaw Maid Farms in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2003 and, since that time, performed a comprehensive



analysis of all operations in the area and determined this
consolidation would most effectively maintain the Company's competitiveness in its Mississippi operations.  The Jackson
location employed approximately 800 people and was a poultry processing
facility, including processing and deboning operations.  As a result of this
decision, the Company has recorded total costs of approximately $9 million ($8
million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and $1 million in the third
quarter of fiscal 2004) that includes approximately $8 million of estimated
impairment charges for assets to be disposed of and $1 million of employee
termination benefits.  The Company is accounting for the closing of the Jackson
operation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" (SFAS
No. 146) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (SFAS No. 144).  This amount
is reflected in the Chicken segment as a reduction of operating income and
included in the Consolidated Statements of Income in other charges.  The
Jackson location ceased operations in August 2004.  As of October 2, 2004, the
Company had fully paid its estimated termination benefits of $1 million.

In December 2003, the Company announced its decision
to close its Manchester, New Hampshire, and Augusta, Maine, Prepared Foods operations
to further improve long-term manufacturing efficiencies.  The Manchester
operation employed approximately 550 people and primarily produced sandwich
meat for foodservice customers.  The Augusta facility employed approximately
170 people and produced hot dogs, sausages, boneless hams and deli turkey
products.  These locations ceased operations during the second quarter of
fiscal 2004.  As a result of this decision, the Company recorded total costs of
$24 million ($21 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and $3 million in
the second quarter of fiscal 2004) that included $4 million of costs related to
closing the plants and $20 million of estimated impairment charges for assets
to be disposed.  These amounts are reflected in the Prepared Foods segment as a
reduction of operating income and included in the Consolidated Statements of Income
in other charges.  The costs related to closing the plants include $2 million
of employee termination benefits and $2 million of other plant closing related
costs.  The Company is accounting for the closing of the Manchester and Augusta
operations in accordance with SFAS No. 146 and SFAS No. 144.  At October 2,
2004, $2 million related to employee termination benefits had been paid and $2
million of other plant closing related costs had been paid.

In April 2003, the Company announced its decision to
close its Berlin, Maryland, poultry operation.  The Berlin poultry operation
employed approximately 650 people and included a hatchery, a feed mill, live
production and a processing facility.  The facility ceased processing chickens
November 12, 2003.  As a result of this decision, the Company recorded total
costs of $29 million ($4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and $25
million in fiscal 2003) that included $14 million related to closing the plant
and $15 million of estimated impairment charges for assets to be disposed. 
These amounts are reflected in the Chicken segment as a reduction of operating
income and included in the Consolidated Statements of Income in other charges.
The costs related to closing the plant include $9 million for estimated
liabilities for the resolution of the Company's obligations under 209 grower
contracts, and $5 million of other related costs associated with the closing of
the operation, including plant clean-up costs and employee termination
benefits.  The Company is accounting for the closing of the Berlin operation in
accordance with SFAS No. 146 and SFAS No. 144.  At October 2, 2004, $9 million
of obligations under grower contracts and $3 million of other closing costs had
been paid.  Additionally, a $2 million decrease to the original accrual was
recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company
recorded $47 million of costs related to the closing of its Stilwell, Oklahoma,
and Jacksonville, Florida, plants that included $26 million of costs related to
closing the plants and $21 million of estimated impairment charges for assets
to be disposed.  The costs related to closing the plants include $17 million
for estimated liabilities for the resolution of the Company's obligations under
grower contracts, and $9 million of other related costs associated with the
closing of the plants including plant clean-up costs and employee termination
benefits. The Company accounted for the closing of the Stilwell, Oklahoma, and
Jacksonville, Florida, operations in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
No. 94-3, "Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit
an Activity" (EITF 94-3) and SFAS No. 144.  The costs are reflected
in the Chicken segment as a reduction of operating income and included in the Consolidated
Statements of Income in other charges.  As of October 2, 2004, the remaining
accrual balance was $1 million, as $16 million of obligations under grower
contracts and $13 million of other closing costs had been paid.  Additionally,
a $4 million increase to the original accrual amount was recorded in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004.  No material adjustments to the total accrual are
anticipated at this time.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company recorded $26
million of costs related to the restructuring of its live swine operations that
consists of $21 million of estimated liabilities for resolution of Company
obligations under producer contracts and $5 million of other related costs
associated with this restructuring, including lagoon and pit closure costs and
employee termination benefits.  In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company
recorded an additional reserve of $6 million



related to lagoon and pit closures costs.  At October 2,
2004, the remaining accrual balance was $18 million, as $6 million of obligations under grower contracts and $8 million of
other related costs had been paid.  The Company is accounting for the
restructuring of its live swine operations in accordance with EITF 94-3 and SFAS No. 144.  No material adjustments to the total accrual are
anticipated at this time.

In August 2002, the Company made the decision to capitalize
on the strong recognition of the Tyson brand by expanding the Tyson brand to
beef and pork.  Thus, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company recorded
a write-down of $27 million related to the discontinuation of the Thomas E.
Wilson brand.  This amount is reflected in the Prepared Foods segment as a
reduction to operating income and included on the Consolidated Statements of Income
in other charges.

NOTE 5: BSE-RELATED
CHARGES

On December 23, 2003, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) announced that a single case of BSE had been diagnosed in a
Washington State dairy cow.  The effect on the Company's Beef segment caused by
that announcement, along with the decision of various countries to restrict
imports of U.S. beef products, resulted in the Company recording BSE-related
pretax charges of approximately $61 million in fiscal 2004.  These charges were
included in cost of sales and primarily related to the decline in value of
finished product inventory destined for international markets, whether
in-transit, located at the shipping ports or located within domestic storage,
as well as live cattle inventory and open futures positions.  No material
adjustments were made subsequent to the initial BSE-related accruals recorded in
first quarter of fiscal 2004, and none are anticipated in the future.

NOTE 6: ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

At October 2, 2004, and September 27, 2003, the
allowance for doubtful accounts was $11 million and $16 million, respectively.

NOTE 7: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company purchases certain commodities in the
course of normal operations such as corn, soybeans, livestock and natural gas. 
As part of the Company's on-going commodity risk management activities, the
Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily futures and swaps, to
reduce its exposure to various market risks related to these purchases. 
Generally, contract terms of a financial instrument qualifying as a hedge
instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of
risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that are designated and highly
effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded
using hedge accounting, as defined by Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS No. 133), as amended.  If a derivative instrument is a hedge, as defined
by SFAS No. 133, changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be
offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or
firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income
(loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  The ineffective
portion of an instrument's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in
earnings as a component of cost of sales.

The Company had derivative related balances of $87
million and $20 million recorded in other current assets at October 2, 2004,
and September 27, 2003, respectively, and $83 million and $37 million in other
current liabilities at October 2, 2004, and September 27, 2003, respectively.

Cash flow hedges:

The Company uses derivatives to moderate the financial and commodity
market risks of its business operations. Derivative products, such as futures
and option contracts, are considered to be a hedge against changes in the
amount of future cash flows related to commodities procurement. The Company
also enters into interest rate swap agreements to adjust the proportion of
total long-term debt and leveraged equipment loans that are subject to variable
interest rates. Under these interest rate swaps, the Company agrees to pay a
fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount and to receive in
return an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same
notional principal amount. These interest rate swaps are considered to be a
hedge against changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with the
Company's variable rate interest payments.

The effective portion of the cumulative gain or loss on the
derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income
(loss) in shareholders' equity and recognized into earnings in the same period
or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings (for grain
commodity hedges when the chickens that consumed the hedged grain are sold). 
The remaining cumulative gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of
the cumulative change in



the present value of the future cash flows of the hedged item, if any, is
recognized in earnings during the period of change. 
No ineffectiveness was recognized on cash flow hedges during
fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002.

Derivative products related to grain
procurement, such as futures and option contracts that meet the criteria for
SFAS No. 133 hedge accounting, are considered cash flow hedges, as they hedge
against changes in the amount of future cash flows related to commodities
procurement.  The Company applies SFAS No. 133 hedge accounting to derivative
products related to grain procurement that are hedging physical grain contracts
that have previously been purchased.  The Company does not purchase derivative
products related to grain procurement in excess of its physical grain
consumption requirements.  The Company expects that the after tax losses, net
of gains, totaling approximately $22 million recorded in other comprehensive
income (loss) at October 2, 2004, related to cash flow hedges, will be
recognized within the next 12 months. The Company generally does not hedge cash
flows related to commodities beyond 12 months.  The Company's open
mark-to-market SFAS No. 133 hedge positions were not significant as of October
2, 2004.

Fair value hedges:

The Company designates certain
futures contracts as fair value hedges of firm commitments to purchase
livestock for slaughter and natural gas for the operation of its plants.  From
time to time, the Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts
to hedge changes in fair value of receivables and purchase commitments arising
from changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies; however, the Company
has not entered into any such contracts in fiscal years 2004 or 2003.  Changes
in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that is
designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, along with the loss or gain on
the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk
(including losses or gains on firm commitments), are recorded in current period
earnings.  Ineffectiveness results when the change in the fair value of the
hedge instrument differs from the change in fair value of the hedged item. 
Ineffectiveness recorded related to the Company's fair value hedges was not
significant during fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002.

Undesignated positions:

The Company holds positions as
part of its risk management activities, primarily certain grain and livestock
futures for which it does not apply SFAS No. 133 hedge accounting, but instead
marks these positions to fair value through earnings at each reporting date.  Changes in market value of derivatives used in the
Company's risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or
anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales.  Changes in
market value of derivatives used in the Company's risk management activities
surrounding forward sales contracts are recorded in sales. The Company generally does not enter into
undesignated positions beyond 12 months.

Based on the Company's evaluation of the grain
markets, the Company has at times entered into a portion of its derivative
products related to grain procurement prior to purchasing the physical grain
contracts. The Company has not applied SFAS No. 133 hedge accounting treatment
for these derivative positions.  In connection with these risk management activities,
the Company recognized pretax net gains of approximately $58 million and pretax
net losses of approximately $4 million in cost of sales for fiscal years ended
October 2, 2004, and September 27, 2003, respectively.  The current year
derivative gains were due primarily to the increase in grain futures prices
during the second fiscal quarter and the Company having a higher number of
derivative positions in place at that time as compared to the same period in
the prior year.

Additionally, the Company enters into certain forward
sales of boxed beef and pork at fixed prices and has positions in livestock
futures to mitigate the market risk associated with these fixed price forward
sales. The fixed price sales contract locks in the proceeds from a sale in the
future, although, the cost of the livestock and the related boxed beef and pork
market prices at the time of the sale will vary from this fixed price, creating
market risk. Therefore, as fixed forward sales are entered into, the Company
also enters into the appropriate number of livestock futures positions.  The
Company believes this is an effective economic hedge; however, the correlation
does not qualify for SFAS No. 133 hedge accounting. Consequently, changes in
market value of the open livestock futures positions are marked to market and
reported in earnings at each reporting date even though the economic impact of
the Company's fixed sales price being above or below the market price is only
realized at the time of sale. In connection with these livestock futures, the
Company had unrealized pretax gains on open mark-to-market futures positions of
approximately $15 million as of October 2, 2004, and $16 million as of
September 27, 2003.

respectively.  All other financial instruments' fair values approximate
recorded values at October 2, 2004, and September 27, 2003.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company's financial instruments that are exposed
to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and
trade receivables. The Company's cash equivalents are in high quality
securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations
of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number
of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. The Company performs
periodic credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally
does not require collateral.  At October 2, 2004, and September 27, 2003,
approximately 15.0% and 10.3%, respectively, of the Company's net accounts
receivable balance was due from one customer.  No other single customer or
customer group represents greater than 10% of net accounts receivable.

respectively.  The Company capitalized interest costs of $3 million in 2004 and
2003, and $9 million in 2002 as part of the cost of major asset construction
projects. Approximately $492 million will be required to complete construction
projects in progress at October 2, 2004.

NOTE 10: COMMITMENTS

The Company leases certain farms and other properties
and equipment for which the total rentals thereon approximated $111 million in 2004,
$104 million in 2003 and $105 million in 2002. Most leases have terms ranging
from one to seven years with varying renewal periods. The most significant
obligations assumed under the terms of the leases are the upkeep of the
facilities and payments of insurance and property taxes.

Minimum lease commitments under non-cancelable leases
at October 2, 2004, totaled $158 million composed of $63 million for fiscal 2005,
$39 million for fiscal 2006, $29 million for fiscal 2007, $16 million for fiscal
2008, $9 million for fiscal 2009 and $2 million for later years.

The Company guarantees debt of outside third parties,
which involve a lease and grower loans, all of which are substantially
collateralized by the underlying assets.  Terms of the underlying debt range
from seven to 11 years and the maximum potential amount of future payments as
of October 2, 2004, was $55 million.  The Company also maintains operating
leases for various types of equipment, some of which contain residual value
guarantees for the market value for assets at the end of the term of the
lease.  The terms of the lease maturities range from one to seven years.  The
maximum potential amount of the residual value guarantees is approximately $110
million, of which approximately $28 million would be recoverable through
various recourse provisions and an undeterminable recoverable amount based on
the fair market value of the underlying leased assets.  The likelihood of
payments under these guarantees is not considered probable.  At October 2, 2004, and September 27,
2003, no liabilities for guarantees were recorded.

Additionally, the Company also enters into future
purchase commitments for various items such as corn, soybeans, livestock and
natural gas contracts.  At October 2, 2004, these commitments totaled $287
million, composed of $220 million for fiscal 2005, $50 million for fiscal 2006,
$8 million for fiscal 2007, $2 million for fiscal 2008, $2 million for fiscal
2009 and $5 million for later years.

NOTE 11: LONG-TERM DEBT

The Company has unsecured revolving credit facilities
totaling $1 billion that support the Company's commercial paper program,
letters of credit and other short-term funding needs.  During the third quarter
of fiscal 2004, the Company restructured and extended its revolving credit
facilities.  These facilities now consist of $250 million that expire in
September 2006 and $750 million that expire in June 2009.  At October 2, 2004,
the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $274
million issued primarily in support of workers' compensation insurance
programs, derivative activities and leveraged equipment loans.  There were no
draw downs under these letters of credit at October 2, 2004.  At October 2,
2004, and September 27, 2003, there were no amounts drawn under the revolving
credit facilities; however, the outstanding letters of credit reduce the amount
available under the revolving credit facilities.

The Company has a receivables purchase agreement with
three co-purchasers to sell up to $750 million of trade receivables.  These
agreements were restructured and extended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004
and now consist of $375 million expiring in August 2005, and $375 million expiring
in August 2007.  The receivables purchase agreement has been accounted for as a
borrowing and has an interest rate based on commercial paper issued by the
co-purchasers.  Under this agreement, substantially all of the Company's
accounts receivable are sold to a special purpose entity, Tyson Receivables
Corporation (TRC), which is a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of the
Company.  TRC has its own separate creditors that are entitled to be satisfied
out of all of the assets of TRC prior to any value becoming available to the
Company as TRC's equity holder.  At October 2, 2004, there was $150 million
outstanding under the receivables purchase agreement expiring in August 2005
and $150 million under the agreement expiring August 2007, while at September
27, 2003, there was no outstanding balance.

Under the terms of the leveraged equipment loans, the
Company had cash deposits totaling approximately $57 million, which was included
in other assets at October 2, 2004. Under these leveraged loan agreements, the
Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively lock in a
fixed interest rate for these borrowings.

Annual maturities of long-term debt for the five fiscal
years subsequent to October 2, 2004, are: 2005-$338 million; 2006-$261 million;
2007-$1,048 million; 2008-$14 million; 2009-$91 million.

The revolving credit facilities, senior notes, notes and accounts
receivable securitization contain various covenants, the more restrictive of
which contain a maximum allowed leverage ratio and a minimum required interest
coverage ratio.  The



Company is in compliance with all of its covenants at fiscal year
end.

Industrial revenue bonds are secured by facilities
with a net book value of $41 million and $159 million at October 2, 2004, and
September 27, 2003, respectively, as three industrial revenue bonds were paid
off in fiscal 2004.

NOTE 13: STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK

The shareholders approved the Tyson Foods, Inc. 2000
Stock Incentive Plan (Incentive Plan) in January 2001. The Incentive Plan is
administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and
permits awards of shares of Class A stock, awards of derivative securities
related to the value of Class A stock and tax reimbursement payments to
eligible persons. The Incentive Plan provides for the award of a variety of
equity-based incentives such as incentive stock options, nonqualified stock
options, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, performance
unit awards and phantom shares. The Incentive Plan provides for granting
incentive stock options for shares of Class A stock at a price not less than
the fair market value at the date of grant. Nonqualified stock options may be
granted at a price equal to, less than or more than the fair market value of
Class A stock on the date that the option is granted.  Stock options under the
Incentive Plan generally become exercisable ratably over three to eight years
from the date of grant and must be exercised within 10 years from the date of
grant.

A summary of the Company's stock option activity is as
follows:

The weighted average fair value of options granted
during 2004 was approximately $5.99. The fair value of each option grant is
established on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Assumptions include an expected life ranging from five to six years, risk-free
interest rate ranging from 3.09% to 3.27%, expected volatility ranging from 37.7%
to 40.1% and dividend yield of 1.00%.

At October 2, 2004, the Company had outstanding
approximately eight million restricted shares of Class A stock with
restrictions expiring over periods through July 1, 2020. The unearned portion
of the restricted stock is classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as
unamortized deferred compensation in shareholders' equity.  The Company issues
restricted stock at the market value as of the date of grant.  The weighted
average fair value of restricted stock granted was $15.69 per share during 2004
and $11.20 per share during 2003.

NOTE 14: DEFERRED COMPENSATION

In July 2003, the Compensation Committee authorized
the Company to award performance-based shares of the Company's Class A stock to
certain senior executive officers on the first business day of each of the
Company's 2004, 2005 and 2006 fiscal years having an initial maximum aggregate
value of $4.4 million on the date of each award.  The vesting of the
performance-based shares for the 2004 and 2005 awards is over three years, and
the vesting of the 2006 award is over two and one-half years (the Vesting
Period), each award being subject to the attainment of Company goals determined
by the Compensation Committee prior to the date of the award.  Each quarter
during the Vesting Period, the Company reviews progress toward attainment of
Company goals and determines if it is appropriate to record any adjustment to
the deferred compensation liability for the anticipated vesting of the shares. 
The attainment of Company goals can be finally determined only at the end of
the Vesting Period.  If the shares vest, the ultimate expense to the Company
recognized over the Vesting Period will be equal to the Class A stock price on
the date the shares vest times the number of shares awarded.

NOTE 15:  PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has both funded and
unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering specific groups
of employees.  Two plans provide benefits based on a formula using years
of service and a specified benefit rate.  Effective January 1,
2004, the Company implemented a new defined benefit plan for certain
contracted officers that uses a formula based on years of service and final
average salary.  The Company also has other postretirement benefit plans
for which substantially all of its employees may receive benefits if they
satisfy applicable eligibility criteria.  The postretirement healthcare
plans are contributory with participants' contributions adjusted when deemed
necessary.

The Company has defined contribution retirement and
incentive benefit programs for various groups of Company personnel. Company
contributions totaled $55 million, $48 million and $50 million in 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

The Company uses a September 30 measurement date for
its defined benefit plans and one postretirement medical plan and a July 31
measurement date for its remaining postretirement medical plans.

Other postretirement benefits include postretirement
medical costs and life insurance.

To determine the rate-of-return on assets assumption,
the Company first examined actual historical rates of return for the various
asset classes.  The Company then determined a long-term projected rate-of-return
based on expected returns over the next five to 10 years.  Prior to fiscal year
2004, the Company only had defined benefit plans which provided a retirement
benefit based on the number of years of service multiplied by a benefit rate. 
During 2004, a plan was added with a 4% compensation increase inherent in its
benefit obligation calculation.

The Company has four postretirement health plans.  Two of these consist of
fixed, annual payments by the Company and account for $36 million of the
Company's postretirement medical obligation at October 2, 2004.  A
healthcare cost trend is not required to determine this obligation.  A
third plan has a negotiated annual maximum payment by the Company and accounts
for $12 million of the Company's postretirement medical obligation at October 2,
2004.  Claims in excess of the Company's negotiated annual maximum payment
are paid by the plan participants.  Since current medical claims exceed the
annual maximum cap for this plan, the liability was calculated assuming that
annual claims will be equal to the total annual maximum cap for all future
years.  A healthcare cost trend is not required to determine this
obligation.  The fourth



plan, which accounts for $18 million of the Company's
postretirement medical obligation at year end, uses a healthcare cost trend of

The Plan Trustees have established a set of investment
objectives related to the assets of the pension plans and regularly monitor the
performance of the funds and portfolio managers.  Objectives for the pension
assets are (1) to provide growth of capital and income, (2) to achieve a target
weighted average annual rate of return that is competitive with other funds with
similar investment objectives and (3) to diversify in order to reduce risk.  The investment
objectives and target asset allocation were updated in January 2004.

Contributions

The Company's policy is to fund at least the minimum
contribution required to meet applicable federal employee benefit and local tax
laws.  In its sole discretion, the Company may from time to time fund
additional amounts.  Expected contributions to the Company's pension plans for
fiscal year 2005 are approximately $9 million.  For the fiscal years ended
2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company funded $9 million, $4 million and $5 million,
respectively, to its defined benefit plans.

NOTE 16: SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION

The following non-cash transaction was excluded from
the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for fiscal year 2004.  The $91
million change in goodwill in fiscal 2004 from the September 27, 2003, balance
and the corresponding change in other current liabilities is due to an
adjustment of pre-acquisition tax liabilities assumed as part of the TFM
acquisition.  The Company received formal approval during fiscal 2004 from The
Joint Committee on Taxation of the U.S. Congress for issues relating to certain
pre-acquisition years.  As a result of this approval, the accrual of $91
million of pre-acquisition tax liability was no longer needed.

The following table summarizes cash payments for
interest and income taxes:

in millions




Interest

$

Income taxes, net of refunds




Cash payments for interest in fiscal year 2004
increased, despite lower debt levels, due to the timing of interest payments
made related to the senior notes caused by fiscal 2004 ending in October rather
than September.  The increase in income taxes paid from 2003 to 2004 is due
primarily to a refund received in fiscal 2003.

NOTE 17: TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

The Company has operating leases for farms, equipment
and other facilities with Don Tyson, a director
of the Company, certain members of his family and the Randal W. Tyson
Testamentary Trust.  Total payments of $8 million in 2004 and 2003, and $9 million in 2002,
were paid to entities in which these parties had an ownership interest. 
Additionally, other facilities have been leased from other officers and
directors. Rentals paid to entities in which these parties had an ownership
interest totaled $1 million in 2004 and $2 million in 2003 and 2002.

A former director who resigned from the Board of
Directors during 2003 received, from the sale of cattle to a subsidiary of the
Company, $10 million in fiscal years 2003 and 2002.

Certain officers and directors were engaged in chicken
and swine growout operations with the Company whereby these individuals
purchased animals, feed, housing and other items to raise the animals to market
weight. The total value of these transactions, which were discontinued during
fiscal 2003, amounted to $11 million in each fiscal year of 2003 and 2002.

On May 21, 2004, the
Company purchased a parcel of land adjacent to the Company's Corporate Center for approximately $356,000 from JHT, LLC, a
limited liability company of which Don Tyson, a director of the Company, and
the Randal W. Tyson Testamentary Trust are members.  The purchase was approved
by the Governance Committee of the Board of Directors on April 29, 2004, and the
land is to be used for construction of facilities that will house expanded
product development kitchens, a new pilot production plant, provide space for
the consumer insights group and make provisions for team member development
activities.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company
purchased 1,028,577 shares of Class A stock in a private transaction with Don
Tyson, a director and managing partner of the Tyson Limited Partnership, a
principal shareholder of the Company.  The purchase of those shares from Mr.
Tyson, which was approved by the Governance Committee of the Board of Directors
on January 29, 2004, was based on the closing price of the Class A stock on the
New York Stock Exchange on the date of such approval.

During fiscal 2004, the Company received cash payments
from Don Tyson, a director of the Company,  totaling $1.5
million, as reimbursement for certain perquisites and personal benefits
received during fiscal years 1997 through 2003.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company
adjusted the tax rates used to record deferred taxes at one of its Mexican
subsidiaries resulting in a reduction of deferred tax liabilities of $16
million.  This adjustment is included in "Other" in the above table for fiscal 2004. 
Other items included in "Other" are miscellaneous nondeductible expenses,
general business credits and amounts relating to on-going examinations by taxing
authorities.

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled.

The deferred
tax liability for suspended taxes from
conversion to accrual method represents the 1987 change from the cash to
accrual method of accounting and will be paid down by 2017, subject to income
limitations.

The Company has accumulated but undistributed earnings
of foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $387 million at October 2,
2004, that are expected to be permanently reinvested in the business. If those
earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company
would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax
credits), state income taxes and withholding taxes payable to the various
foreign countries. It is not currently practicable to estimate the tax
liability that might be payable on the repatriation of these foreign earnings.

The valuation allowance totaling $66 million consists
of $15 million for state tax credit carryforwards, which have been fully
reserved, $36 million for U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and $15
million for international net operating loss carryforwards.  The state tax
credit carryforwards expire in the years 2005 through 2009.  At October 2, 2004,
after considering utilization restrictions, the Company's federal tax loss
carryforwards approximated $209 million. The net operating loss carryforwards, which
are subject to utilization limitations due to ownership changes, may be
utilized to offset future taxable income subject to limitations. These
carryforwards expire during years 2005 through 2023.

NOTE 20: SEGMENT REPORTING

The Company operates in five business segments: Chicken,
Beef, Pork, Prepared Foods and Other. The
Company measures segment profit as operating income.

Chicken segment

is involved primarily in the processing of live chickens into fresh, frozen and
value-added chicken products.  The Chicken segment markets its products
domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors, restaurant operators
and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, hotel chains,
healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well as to
international markets throughout the world.   The Chicken segment also includes
sales from allied products and the chicken breeding stock subsidiary.

Beef segment

is involved primarily in the
processing of live fed cattle and fabrication of dressed beef carcasses into
primal and sub-primal meat cuts and case-ready products. It also involves
deriving value from allied products such as hides and variety meats for sale to
further processors and others.  The Beef
segment markets its products domestically to food retailers, foodservice
distributors, restaurant operators and noncommercial foodservice establishments
such as schools, hotel chains, healthcare facilities, the military and other
food processors, as well as to international markets throughout the world. Allied products are also marketed to
manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and technical products.

Pork segment

is involved primarily in the processing of live market hogs and fabrication of
pork carcasses into primal and sub-primal cuts and case-ready products.  This
segment also represents the Company's live swine group and related allied
product processing activities. The Pork segment markets its products
domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors, restaurant operators
and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, hotel chains,
healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well as to
international markets throughout the world.  It also sells allied products to
pharmaceutical and technical products manufacturers, as well as live swine to
pork processors.

Prepared Foods

segment

includes the Company's operations that manufacture and market
frozen and refrigerated food products.  Products include pepperoni, beef and
pork toppings, pizza crusts, flour and corn tortilla products, appetizers, prepared
meals, ethnic foods, soups, sauces, side dishes and meat dishes, as well as
branded and processed meats.  The Prepared Foods segment markets its products
domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors, restaurant operators
and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, hotel chains,
healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well as to
international markets throughout the world.

Other segment

includes the logistics group and other corporate activities not identified with
specific protein groups. This segment also includes proceeds of $167 million received
in fiscal 2003 related to the settlement of vitamin antitrust litigation.



The Pork segment had sales of $473 million, $365
million and $369 million for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
from transactions with other operating segments of the Company.  The Beef
segment had sales of $75 million, $77 million and $63 million for fiscal years
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, from transactions with other operating
segments of the Company.  The aforementioned sales from intersegment
transactions, which are sold at market prices, were excluded from the segment
sales in the above table.

The Company's largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,
accounted for approximately 11.6%, 9.6% and 8.2% of consolidated sales in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.  Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. were included in
the Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods segments.  Any extended
discontinuance of sales to this customer could, if not replaced, have a
material impact on the Company's operations; however, the Company does not
anticipate any such occurrences due to the demand for its products.

The majority of the Company's operations are domiciled
in the United States.  Approximately 94%, 95% and 94% of sales to external
customers for fiscal years ending 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were
sourced from the United States.  Approximately $6.4 billion of long-lived
assets were located in the United States at fiscal year ending 2004, and $6.5
billion at fiscal years ending 2003 and 2002.  Approximately $171 million, $185
million and $193 million of long-lived assets were located in foreign
countries, primarily Canada and Mexico, at fiscal years ended 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

The Company sells certain of its products in foreign
markets, primarily Canada, China, European Union, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico,
Russia, Taiwan and South Korea.  The Company's export sales for 2004, 2003 and
2002 totaled $2.1 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. 
Substantially all of the Company's export sales are facilitated through
unaffiliated brokers, marketing associations and foreign sales staffs.  Foreign
sales, which are sales of products produced in a country other than the United
States, were less than 10% of total consolidated sales for 2004, 2003 and 2002. 
Approximately 28%, 15% and 11% for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, of income
before taxes were from foreign operations.  The increase in fiscal 2004
primarily was due to increased volumes and margins at the Company's Lakeside
operation in Canada.

million related to the write-down of an equity interest in a live swine
operation.  Fourth quarter 2003 gross profit includes $3 million received in
connection with vitamin antitrust litigation and operating income includes $10
million of charges related to the closing of poultry operations.

NOTE 22: CONTINGENCIES

Listed below are certain claims made against the
Company and its subsidiaries.  In the Company's opinion, it has made
appropriate and adequate reserves and accruals where necessary and the Company
believes the probability of a material loss beyond the amounts accrued to be
remote; however, the ultimate liability for these matters is uncertain, and if
accruals and reserves are not adequate, an adverse outcome could have a
material effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of
operations of the Company.  The Company believes it has substantial defenses to
the claims made and intends to vigorously defend these cases.

Wage and Hour/ Labor Matters

:

In 2000, the Wage and Hour Division of the
U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) conducted an industry-wide investigation of
poultry producers, including the Company, to ascertain compliance with various
wage and hour issues.  As part of this investigation, the DOL inspected 14
of the Company's processing facilities.



On May 9, 2002, the Secretary of Labor
filed a civil complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Alabama.  The complaint alleges that the Company violated
the overtime provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) at the
Company's chicken-processing facility in Blountsville, Alabama.  The complaint
does not contain a definite statement of what acts constituted alleged
violations of the statute, although the Secretary of Labor has indicated in
discovery that the case seeks to require the Company to compensate all hourly
chicken processing workers for pre- and post-shift clothes changing, washing
and related activities and for one of two unpaid 30-minute meal periods.  The
Secretary of Labor seeks unspecified back wages for all employees at the
Blountsville facility for a period of two years prior to the date of the filing
of the complaint, an additional amount in unspecified liquidated damages, and
an injunction against future violations at that facility and all other chicken
processing facilities operated by the Company.  The parties are in the process
of concluding discovery.  The Secretary of Labor's motion to extend certain
case deadlines is pending before the court.

On June 22, 1999, 11 current and former employees of
the Company filed the case of

M.H. Fox, et al. v. Tyson

Foods, Inc.
(Fox)

in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama
claiming the Company violated requirements of the FLSA.  The suit alleges the
Company failed to pay employees for all hours worked and/or improperly paid
them for overtime hours. The suit specifically alleges that (1) employees
should be paid for time taken to put on and take off certain working supplies
at the beginning and end of their shifts and breaks and (2) the use of
"mastercard" or "line" time fails to pay employees for all
time actually worked. Plaintiffs seek to represent themselves and all similarly
situated current and former employees of the Company, and plaintiffs seek
reimbursement for an unspecified amount of unpaid wages, liquidated damages,
attorney fees and costs.  At filing, 159 current and/or former employees
consented to join the lawsuit and, to date, approximately 5,100 consents have
been filed with the court. Plaintiff's motion for conditional collective
treatment and court-supervised notice to additional putative class members was
denied on February 27, 2004.  The plaintiffs refiled their motion for
conditional collective treatment and court-supervised notice to additional putative
class members on April 2, 2004.  Discovery in this case is largely completed. 
No trial date has been set.

On August 22, 2000, seven employees of the Company
filed the case of

De Asencio v. Tyson Foods, Inc.

in the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. This lawsuit is similar to

Fox

in that the employees claim violations of the FLSA for allegedly failing to pay
for time taken to put on, take off and sanitize certain working supplies, and
violations of the Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law.  Plaintiffs
seek to represent themselves and all similarly situated current and former
employees of the poultry processing plant in New Holland, Pennsylvania, and
plaintiffs seek reimbursement for an unspecified amount of unpaid wages,
liquidated damages, attorney fees and costs. Currently, there are approximately
560 additional current or former employees who have filed consents to join the
lawsuit. The court, on January 30, 2001, ordered that notice of the lawsuit be
issued to all potential plaintiffs at the New Holland facilities.  On July 17,
2002, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion to certify the state law
claims.  On September 23, 2002, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to
hear the Company's petition to review the court's decision to certify the state
law claims.   On September 8, 2003, the Court of Appeals reversed the district
court's certification of a class under the Pennsylvania Wage Payment &
Collection Law, ruling that those claims could not be pursued in federal
court.  The appellate court further ruled that the Company must reissue notice
of their potential FLSA claims to approximately 2,170 employees who did not
previously receive notice.  The Court of Appeals remanded the matter to the
district court to proceed accordingly on September 30, 2003, and notice was
reissued. Further proceedings in the district court are pending, and no trial
date has been set.

Substantially similar suits have been filed against
several other integrated poultry companies. In addition, organizing activity
conducted by representatives or affiliates of the United Food and Commercial
Workers Union against the poultry industry has encouraged worker participation
in

Fox v. Tyson

and the other lawsuits.

On November 5, 2001, a lawsuit entitled

Maria
Chavez, et al. v. IBP, Lasso Acquisition Corporation and

Tyson Foods,
Inc. (Chavez)

was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Washington against TFM and the Company by several employees of
TFM's Pasco, Washington, beef slaughter and processing facility alleging
various violations of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. Sections 201 - 219, as well as
violations of the Washington State Minimum Wage Act, RCW chapter 49.46,
Industrial Welfare Act, RCW chapter 49.12, and the Wage Deductions-Contribution-Rebates
Act, RCW chapter 49.52. The

Chavez

lawsuit alleges TFM and/or the
Company required employees to perform unpaid work related to the donning and
doffing of certain personal protective clothing and equipment, both prior to and after their
shifts, as well as during meal periods. Plaintiffs further allege that similar
prior litigation entitled

Alvarez, et al. v. IBP (Alvarez),

which
resulted in a $3.1 million final judgment against TFM, supports a claim of
collateral estoppel and/or is res judicata as to the issues raised in this new
litigation.  Plaintiffs are seeking reimbursement for an unspecified amount of
damages, exemplary damages, liquidated damages, prejudgment interest, attorney
fees and costs.  TFM filed a timely Notice of



Appeal in

Alvarez

and
plaintiffs filed a timely notice of Cross-Appeal.  On August 5, 2003, the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's decision in part and
reversed the lower court's decision in part, and remanded the case to the lower
court for recalculation of damages.  If the ruling of the Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals is upheld in its entirety, TFM will have additional exposure in

Alvarez

of approximately $5 million.  TFM filed a petition for rehearing by the
panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that heard

Alvarez

or, in
the alternative, a rehearing en banc, which was denied on December 2, 2003.  It
also filed a petition to certify state law claims to the Washington Supreme
Court which was denied on September 23, 2003.  On December 5, 2003, TFM
filed a Petition to Stay the Mandate indicating it would file a Petition for
Certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking the Court's review of the Ninth
Circuit's adverse opinion.  A Stay of the Mandate was ordered by the Ninth
Circuit on December 10, 2003.  A Petition for Certiorari was filed with the
U.S. Supreme Court on February 26, 2004.  Briefing on the Petition is now
complete, and, on May 3, 2004, the Court invited the U.S. Solicitor General to
express its views on the pending Petition.  On October 25, 2004, the
Solicitor filed its response which acknowledged the issues warranted review but
advised that a First Circuit case would be better suited for the Court's
consideration of the issues.

Chavez

initially was pursued as an opt-in, collective action under 29 U.S.C. 216(b),
but the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington granted
plaintiff's motion seeking certification of a class of opt-out, state law plaintiffs
under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 and notice was sent to potential state
law claim class members.  The state-law class is closed and contains
approximately 3,900 class members, including approximately 1,200 on the federal
claim.  The trial was held from September 7, 2004, through October 4, 2004. 
The District Court issued its proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law
on December 8, 2004.  The District Court has informed the parties they have
until January 13, 2005, to provide the District Court with briefs on the
proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and until January 28, 2005, to
file reply briefs.  The District Court intends to hear oral arguments on
February 24, 2005, before issuing its final order.  The damages phase of the
trial will then commence before a judgment is entered.

On
November 21, 2002, a lawsuit entitled

Emily
D. Jordan, et al. v. IBP, inc. and Tyson Foods, Inc

., was filed in the U.S. District Court for
the Middle District of Tennessee.  Ten current and former hourly employees of
TFM's case-ready facility in Goodlettsville, Tennessee, filed a complaint on
behalf of themselves and other unspecified, allegedly "similarly
situated" employees, claiming that the defendants have violated the
overtime provisions of the FLSA.  The suit alleges that the Company has failed
to pay employees for all hours worked from the plant's commencement of
operations under TFM's control in April 2001.  The Company acquired the plant
as part of its acquisition of TFM.  In particular, the suit alleges that
employees should be paid for the time it takes to collect, assemble and put
on, take off and wash their health, safety and production gear at the
beginning and end of their shifts and during their meal period.  The suit also
alleges that the Company deducts 30 minutes per day from employees' paychecks
regardless of whether employees obtain a full 30-minute period for their meal. 
Plaintiffs are seeking a declaration that the defendants did not comply with
the FLSA, and an award for an unspecified amount of back pay compensation and
benefits, unpaid entitlements, liquidated damages, prejudgment and
post-judgment interest, attorney fees and costs.  On January 10, 2003, another
31 employees from Tennessee filed consents to join the lawsuit as plaintiffs. 
On January 15, 2003, the Company filed an answer to the complaint denying any
liability. On January 14, 2003, the named plaintiffs filed a motion for
expedited court-supervised notice to prospective class members.   The motion
sought to conditionally certify a class of similarly situated employees at all
of TFM's non-union facilities that have not been the subject of FLSA
litigation.  Plaintiffs then withdrew a request for conditional certification
of similarly situated employees at all of TFM's non-union facilities and rather
sought to include all non-exempt employees that have worked at the
Goodlettsville facility since its opening on April 1, 2001.  On June 9, 2003,
the Company filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking the applicability of
the injunction entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas
and affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit

(Metzler v.
IBP, inc. 127 F. 3

rd

959, 10

th

Cir. 1997)

, which the
Company contends has a preclusive effect as to plaintiffs' claims based on pre-
and post-shift activities.  The plaintiffs conducted discovery limited to that
issue and responded to said Motion on June 18, 2004.  The Company filed its reply
on July 2, 2004.  On October 12, 2004, the District Court denied the Company's
motion for summary judgment.  On November 17, 2003, the District Court
conditionally certified a collective action composed of similarly situated
current and former employees at the Goodlettsville facility based upon clothes
changing and washing activities and unpaid production work during meal periods,
since the plant operations began in April 2001.  Class Notices to approximately
4,500 prospective class members were mailed on January 21, 2004.   Presently,
approximately 525 current and former employees have opted into the class.  The
District Court stayed discovery on November 8, 2004, pending the Supreme
Court's decision on certiorari in

Alvarez

.

Environmental Matters:

On
October 23, 2001, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the District
Court for Mayes County, Oklahoma, against the Company by R. Lynn Thompson and
Deborah S. Thompson on behalf of all owners of Grand Lake O' the Cherokee's
littoral (lakefront) property. The suit alleges that the Company "or entities
over which it has operational control" conduct operations in such a way as to
interfere with the putative class action plaintiffs' use and



enjoyment of their property, allegedly caused by diminished water quality in the
lake.  Plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief and an unspecified amount
of compensatory damages, punitive
damages, attorney fees and costs.  Simmons Foods, Inc. (Simmons) and
Peterson Farms, Inc. (Peterson) have been joined as defendants.  The
Company and Simmons are
seeking leave to file a third party complaint against entities that contribute
wastes and wastewater into Grand Lake. The class certification hearing was held
in October 2003.  On December 11, 2003, the trial court entered an order
which granted class certification. On January 12, 2004, the Company, Simmons and
Peterson filed a Petition in Error (the  Petition) in the Oklahoma Supreme
Court which challenges and seeks appellate level review of the trial court's
certification order.   The Oklahoma Supreme Court has not yet
scheduled proceedings on the Petition.

Securities Matters:

Between June 22 and July 20, 2001, various plaintiffs commenced
actions (the Delaware Federal Actions) against the Company, Don Tyson, John Tyson
and Les Baledge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware,
seeking monetary damages on behalf of a purported class of those who sold IBP,
inc. (IBP) stock from March 29, 2001, when the Company announced its intention
to terminate its merger agreement with IBP, through June 15, 2001, when a
Delaware state court rendered its Post-Trial Opinion ordering the merger to
proceed.  Plaintiffs in the various actions alleged that the defendants
violated federal securities laws by making, causing or allowing to be made,
certain allegedly false and misleading statements in a March 29, 2001, press
release issued in connection with the Company's attempted termination of the
Merger Agreement.  The plaintiffs alleged that, as a result of the defendants' alleged
conduct, purported class members were harmed by an alleged artificial deflation
in the price of IBP's stock during the proposed class period. The various
actions were subsequently consolidated under the caption

In re Tyson Foods,
Inc. Securities Litigation

and,

on December 4, 2001, the plaintiffs
in the consolidated action filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint.  On
January 22, 2002, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated
complaint.  By memorandum order dated October 23, 2002, the court granted in
part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss.  On October 6, 2003,
the court certified a class consisting of those who purchased IBP securities on
or before March 29, 2001, and subsequently sold such securities from March 30
through June 15, 2001, inclusive, and sustained damages as a result of such
transaction.    Following the conclusion of discovery in the case, plaintiffs
and defendants each filed motions for summary judgment.  On June 17, 2004, the
court rendered an opinion in favor of defendants and against plaintiffs on all
of plaintiffs' claims, and entered an order to that effect.  On June 28, 2004,
defendants filed a motion requesting the court to modify its order to include
judgment in defendants' favor against the class and on July 30, 2004, the court
entered such an order.  On August 6, 2004, plaintiffs filed a Notice of
Appeal.  No hearing date on the appeal has been set.

General Matters:

In July 1996, certain cattle producers filed

Henry Lee Pickett, et al. v.
IBP, inc.

in the U.S. District Court, Middle District of Alabama,
seeking certification of a class of all cattle producers. The complaint alleged
that TFM used its market power and alleged "captive supply"
agreements to reduce the prices paid by TFM on purchases of cattle in the
cash market in alleged violation of the Packers and Stockyards Act (PSA). 
Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as
actual and punitive damages.  Plaintiffs submitted an amended expert report on
November 19, 2003, showing alleged damages on all cash market purchases by TFM
of approximately $2.1 billion.  Trial of this matter began on January 12,
2004, and concluded on February 10, 2004.  On February 17, 2004, a jury
returned a verdict against TFM on liability and gave an "advisory" verdict on
damages that estimated the impact on the cash market (i.e., a group larger than
the class) to be $1.28 billion.  On February 25, 2004, TFM filed a renewed
motion requesting the Court to enter a judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) for
TFM.  On March 1, 2004, the plaintiffs filed motions asking the Court to enter
the $1.28 billion advisory verdict as an award of damages to the plaintiffs and
requesting prejudgment interest.  On March 22, 2004, the Court denied the
plaintiff's motions for entry of a damages award.  On April 23, 2004, the Court
granted TFM's JMOL motion, and held (i) TFM had legitimate business reasons for
using "captive supplies," (ii) there was "no evidence before the Court to
suggest that [TFM's] conduct is illegal," and (iii) "plaintiffs failed to
present evidence at trial to sustain their burden with respect to liability and
damages."  The plaintiffs have appealed the Court's entry of judgment in favor
of TFM to the 11

th

Circuit Court of Appeals, and oral arguments are
scheduled to be heard by the Circuit Court on December 17, 2004.

On September 12, 2002, 82 individual plaintiffs filed

Michael
Archer, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. and The Pork Group, Inc.

, CIV 2002-497,
in the Circuit Court of Pope County, Arkansas.  On August 18, 2002, the Company
announced a restructuring of its live swine operations which, among other
things, resulted in the discontinuance of relationships with approximately 130
contract hog producers, including the plaintiffs.  In their complaint, the plaintiffs
allege that the Company committed fraud and should be promissorily estopped
from terminating the parties' relationship.  The plaintiffs seek an unspecified
amount of compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorney fees and costs.  The
Company filed a motion to Stay All Proceedings and Compel Arbitration which was
denied.  That decision was appealed to the Arkansas Supreme Court by the
Company and affirmed.  The case was remanded to the Circuit Court and discovery
is proceeding.  Trial is currently scheduled to begin March 25, 2005.



Report Of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Tyson Foods, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Tyson Foods, Inc. as of October 2, 2004, and September 27, 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended October 2, 2004. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item
15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Tyson Foods, Inc. at October 2, 2004, and September 27, 2003, and
the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended October 2, 2004, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects
the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in
2004 the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 03-6, "Participating
Securities and the Two-Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per
Share."

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS
ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

An evaluation was performed, under the supervision and
with the participation of Company management, including the Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) and Interim Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the  Act)).  Based on that evaluation, taking into
account the recent report of the Company's independent public accountants to
the audit committee (the  Audit Committee) of the Company's board of directors
and other reports to the Audit Committee summarized below, management, including
the CEO and CFO, has concluded that, as of October 2, 2004, subject to the 
matters described below, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that
the Company files or submits under the Act has been recorded, processed,
summarized and reported in accordance with the rules and forms of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  In addition, other than the matters
described below, in the fourth fiscal quarter ending October 2, 2004, there has
been no change in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
company's internal control over financial reporting.

As set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report, Ernst
& Young LLP (EY), the Company's independent auditor, issued an
unqualified opinion with respect to the financial statements for the fiscal
year ended October 2, 2004.  The Company is reporting the following five
matters which could be considered significant deficiencies; however,
management and the Audit Committee  do not believe any
of these items (individually, or in the aggregate) constitute a material
weakness of the Company's internal controls:

-      Controls to ensure that changes to
certain applications were properly authorized, tested and approved did not
effectively operate throughout the fiscal year;

-      Access to the Company's financial
system by certain team members was not adequately restricted throughout the
fiscal year;

-      In the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004, the Company implemented additional control procedures that included a
complete physical inventory of all fixed assets at the Company's plant
locations.  Through these procedures the Company identified a write-off of
its fixed assets, and as a result management believes the controls to identify displaced,
idle or retired long-lived assets and record appropriate adjustments to
write-off such assets were not functioning effectively throughout the fiscal
year;

-      A process was not in place during
the fiscal year to ensure impairments of other intangible assets were
identified and recorded in the correct period; and

-      In the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004, as part of a detailed review of the Company's subsidiary in Mexico,
the Company identified internal control deficiencies and recorded a number of
adjustments to the subsidiary's financial statements.  As a result,
management believes oversight and monitoring processes
related to the financial statements of the Company's subsidiary in Mexico did
not function effectively throughout the fiscal year.

Management is in the process of remediating the first
two reportable conditions, including the implementation of controls to ensure
only approved application changes are implemented and to restrict access
appropriately.  The remaining three matters and the remediation plan for such
matters are discussed below:

During the fiscal year, the Company determined that
potentially not all long-lived assets that had been displaced, idle or retired
had been appropriately identified, and therefore, in the fourth quarter ended
October 2, 2004, implemented additional controls that included a complete
physical inventory of all fixed assets at the Company's plant locations.  This
process was designed to identify displaced, idle or retired assets not
otherwise identified, and resulted in a pretax charge in the fourth quarter of
approximately $21 million to write-off such items.  Beginning in fiscal 2005,
this fixed asset inventory process will be repeated annually to ensure that all
displaced, idle or retired fixed assets have been identified and recorded
timely as such in the Company's financial statements.

During the fiscal quarter ended October 2, 2004, the Company
identified trademarks, patents and customer contracts that either the
anticipated fair value had declined or were no longer in use resulting in an
impairment of $25 million, most of which resulted from the Company's declining
use of regional brands and increased use of national brands.  Beginning in
fiscal 2005, a process will be implemented whereby a review of other intangible
assets is periodically performed to ensure that all impairments of intangible
assets have been identified and recorded timely as such in the Company's
financial



statements.

During the fiscal quarter ended October 2, 2004, the Company
conducted a detailed financial review of the Company's Mexican subsidiary, Tyson
de Mexico (TdM), related to TdM's third quarter financial
statements.  The Company's review identified internal control deficiencies in
most financial statement line items.  Although a number of adjustments were
recorded, the net of all pretax adjustments was less than $500,000 and one
adjustment resulting in a $16 million reduction in deferred tax expense was
also recorded in TdM's fourth quarter financial statements.  The Company has
initiated activities to remediate the internal control issues identified at TdM
including, but not limited to, adding certain accounting personnel that have
more experience in financial accounting and reporting than such personnel
previously performing these functions; aligning the accounting function at TdM
with the accounting function at the Company's corporate headquarters;
developing and implementing comprehensive accounting and financial reporting
processes; educating employees throughout TdM as to the importance of
compliance with policies and procedures and the significance of a system of
sound internal controls; and implementing additional monitoring controls at the
Company's corporate headquarters with respect to TdM's financial reporting and
accounting processes.

Management and the Audit Committee believe that
neither the matters reflected in the reportable conditions nor the other
deficiencies involving internal control, individually or in the aggregate, had
a material effect on the financial statements of the Company.

ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION

On December 10, 2004, the Company amended the
employment agreements with John Tyson, Richard Bond, and Greg Lee to provide
for the acceleration of vesting of the equity based compensation awards held by
such executive officers upon the occurrence of a change of control of the
Company.  If a change of control occurs, any stock option, restricted stock, or
performance shares that have been previously granted to the executive officer
will vest (to the extent not already vested) sixty days after the occurrence of
the change of control or upon any earlier date after such change of control on
which the executive officer is terminated other than for egregious
circumstances.

A change of control has the meaning given to such term
under the Tyson Foods, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, and generally means the
occurrence of one or more of the following events:

(1)        Any individual, entity or group acquires
beneficial ownership of voting securities of the Company where such acquisition
causes any such person to own twenty-five percent or more of the combined
voting power of the then outstanding voting securities then entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, subject to certain exceptions for
acquisitions of shares directly from the Company and acquisitions by employee
benefit plans sponsored or maintained by the Company or by any corporation
controlled by the Company.

(2)        A merger, consolidation, share exchange,
combination, reorganization or like transaction involving the Company in which
stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such transaction do not own at
least fifty percent of the value or voting power of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of the Company or its successor immediately after such
transaction.

(3)        The sale or transfer (other than as
security for the Company's obligations) of more than fifty percent of the
assets of the Company in a transaction or series of related transactions
occurring within a one year period in which the Company, any corporation
controlled by the Company or the stockholders of the Company immediately prior
to the transaction do not own at least fifty percent of the value or voting
power of the issued and outstanding equity securities of the acquiror
immediately after the transaction.

(4)        The sale or transfer of more than fifty
percent of the value or voting power of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of the Company by its stockholders in a transaction or series of related
transactions occurring within a one year period in which the Company, any
corporation controlled by the Company or the stockholders of the Company
immediately prior to the transaction do not own at least fifty percent of the
value or voting power of the issued and outstanding equity securities of the
acquiror immediately after the transaction.

(5)        Within any twelve-month period the persons
who were directors of the Company immediately before the beginning of such
twelve-month period shall cease to constitute at least a majority of the board
of directors of the Company.



(6)        The dissolution or liquidation of the
Company.

However, for the purpose of the acceleration of vesting of equity
based compensation awards, a change of control shall not include any event as a
result of which one or more of the following persons or entities possess,
immediately after such event, over fifty percent of the combined voting power of
Company or any successor entity: (a) Don Tyson; (b) individuals related to Don Tyson by blood, marriage or adoption,
or the estate of any such individual; or (c) any entity (including, but not
limited to, a partnership, corporation, trust or limited liability company) in
which one or more individuals or estates described in the preceding clauses (a)
and (b) possess over fifty percent of the combined voting power or beneficial
interests of such entity.

Ernst & Young LLP (EY), the Company's
independent public accountant, has recently informed the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), the Company and the Company's Audit Committee that certain non-audit
work performed by EY in China for a subsidiary of the Company, and for a number
of other companies for which EY provides audit services, has raised questions
regarding EY's independence.  From 2002 through June 2004, in the performance
of certain tax calculation and return preparation services for clients in
China, including the Company subsidiary, EY held employment tax related funds
of a de minimis amount and made payment of such funds to the applicable tax
authority in respect of ex-patriot and foreign employees of the clients.  EY
also informed the Company and the Audit Committee that in the performance of
its services for a foreign subsidiary, it assisted in the liquidation of the
subsidiary, held and paid certain de minimis fees to the appropriate
authorities in Barbados, and provided storage for corporate records.   Custody
of the assets of an audit client is not permitted under the auditor
independence rules of Regulation S-X of the SEC.

The Company's Audit Committee and EY have discussed
the impact the providing of these services may have had on EY's independence
with respect to the Company, and the Audit Committee has concluded there has
been no impairment of EY's independence. In making this determination, the
Audit Committee considered the de minimis amount of the funds involved, the
services were administrative in nature and the associated fees over the period
the services were provided (fiscal year 2001 through 2004) were less than
$27,000. The services have been discontinued.
