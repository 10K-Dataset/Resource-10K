PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

General

Tyson Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company or Tyson) produce, distribute and market beef, chicken, pork, prepared foods and related allied products.  The Company commenced business in 1935, was incorporated in Arkansas in 1947, and was reincorporated in Delaware in 1986.  One of the Company's greatest strengths has been its position as the world's number one producer, processor and marketer of chicken.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company acquired IBP, inc. (IBP).  Headquartered in Dakota Dunes, South Dakota, IBP is the world's largest manufacturer of premium fresh beef and pork products.  With the addition of IBP, Tyson is now the world's largest processor and marketer of beef, chicken and pork products.  The Company's goal is to be the primary protein provider for its customers.

Tyson is a totally integrated poultry company.  Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Cobb-Vantress, Tyson is the number
one breeding stock supplier in the world. Tyson invests in breeding stock research and development.  This allows the Company to breed into its flocks the natural characteristics found to be most desirable.  The Company's integrated operations consist of breeding and rearing chickens, as well as the processing, further-processing and marketing of these food products and related allied products, including animal and pet food ingredients.

With the addition of IBP, the Company is now involved in the slaughter of live fed cattle and hogs and fabrication of dressed beef and pork carcasses into primal and sub-primal meat cuts and case-ready products.  In addition, the Company derives value from allied products such as hides and variety meats for sales to further processors.  Through a wholly owned subsidiary, the Company also produces and markets a wide range of value-added, frozen and refrigerated food products.

The Company's products are marketed and sold to national and regional grocery chains, regional grocery wholesalers, meat distributors, clubs and warehouse stores, military commissaries, industrial food processing companies, national and regional chain restaurants or their distributors, international export companies and domestic distributors who service restaurants, foodservice operations such as plant and school cafeterias, convenience stores, hospitals and other vendors. Sales are made by the Company's sales staffs located in Springdale, Arkansas, in regions throughout the United States and in several foreign countries. Additionally, sales to the military and a portion of sales to international markets are made through independent brokers and trading companies.

Description

As a result of the IBP acquisition, the Company became the world's largest protein provider which resulted in a change in the composition of the Company's reportable segments.  The Company operates in five business segments: Beef, Chicken, Pork, Prepared Foods and Other.

Beef

The Company's beef operations are primarily involved in the slaughter of live fed cattle and fabrication of dressed beef carcasses into primal and sub-primal meat cuts and case-ready products.  Throughout production, edible beef and allied products, such as variety meat items, are segregated and prepared for shipment or further refinement.  Inedible beef products derived from processing operations are used in the manufacture of pet foods, technical products, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.


Nine of IBP's fed beef plants include hide treatment facilities.  The uncured hides from IBP's other fed beef plants are transported to these facilities, which include brine curing operations and, in four locations, chrome hide tanneries. The chrome tanning process produces a semi-finished product that is shipped to leather good manufacturers worldwide.  Brine-cured hides are sold to other tanneries.  IBP is the largest chrome tanner of cattle hides in the United States.

Chicken

Originally, the Company was a producer and distributor of fresh chicken.  The Company developed a strategy to reduce the impact of the commodity market of the fresh chicken business through value-enhancement.  As the industry leader in value-enhanced chicken products, the Company utilizes national and regional advertising, special promotions and brand identification, and meets the varying demands of its customers through capital expenditures and strategic acquisitions.  With further-processed chicken products, grain costs as a percentage of total product costs are reduced because of the value added to the products by cutting, deboning, cooking, packaging and/or freezing the chicken.

The Company's chicken business provides a full range of products from raw to fully-cooked, marinated, breaded, glazed or portioned.  In addition to producing products for human consumption, the chicken segment also converts inedible chicken allied products into high-grade pet food and animal feed ingredients.

Pork

With the addition of IBP, the Company's pork operations now involve the slaughter of live hogs and the fabrication of pork and allied products.  The Company's pork facilities produce fresh boxed pork and case-ready products for shipment to customers, as well as pork bellies, hams and boneless picnic meat for shipment to customers who further process the pork into bacon, cooked hams, luncheon meats and sausage items. Throughout production, edible pork and allied products, such as variety meat items, are segregated and prepared for shipment or further refinement.  Inedible pork products derived from processing operations are used in the manufacture of pet foods, technical products, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.  Two of IBP's pork production facilities also have skinning operations.

Additionally, the Company has farrow to finish swine operations, which include genetic and nutritional research, breeding, farrowing and feeder pig finishing and the marketing of live swine to regional and national packers, that are conducted in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma.

Prepared Foods

The Company's Prepared Foods segment includes Mexican Original, Culinary Foods and Mallard's Food Products along with most of IBP's previously reported Foodbrands America group.  These operations process fresh beef, fresh pork, and other raw materials into pizza toppings, branded and processed meats, appetizers, hors d'oeuvres, desserts, ethnic foods, soups, sauces, side dishes and pizza crusts and produce flour and corn tortilla products and specialty pasta and meat dishes, for restaurants, airlines and other major customers

Other

The Company's Other segment primarily includes the supply chain management facilities, which include fresh and frozen distribution systems and the Company's transportation systems, and other corporate groups not identified with specific protein groups.

Raw Materials and Sources of Supply

Beef

The primary raw material used by the Company in its beef operations is live cattle.  The Company does not have facilities of its own to raise cattle in the United States.  However, the Company has entered into various risk-sharing and procurement arrangements with producers that help secure a supply of livestock for daily start-up operations at its facilities.  The Company's Canadian subsidiary, Lakeside, primarily has cattle feeding facilities and a beef carcass production and boxed beef processing facility.  In 2001, Lakeside's feedlots provided approximately 22% of that facility's fed cattle needs.  The Company's primary supply of live cattle is purchased on a daily basis by buyers who are trained to select high quality animals.


Chicken

The primary raw materials used by the Company in its chicken operations consist of live chickens that are raised primarily by independent contract growers.  The Company's vertically-integrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks.  Breeder farms specialize in producing the generations of male and female strains, with the broiler being the final progeny.  The breeder flocks are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced.  The fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce male and female pullets (i.e., the parents).  The pullets are sent to breeder houses, and the resulting eggs are sent to Company hatcheries.  Once the chicks have hatched, they are sent to broiler farms.  There, contract growers care for and raise the chicks according to Company standards and under the supervision of Company technical service personnel until the broilers have reached the desired processing weight.
  The adult chickens are caught and hauled to processing plants.  The finished products are sent to distribution centers and then transported to customers.  Vertically-integrated poultry companies operate their own feed mills to produce scientifically-formulated feeds.  Corn and soybean meal are major production costs in the poultry industry, representing roughly 40% of the cost of growing a chicken.  In addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens, the Company uses cooking ingredients, packaging materials and cryogenic agents.  The Company believes that its sources of supply for these materials are adequate for its present needs and the Company does not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future. While the Company produces substantially all of its inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers, it may also purchase live, ice-packed or deboned chicken to meet production requirements.

Pork

The primary raw material used by the Company in its pork operations is live swine.  Prior to the acquisition of IBP, the Company raised live swine to sell to outside processors.  With the acquisition of IBP, the Company supplied a minimal amount of its live swine for its processing needs.  The majority of the Company's live swine supply is obtained through various procurement arrangements with producers that help secure a supply for daily start-up operations at its facilities.  The Company also employs buyers who purchase hogs on a daily basis, generally a few days before the animals are required for processing.

Prepared Foods

The primary raw materials used by the Company in its prepared foods operations are typically commodity based raw materials, including fresh and frozen beef, chicken and pork, corn, flour and frozen vegetables that can be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers of these raw materials.

Seasonal Demand

The demand for the Company's chicken and beef products generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months.  The Company's pork products experience increased demand during the winter months due to the holiday season and decreased demand during the spring and summer months.  The Company's prepared foods products do not experience seasonal fluctuations.

Customer Relations

No single customer of the Company accounts for more than ten percent of the Company's consolidated revenues.  However, five customers represent approximately 19% of the Beef segment's sales, five customers represent approximately 29% of the Chicken segment's sales, three customers represent approximately 26% of Pork segment's sales and three customers represent approximately 32% of the Prepared Foods segment's sales. The Company believes the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.  Although any extended discontinuance of sales to any major customer could, if not replaced, have an impact on the Company's operations, the Company does not anticipate any such occurrences due to the demand for its products and its ability to obtain new customers.

Backlog of Orders

There is no significant backlog of unfilled orders for the Company's products.


Competition

The Company's food products compete with those of other national and regional food producers and processors and certain prepared food manufacturers, namely, ConAgra Inc., Pilgrims Pride Corp., Cargill Inc., Sanderson Farms Inc., Smithfield Foods Inc. and Hormel Foods Corp.  Additionally, the Company's food products compete in international markets around the world.  The Company's principal marketing and competitive strategy is to identify target markets for value-enhanced products, to concentrate production, sales and marketing efforts in order to appeal to and enhance the demand from those markets and, utilizing its national distribution system and customer support services, to achieve a dominant market position for its products.  Past efforts have indicated that customer demand generally can be increased and sustained through application of the Company's marketing strategy, as supported by its distribution system.  The principal competitive elements are brand identification, price, product quality,
 and customer service.

International

The Company exported to over 100 foreign countries in fiscal 2001.  Major export markets include Canada, China, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Russia and South Korea.

The Company continues to believe that Asia offers potential in terms of developing processing facilities. The Company recently entered into a joint venture in China to further process U.S. produced chicken. The Company's joint venture, to create a commercial feed and swine operation in the Philippines, called Fil-Am Foods, Inc., with Aboitiz Equity Ventures, Inc. and PM Nutrition Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Purina Mills, Inc., has been operational since 1999.  Meanwhile, the Company's subsidiary in Mexico continues to grow rapidly under improving economic conditions.  The Company has entered into a technical service agreement with Grupo Melo in Panama to assist Grupo Melo with the production of further processed chicken products and allowing them to license the Tyson brand.  Additionally, Cobb-Vantress, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, has entered into a joint venture agreement with a company to build a 180 thousand capacity chicken breeder far
m in China.  With the acquisition of IBP, the Company now has two other joint ventures in China, including one that processes pork casings and one that is a pork processing plant.  The Company also has an equity interest in a Russian meat processing plant and a cooked meats facility in Ireland.

Research and Development

The Company conducts continuous research and development activities to improve the strains of primary chicken breeding stock, the genetic qualities of swine, and finished product development. Additionally, the Company strives to develop ways to automate manual processes in its processing plants and growout operations.  The annual cost of such research and development programs is less than one percent of total consolidated annual sales.

Regulation

The Company's facilities for processing beef, chicken, pork and prepared foods and for housing live chicken and swine are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment, including provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, and to the health and safety of its employees. The Company's beef, chicken, pork and prepared foods processing and distribution facilities are also subject to extensive inspection and regulation by the United States Department of Agriculture. Additionally, the Company's beef, chicken and pork processing facilities are participants in the government's Hazardous Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) program. The cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect upon the Company's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position and it is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future.  In 2001, the Company incurred expenses of approximately 
$68 million to maintain compliance with such regulations.  These expenditures relate principally to the normal operation and maintenance of wastewater treatment facilities ("Waste Treatment Facilities"), where the Company biologically treats these wastes, and the associated land application of wastes generated at these treatment facilities.

Except as disclosed in Item 3, the Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations and the Company is not aware of any violations of, or pending


changes in, such laws and regulations that are likely to result in material penalties or material increases in compliance costs.  The Company incurred $9 million in capital expenditures, primarily related to its Wastewater Treatment Facilities, in fiscal 2001 and anticipates capital expenditures of approximately $45 million in fiscal 2002 for environmental projects primarily related to the Wastewater Treatment Facilities.

Employees and Labor Relations

As of November 30, 2001, the Company employed approximately 124,000 persons. The Company believes that its relations with its workforce are good.

Marketing and Distribution

The Company's principal marketing objective is to be the primary protein provider for our customers.  The Company identifies distinct markets and business opportunities through extensive consumer and market research.  The company's national branding strategy focuses on the Tyson (chicken) and Thomas E. Wilson (red meat) brands.  Additionally, a number of strong regional brands are also supported.  All communications stress the quality and value proposition of the products while supporting and building brand awareness. Communications efforts utilize a fully integrated and coordinated mix of activities designed to connect with customers and consumers on both a rational and emotional level.  The Company utilizes its national distribution system and customer support services to achieve a dominant market position for its products.

The Company's nationwide distribution system utilizes a network of food distributors which is supported by cold storage warehouses owned or leased by the Company, by public cold storage facilities and by the Company's transportation system. The Company ships products from Company-owned consolidated frozen food distribution centers, from a network of public cold storages, from other owned and leased facilities and directly from plants.  The Company's distribution centers facilitate accumulating frozen products so that it can fill and consolidate less-than-truckload orders into full truckloads, thereby decreasing shipping costs while increasing customer service. In addition, customers are provided with a selection of products that do not require large volume orders. The Company's distribution system enables it to supply large or small quantities of products to meet customer requirements anywhere in the continental United States.


Patents and Trademarks

The Company has registered a number of trademarks relating to its products which either have been approved or are in the process of application.  Because the Company does a significant amount of brand name and product line advertising to promote its products, it considers the protection of such trademarks to be important to its marketing efforts. The Company has also developed non-public proprietary information regarding its production processes and other product-related matters.  The Company utilizes internal procedures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality of such information, and where appropriate, seeks patent protection for the technology it utilizes.

Industry Practices

The Company's agreements with its customers are generally short-term, verbal agreements due primarily to the nature of its products, industry practice and the fluctuation in demand and price for such products.

Beef

The Company's beef operations consist of 14 beef production facilities and a Canadian cattle feeding operation.  These facilities slaughter live cattle, fabricate beef products and treat and tan hides.  In addition, one of the beef facilities contains a tallow refinery and one facility shares operations with the Pork segment.  The carcass facilities reduce live cattle to dressed carcass form.  Fed beef consists primarily of young steers and heifers specifically raised for beef consumption.  The processing facilities conduct fabricating operations to produce boxed beef and manufacture allied products such as pet foods, technical products, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.  The processing facilities operated in 2001 at approximately 87% of their production capacities.  The total slaughter capacity is approximately 240,000 head per week.


Chicken

The Company's chicken operations consist of 62 processing plants.  These plants are devoted to various phases of slaughtering, dressing, cutting, packaging, deboning or further-processing.  The total slaughter capacity is approximately 49 million head per week.  In addition, the Company owns 13 rendering plants with the capacity to produce 28 million pounds of animal protein products per week and 18 ground pet food processing operations in connection with chicken processing plants capable of producing 8 million pounds of product per week.  In addition, there are two blending mill operations, 39 feed mills and 76 broiler hatcheries with sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the chicken growout operations.  During 2001, the feed mills operated at 75% of capacity and the hatcheries operated at 85% of capacity.  In general, the remaining processing plants are fully utilized.

Pork

The Company's pork operations consist of seven pork production facilities that slaughter live hogs, fabricate pork products and manufacture allied products such as pet foods, technical products, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.  One of these facilities is shared with the Beef segment.  The processing facilities operated in 2001 at approximately 82% of their production capacities.  The total slaughter capacity of these facilities is approximately 410,000 head per week.  In addition, the Company has swine growout operations that consist of 150 swine farrowing and nursery units and 261 swine finishing units.  The Company also purchases live swine from contract growers.  The swine growout operations are supported by one dedicated feed mill supplemented by the production from the chicken operations' feed mills.

Prepared Foods

The Company's prepared foods operations consist of 45 processing plants which process fresh beef, pork, chicken and other raw materials into pizza toppings, branded and processed meats, appetizers, hors d'oeuvres, desserts, ethnic foods, soups, sauces, side dishes and pizza crusts, flour and corn tortilla products and specialty pasta and meat dishes.  These processing plants have the capacity to produce approximately 60 million pounds per week and operated in 2001 at approximately 77% of capacity.

Other

The Company's other operations consist of two warehouses and 11 freezers used by the beef and pork divisions, 43 cold storage facilities at chicken processing plants, three cold storage facilities at chicken rendering plants, five cold storage facilities used by prepared foods plants, five distribution centers used by the chicken division and five distribution centers used by the prepared foods division with a total capacity of approximately 300 million pounds.

The Company owns its major operating facilities with the following exceptions: one chicken primary processing plant is leased until 2003, one chicken emulsified plant is leased month to month, one chicken distribution center is leased until 2003, one feedmill and three hatcheries are leased until 2003, one hatchery is leased month to month, 386 chicken breeder farm houses are leased under agreements expiring at various dates through 2003 and four chicken breeder farm houses are leased month to month, 30 broiler farms are leased year to year, 68 swine farrowing and nursery units and 210 swine finishing units are leased, with the majority expiring in 2002, one prepared foods distribution center is leased month to month, two prepared foods further processing facilities are leased until 2004 and 2005, and two prepared foods appetizer manufacturing facilities are leased until 2003 and 2013.

Management believes that the Company's present facilities are generally adequate and suitable for its current purposes.  However, seasonal fluctuations in inventories and production may occur as a reaction to market demands for certain products.  The Company regularly engages in construction and other capital improvement projects intended to expand capacity and improve the efficiency of its processing and support facilities.


ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is involved in various lawsuits and claims made by third parties on an ongoing basis as a result of its day-to-day operations. Although the outcome of such items cannot be determined with certainty, the Company's general counsel and management are of the opinion that the final outcome should not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial position.

Wage and Hour/ Labor Matters

On June 22, 1999, 11 current and former employees of the Company filed the case of

M.H. Fox, et al. v. Tyson

Foods, Inc. (Fox v. Tyson)

in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama claiming the Company violated requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The suit alleges the Company failed to pay employees for all hours worked and/or improperly paid them for overtime hours. The suit generally alleges that (1) employees should be paid for time taken to put on and take off certain working supplies at the beginning and end of their shifts and breaks and
(2) the use of "mastercard" or "line" time fails to pay employees for all time actually worked. Plaintiffs seek to represent themselves and all similarly situated current and former employees of the Company. At
filing 159 current and/or former employees consented to join the lawsuit and, to date, approximately 5,000 consents have been filed with the court. Discovery in this case is ongoing. A hearing was held on March 6, 2000, to consider the plaintiff's request for collective action certification and court-supervised notice. No decision has been rendered. The Company believes it has substantial defenses to the claims made and intends to vigorously defend the case; however, neither the likelihood of unfavorable outcome nor the amount of ultimate liability, if any, with respect to this case can be determined at this time.

Substantially similar suits have been filed against several other integrated poultry companies. In addition, organizing activity conducted by representatives or affiliates of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union against the poultry industry has encouraged worker participation in

Fox v. Tyson

and the other lawsuits.

On February 9, 2000, the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) began an industry-wide investigation of poultry producers, including the Company, to ascertain compliance with various wage and hour issues. As part of this investigation, the DOL inspected 14 of the Company's processing facilities. The Company has had discussions with the DOL regarding its investigation and the possible resolution of potential claims that might be asserted by the DOL.

On August 22, 2000, seven employees of the Company filed the case of

De Asencio v. Tyson Foods, Inc.

in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. This lawsuit is similar to

Fox v. Tyson

in that the employees claim violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act for allegedly failing to pay for time taken to put on, take off and sanitize certain working supplies. Plaintiffs seek to represent themselves and all similarly situated current and former employees of the poultry processing plants in New Holland, Pennsylvania. Currently, there are approximately 500 additional current or former employees who have filed consents to join the lawsuit. The
court, on January 30, 2001, ordered that notice of the lawsuit be issued to all potential plaintiffs at the New Holland facilities, but the class has not been ordered certified. The Company believes it has substantial defenses to the claims made and intends to defend the case vigorously; however, neither the likelihood of unfavorable outcome nor the amount of ultimate liability, if any, with respect to this case can be determined at this time.

On November 5, 2001, a lawsuit entitled

Maria Chavez, et.al. vs. IBP, Lasso Acquisition Corporation and

Tyson Foods, Inc.

was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington against IBP and Tyson by several employees of IBP's Pasco, Washington, beef slaughter and processing facility alleging various violations of both the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. Sections 201 - 219 (FLSA) claims, as well as violations of the Washington State Minimum Wage Act, RCW chapter 49.46, Industrial Welfare Act, RCW chapter 49.12, and the Wage


Deductions-Contribution-Rebates Act, RCW chapter 49.52.  The lawsuit alleges IBP and/or Tyson required employees to perform unpaid work related to the donning and doffing of certain personal protective clothing, both prior to and after their shifts, as well as during meal periods.  Plaintiffs further allege that similar prior litigation entitled

Alvarez et. al.  vs. IBP

which resulted in a $3.1 million final judgment against IBP, supports a claim of collateral estoppel and/or is res judicata as to the issues raised in this new litigation.

On January 26, 2000, a lawsuit entitled

Jose Jairo Gutierrez, et. al. vs. Specialty Brands, Inc. and Foodbrands

America, Inc.

was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico by 14 employees at the Specialty Brands' Albuquerque facility alleging violations of both the FLSA and the New Mexico wage and hour statutes.  Initially, these plaintiffs sought to certify a class of all Foodbrands and Specialty Brands employees, but were allowed by the court to certify only a class of hourly production employees in Albuquerque.  The complaint alleges that Specialty Brands failed to compensate employees for walking to and from their work stations and putting on and taking off protective clothing such as smocks, hard hats, hairnets and earplugs.

Environmental Matters

On January 15, 1997, the Illinois EPA brought suit in the Circuit Court for the 14th Judicial Circuit, Rock Island, Illinois, Chancery Division against IBP at its Joslin, Illinois, facility alleging that IBP's operations at its Joslin, Illinois, facility are violating the "odor nuisance" regulations enacted in the State of Illinois. IBP has already completed additional improvements at its Joslin facility to further reduce odors from this operation, but denies Illinois EPA's contention that its operations at any time amounted to a "nuisance". IBP is in the midst of discussions aimed at a complete resolution of these issues, and reports this issue solely because of a recent determination that the penalties have the potential to exceed $100,000.

On January 12, 2000, The U.S.  Department of Justice (DOJ), on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), filed a lawsuit against IBP in U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska, alleging violations of various environmental laws at IBP's Dakota City facility. This action alleges, among other things, violations of: (1) the Clean Air Act; (2) the Clean Water Act; (3) the Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); (4) the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA); and (5) the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA).   IBP determined to reserve $3.5 million during 1999 for the claims raised in this lawsuit based upon the evaluation of a confidential settlement demand received from the DOJ, and review and evaluation of the resolution of comparable claims, in light of the company's assessment of the facts as known to the company and the legal theories advanced by the DOJ. On Oc
tober 12, 2001, a Second and Final Partial Consent Decree was lodged with the U.S. District Court, which, combined with a Partial Consent Decree entered on May 19, 2000, would fully and finally resolve all allegations raised in this lawsuit for a total civil penalty of $4.1 million.  In addition, pursuant to the Second and Final Partial Consent Decree, IBP agreed to make additional wastewater improvements at its Dakota City facility including the installation of a full nitrification system.  On the same date, an amended complaint was filed adding Clean Water Act and RCRA allegations involving IBP's former Palestine, Texas,   facility, Clean Water Act allegations involving IBP's Gibbon, Nebraska, facility, as well as EPCRA/CERCLA alleged violations for other IBP facilities located in Region VII.  These issues are fully resolved in the Second and Final Partial Consent Decree proposed to the
court.  Also on the same date, a separate administrative consent agreement with EPA was entered resolving alleged EPCRA/CERCLA claims at IBP's Joslin, Illinois, facility for a $200,000 civil penalty.  Notice of the Second and Final Partial Consent Decree was published in the Federal Register on November 15, 2001, for a 30-day comment period.  After completion of the comment period, it is anticipated that the Second and Final Partial Consent Decree will be approved and entered by the U.S. District Court in Nebraska, which will end this litigation.

On October 23, 2001, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the District Court for Mayes County, Oklahoma, against Tyson Foods, Inc. by R. Lynn Thompson and Deborah S. Thompson on behalf of all owners of Grand Lake O' the Cherokee's littoral (lake front) property.  The suit alleges that the Company "or entities over which it has operational


control" conduct operations in such a way as to interfere with the putative class action plaintiffs' use and enjoyment of their property, allegedly caused by diminished water quality in the lake.  On November 1, 2001, the suit was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma.  To date, the court has taken no action.  The Company believes that the allegations in the complaint are unfounded and intends to vigorously defend the case.

The Company has been advised by the U.S. Attorney's office for the Western District of Missouri that the government intends to seek an indictment of the Company for alledged violations of the Clean Water Act related to activities at its Sedalia, Missouri, facility.  The Company is presently discussing the possible resolution of this matter but neither the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome nor the amount of ultimate liability, if any, with respect to this matter can be determined at this time.

Securities Matters

In February 2000, several lawsuits were filed against IBP by certain shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska seeking to certify a class of all persons who purchased IBP stock between March 25, 1999, and January 12, 2000. The complaints allege that IBP violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and claims IBP issued materially false statements about the company's compliance with environmental laws in order to inflate the company's stock price.  On February 14, 2001, lead plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend the amended consolidated complaint to add additional claims on behalf of all persons who purchased IBP stock between March 25, 1999, to January 25, 2001. The proposed new claims are substantially similar to those alleged in the South Dakota and New York actions described below under the heading Securities Litigation re: Earnings Restatement, alleging that IBP vio
lated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and rule 10b-5 thereunder. On May 21, 2001, the Magistrate Judge issued two opinions recommending
(1) the denial of plaintiffs request to amend the amended consolidated complaint, and
(2) dismissal of the complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim. Plaintiffs' appeal to the District Court judge was denied, and a final judgment was entered dismissing the case.  Plaintiffs appealed the decision, but on November 7, 2001, signed a Stipulation of Dismissal of Appeal, dismissing their appeal, with prejudice.

Between January and March 2001, a number of lawsuits were filed by certain shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota and one suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to certify a class of all persons who purchased IBP stock between February 7, 2000, and January 25, 2001. The plaintiff in the New York action has voluntarily dismissed and refiled its complaint in South Dakota. The complaints, seeking unspecified damages, allege that IBP and certain members of management violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and claims IBP issued materially false statements about the company's financial results in order to inflate the company's stock price.  IBP intends to vigorously contest these claims.

On or about June 6, 2001, IBP was advised the SEC has commenced a formal investigation of IBP related to the restatement of earnings made by IBP in March 2001.  The investigation appears to relate primarily to certain improprieties in the financial statements of its DFG
subsidiary which resulted in this restatement.

IBP Stockholder and Merger Agreement Related Litigation

Between October 2 and November 1, 2000, 14 class actions were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the Delaware Court) against IBP, inc. (IBP) and the members of the IBP Board of Directors. On November 13, 2000, these actions were consolidated as In re IBP, inc. Shareholders Litigation, C.A. No. 18373 (the Consolidated Action).

On March 29, 2001, the Company filed an action in the Chancery Court of Washington County, Arkansas, entitled

Tyson Foods, Inc. et al. v. IBP, inc.,

Case No. E 2001-749-4 (the Arkansas Lawsuit), alleging that the Company had


been inappropriately induced to enter into the Merger Agreement dated January 1, 2001, (the Merger Agreement) and that IBP was in breach of various representations and warranties made in the Merger Agreement.

On March 30, 2001, IBP filed an answer to the amended consolidated complaint and a cross-claim (amended on April 2, 2001) against the Company in the Consolidated Action. As amended, IBP's cross-claim sought a declaration that the Company could not rescind or terminate the Merger Agreement, specific enforcement of the Merger Agreement and damages for breach of a Confidentiality Agreement.

Following expedited discovery, the Delaware Court conducted a nine day trial, beginning on May 14, 2001, on IBP's and the plaintiffs' claims for specific performance with respect to the Terminated Cash Tender Offer and the Merger Agreement and the Company's counterclaims. On June 15, 2001, following expedited post-trial briefing, the Delaware Court issued a memorandum opinion, which was issued in revised form on June 18, 2001 (the Post-Trial Opinion), in which the Delaware Court concluded, among other things, that (1) the Merger Agreement is a valid and enforceable contract that was not induced by any material misrepresentation or omission, (2) the Company did not breach the Merger Agreement or any duty to IBP's stockholders by failing to close the Terminated Cash Tender Offer, (3) the Company did not have a basis to terminate the Merger Agreement under its terms, and (4) specific performance of the Merger Agreement was the only method by which to
 adequately redress the harm threatened to IBP and its stockholders.

After negotiations and in accordance with the Post-Trial Opinion, the Company and IBP presented an Order, Judgment and Decree to the Delaware Court, entered on June 27, 2001, requiring the Company and its affiliates to specifically perform the Merger Agreement as modified by, and subject to the conditions contained in, the Stipulation, including making this Offer and effecting the Merger.

On August 3, 2001, the Delaware Court entered an order approving the settlement of the Consolidated Action and extinguished all claims that were or could have been asserted in the Consolidated Action in exchange for, among other things, the acceleration of the closing of a new Cash Tender Offer to August 3, 2001.

On June 19, 2001, a purported Company stockholder, commenced a derivative action in the Delaware Court entitled

Alan Shapiro v. Barbara R. Allen, et al.,

C.A. No. 18967-NC seeking monetary damages on behalf of the Company, a nominal defendant, from the members of the Company's Board of Directors. The complaint alleges that the directors violated their fiduciary duties by attempting to terminate the Merger Agreement. The defendants intend to vigorously defend these claims and, on July 17, 2001, moved to dismiss the complaint. A briefing schedule for that motion has not yet been set.

Between June 22 and July 20, 2001, various plaintiffs commenced actions against the Company, Don Tyson, John Tyson and Les Baledge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, seeking monetary damages on behalf of a purported class of those who sold IBP stock or traded in certain IBP options from March 29, 2001, when the Company announced its intention to terminate the
Merger Agreement with IBP, and June 15, 2001, when the Delaware Court rendered its Post-Trial Opinion in the Consolidated Action. The actions, entitled

Meyer v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et al.

, C.A. No. 01-425 SLR;

Banyan Equity Mgt. v. Tyson

Foods, Inc. et al.,

C.A. No. 01-426 GMS;

C.A. No. 01-496; and

Stark Investments, L.P. et al. v. Tyson et al

., C.A. No. 01-565 allege that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making, or causing to be made, false and misleading statements in connection with the Company's attempted termination of the Merger Agreement. The plaintiffs allege that, as a result of the defendants' alleged conduct, the purported clas
s members were harmed. The defendants intend to vigorously defend these claims.


General Matters

In July 1996, a lawsuit was filed against IBP by certain cattle producers in the U.S. District Court, Middle District of Alabama, seeking certification of a class of all cattle producers. The complaint alleges that IBP has used its market power and alleged "captive supply" agreements to reduce the prices paid to producers for cattle. Plaintiffs have disclosed that, in addition to declaratory relief, they seek actual and punitive damages. The original motion for class certification was denied by the District Court; plaintiffs then amended their motion, defining a narrower class consisting of only those cattle producers who sold cattle directly to IBP from 1994 through the date of certification. The District Court approved this narrower class in April 1999. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court decision to certify a class, on the basis that there were inherent conflicts amongst class members preventing the named plaintiffs from providing a
dequate representation to the class. The plaintiffs then filed pleadings seeking to certify an amended class. The Court denied the plaintiffs' motion on October 17, 2000. Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the judge's decision was denied, and plaintiffs now seek to certify a class of cattle producers who have sold exclusively to IBP on a cash market basis. This motion, as well as the company's motions for summary judgment on both liability and damages, is now pending. Management continues to believe that the company has acted properly and lawfully in its dealings with cattle producers.

On August 8, 2000, the Company was served with a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona styled

Lemelson Medical, Education & Research Foundation, Limited Partnership v.

Alcon Laboratories, et al.,

CIV00-0661 PHX PGR. The plaintiff sued the Company, along with approximately 100 other defendants in the food, beverage, drug, cosmetic and tobacco industries, claiming that the defendants infringed various patents held by the Foundation. The alleged patent infringement is based on the defendants' use of the Foundation's automatic identification patents that relate to the use of bar coding and/or the Foundation's patents that relate to machine vision. The Foundation seeks treble damages for the defendants' alleged infringement. The case is currently stayed pending the resolution of related litigation.

The Company has been indicted in the Eastern District of Tennessee for alleged violations of the Immigration and Naturalization Act at several of the Company's locations. We intend to vigorously defend this matter and believe we have meritorious defenses to the government's theories of recovery. However, the outcome of this matter and any potential liability on the part of the Company cannot be determined at this time.

On October 17, 2000, a Washington County (Arkansas) Chancery Court awarded the Company approximately $20 million in its lawsuit alleging trade secret misappropriation by ConAgra, Inc. and ConAgra Poultry Company. Subsequently, on December 4, 2000, as a result of an opinion issued by the Arkansas Supreme Court, the Chancery Court reversed its finding that the Company's nutrient profile was a trade secret and reversed the jury's $20 million verdict against the ConAgra entities. On January 3, 2001, the Company filed a notice of appeal appealing the Chancery Court's reversal of the trade secret determination and of the jury verdict. This appeal is still pending.
