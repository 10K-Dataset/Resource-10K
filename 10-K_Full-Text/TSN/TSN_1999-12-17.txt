ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

     Tyson  Foods,  Inc. (collectively, with its various subsidiaries,  the
"Company"),  a  fully integrated producer, processor and marketer  of  food
products, commenced business in 1935, was incorporated in Arkansas in 1947,
and was reincorporated in Delaware in 1986.

Financial Information about Segments

     The Company identifies business segments based on the products offered
and  the nature of customers. The five reported business segments in fiscal
1999  were  Food  Service,  Consumer  Products,  International,  Swine  and
Seafood.  The  information  required by Item  1  relating  to  segments  is
incorporated  herein  by  reference to Note 16 of the  Company's  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on pages 53, 54 and 55  of  the
Annual Report and attached as Exhibit 13 to this Report.

General Description of Business

     The Company is a fully integrated producer, processor and marketer  of
a  variety of food products consisting of value-enhanced chicken; fresh and
frozen  chicken; and prepared foods and other products such  as  flour  and
corn tortillas and chips. Additionally, the Company has animal feed and pet
food ingredients operations. The Company's integrated operations consist of
breeding  and  rearing  chickens,  as  well  as  the  processing,   further
processing and marketing of these food products. The Company's products are
marketed and sold to national and regional grocery chains, regional grocery
wholesalers,  warehouse  stores,  military  commissaries,  industrial  food
processing  companies,  national and regional chain  restaurants  or  their
distributors, international export companies and domestic distributors  who
service  restaurants,  food service operations such  as  plant  and  school
cafeterias, convenience stores, hospitals and other vendors. Sales are made
by  the  Company's sales staff as well as through independent  brokers  and
trading companies.

     Originally,  the  Company  was a producer  and  distributor  of  fresh
chicken.  The  Company developed a strategy to reduce  the  impact  of  the
commodity  market  of the fresh chicken business through value-enhancement.
As  the  industry  leader in value-enhanced chicken products,  the  Company
utilizes  national and regional advertising, special promotions  and  brand
identification,  and  meets the varying demands of  its  customers  through
capital  expenditures  and strategic acquisitions.  With  further-processed
chicken  products, grain costs as a percentage of total product  costs  are
reduced  because  of the value added to the products by cutting,  deboning,
cooking, packaging and/or freezing the chicken.












The  Company's  integrated  chicken  processes  include  genetic  research,
breeding,   hatching,  rearing,  ingredient  procurement,   feed   milling,
veterinary  and  other technical services, and related  transportation  and
delivery  services.  The  Company contracts  with  independent  growers  to
maintain the Company's flocks of breeder chicks which, when grown, lay  the
eggs  which the Company transfers to its hatcheries and hatch into  broiler
chicks.  Newly hatched broiler chicks are vaccinated and then  delivered to
independent contract growers who care for and feed the broiler chicks until
they  reach  processing weight, usually from the end of the fourth  to  the
eighth  week.  During  the  broiler growout period,  the  Company  provides
growers with feed, vitamins and medication for the broilers, if needed,  as
well   as  supervisory  and  technical  services.  The  broilers  are  then
transported  by  the Company to its nearby processing plants.  The  Company
processed  approximately  7.2 billion pounds  of  consumer  chicken  during
fiscal 1999.

     The  Company's chicken business consists of the Food Service, Consumer
Products  and International segments.  Food Service includes fresh,  frozen
and value-enhanced chicken products sold through food service and specialty
distributors  who  deliver  to  restaurants, schools  and  other  accounts.
Consumer Products include fresh, frozen and value-enhanced chicken products
sold  through retail markets for at-home consumption and through  wholesale
club  markets  targeted  to small food service operators,  individuals  and
small  businesses.  The Company's International segment markets  and  sells
the full line of Tyson chicken products.

     The Company's farrow to finish swine operations, which include genetic
and  nutritional research, breeding, farrowing and feeder pig finishing and
the   marketing  of  live  swine  to  regional  and  national  packers  and
processors,  are conducted in Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri,  North  Carolina
and  Oklahoma. The Company sold approximately 2 million head of feeder pigs
and market weight live swine in fiscal 1999.

      On  September 28, 1999, the Company signed a letter of intent to sell
its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Pork Group, Inc. to Smithfield Foods, Inc.
This  transaction was subject to the successful negotiation of a definitive
agreement.   On December 6, 1999, the Company announced that  both  parties
were  unable to reach a definitive agreement and negotiations were mutually
terminated.  The Company intends to explore all options related to the pork
operations,  which  may  include discussions with other  potential  buyers.
Certain  assets  of  The Pork Group with a fair value of approximately  $70
million  are  classified  as  assets  held  for  sale  at  Oct.  2,   1999.
Additionally, at Oct. 2, 1999, the Company accrued expenses related to  the
closure  of  certain  assets not part of the Smithfield  transaction.   The
operating results for the fiscal year ended Oct. 2, 1999, include a  pretax
charge  of  $35.2 million related to the anticipated loss  and  closure  of
these assets.

      The  Company's  seafood business, which was sold on  July  17,  1999,
included  branded surimi-based seafood offerings, such as analog  crabmeat,
lobster,    shrimp   and   scallops   marketed   both   domestically    and
internationally. Note 2: Dispositions and Assets Held for Sale on pages  43
and  44  of  the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of  the  Annual
Report  describes  the  sale of the seafood business  and  is  incorporated
herein by reference.




     The  Company's  other  segment  includes  the  Prepared  Foods  group,
consisting of Mexican Original, Culinary Foods and Mallard's Food Products.
Mexican Original produces flour and corn tortilla products. Culinary  Foods
and  Mallard's Food Products produce specialty pasta and meat  dishes,  for
restaurants, airlines  and other major customers. Additionally,  the  other
segment  includes  the  Company's  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  involved  in
supplying  chicken breeding stock and trading agricultural goods worldwide,
the  Company's  turkey  and  egg products facilities  which  were  sold  on
December  31,  1998, as well as the Company's by-products operations  which
convert  inedible chicken by-products into high-grade pet food  and  animal
feed ingredients.

Sources of Revenue

      The  information  required by Item 1 with respect to  the  amount  or
percentage of total revenue contributed by any class of similar products or
services  which account for 10% or more of consolidated revenue in  any  of
the last three fiscal years is incorporated herein by reference to Note  16
of  the  Company's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing  on
pages  53,  54  and 55 of the Annual Report pursuant to rule  14a-3(b)  and
attached as Exhibit 13 to this report.

Marketing and Distribution

      The  Company seeks to develop and increase the demand for and  market
share  of a product or product line through concentrated national and local
advertising  and other promotional efforts, stressing product  quality  and
brand  identification  and  meeting  specific  customer  requirements.  The
Company's  principal marketing strategy is to identify target  markets  for
value-enhanced food products consisting primarily of chicken  and  tortilla
products. The Company concentrates production, sales and marketing  efforts
in  order  to  appeal  to and enhance the demand from  those  markets.  The
Company  utilizes  its  national distribution system and  customer  support
services  to  achieve  a  dominant market position  for  its  products  and
identifies distinct markets through trade and consumer research.

      The  Company's nationwide distribution system utilizes a  network  of
food  distributors which is supported by cold storage warehouses  owned  or
leased  by  the  Company,  by public cold storage  facilities  and  by  the
Company's  transportation  system. The  Company  ships  products  from  two
Company-owned  major  frozen food distribution  centers  having  a  storage
capacity of approximately 58 million pounds, from a network of public  cold
storages and from other owned or leased facilities or directly from plants.

     The  Company  has a total frozen storage capacity in excess  of  141.4
million  pounds,  excluding public or outside cold storage.  The  Company's
distribution centers accumulate frozen products so that they can  fill  and
consolidate  less-than-truckload  orders  into  full  truckloads,   thereby
decreasing  shipping costs while increasing customer service. In  addition,
customers  are  provided with a selection of products that do  not  require
large volume orders. The Company's distribution system enables it to supply
large  or  small  quantities  of  products to  meet  customer  requirements
anywhere in the continental United States.






     Operators serving chicken products in the food service market  include
commercial  restaurants, business and industry, colleges and  universities,
national  and  regional chains, hotels and lodging, primary  and  secondary
schools,  health  and  elderly care and other food  service  accounts.  The
Company's products are sold through food service and specialty distributors
who deliver to the above listed operators.

     Food  Service  products  are  sold  under  the  following  brands  and
registered  trademarks:  Tyson, Tastybird, McCarty  Foods,  Tyson's  Pride,
Honey  Stung,  Hot  Wings, Wings of Fire, Signature  Specialties  and  Lady
Aster.

     Food   Service   chicken  products  include  individually-quick-frozen
segments (IQ*F), ready-to-cook and fully cooked fried chicken, fully cooked
breaded  and  glazed wings, cooked and ready-to-cook breaded and  unbreaded
tenderloins, breaded and unbreaded patties and chunks (cooked and ready-to-
cook),  oven  roasted  chicken, stuffed breast specialties,  Cornish  hens,
flavor  marinated breasts, fully cooked, diced, pulled and shredded chicken
products, breaded breast and thigh pieces, bites and strips, fast food cut-
up chicken and marinated deli-chicken.

      In  the consumer products market the Company sells a wide variety  of
food products to customers that sell food products for at-home consumption.
These customers include grocery chains, independent grocery stores, grocery
wholesalers,  wholesale  clubs and military commissaries.   Tyson,  Weaver,
Tyson Holly Farms, Delightful Farms, Gold Leaf and Tastybird are registered
trademarks under which the Company sells consumer products.

     Consumer Products include frozen prepared foods consisting of separate
lines of Tyson breaded chicken patties, chunks, fillets and tenders, Weaver
breaded  chicken  tenders, nuggets, patties and fillets, Tyson  and  Weaver
flavored chicken wings, Tyson complete meal kits, individually-quick-frozen
chicken parts and breaded chicken patties and chunks, refrigerated prepared
foods  consisting of separate lines of Tyson roasted ready-to-eat  chicken,
Weaver  deli meats, refrigerated Tyson Holly Farms fresh tray pack  chicken
and frozen and refrigerated Tyson Cornish game hens.

      The  Company's International division markets and sells the full line
of  Tyson  products,  including chicken and  prepared  food  products.  The
International  division  exported to 75 countries  in  fiscal  1999.  Major
markets  include China, Georgia, Guatemala, Japan, Puerto Rico, Russia  and
Singapore as well as certain Middle Eastern and Caribbean countries.

      The  Company continues to believe that Asia offers potential in terms
of   developing  fully  integrated  chicken  facilities.  A  memorandum  of
understanding has been signed with the Kuok Group to explore development of
chicken  production and processing complexes in China. The Company's  joint
venture,  to  create  a  commercial  feed  and  swine  operation   in   the
Philippines,  called  Fil-Am Foods, Inc., with  Aboitiz   Equity  Ventures,
Inc.  and PM Nutrition Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Purina Mills, Inc  is
now operational. Meanwhile, the Company's subsidiary in Mexico continues to
grow  rapidly  under  improving  economic conditions.  Additionally,  Cobb-
Vantress, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, has entered into a joint venture
agreement with a company to build a 180 thousand capacity breeder  farm  in
China.




Raw Materials and Sources of Supply

      The  primary  raw  materials  used by  the  Company  in  its  chicken
operations  consist  of  feed ingredients, cooking  ingredients,  packaging
materials  and cryogenic agents. The Company believes that its  sources  of
supply  for  these  materials are adequate for its present  needs  and  the
Company does not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials  in
the  future. While the Company produces substantially all of its  inventory
of  breeder  chickens and live broilers, it has the capability to  purchase
live, ice-packed or deboned chicken to meet production requirements.

Intellectual Property

      The  Company  has registered a number of trademarks relating  to  its
products  which  either  have  been approved  or  are  in  the  process  of
application.  Because the Company does a significant amount of  brand  name
and  product  line  advertising to promote its products, it  considers  the
protection of such trademarks to be important to its marketing efforts. The
Company has also developed non-public proprietary information regarding its
growout procedures, production processes and other product-related matters.
The  Company  utilizes internal procedures and safeguards  to  protect  the
confidentiality  of such information, and where appropriate,  seeks  patent
protection for the technology it develops.

Seasonal Demand

      The demand for the Company's products generally increases during  the
spring  and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months.
Because  of the somewhat seasonal character of the Company's business,  the
Company  may  increase its finished product inventories during  the  winter
months in anticipation of increased spring and summer demands.

Industry Practices

      The  Company's agreements with its customers are generally short-term
due primarily to industry practice and fluctuations in both industry supply
and consumer demand for such products.

Customer Relations

      No  single customer of the Company accounts for more than ten percent
of the Company's consolidated revenues, and the loss of any single customer
would  not  have  a  material  adverse effect on  the  Company's  business.
However,  two  customers represent approximately 23% of  the  Food  Service
segment's net sales and three customers represent approximately 47% of  the
Consumer   Products   segment's   net   sales.    Although   any   extended
discontinuance of sales to any major customer could, if not replaced,  have
an  impact on the Company's operations, the Company does not anticipate any
such  occurrences  due to the demand for its products and  its  ability  to
obtain new customers.

Backlog of Orders

     There is no significant backlog of unfilled orders for the Company's
products.




Competition

      The Company's food products compete with those of other national  and
regional   food   producers  and  processors  and  certain  prepared   food
manufacturers.  Additionally,  the  Company's  food  products  compete   in
international markets in Europe, South America, Central America and the Far
East.  The  Company's principal marketing and competitive  strategy  is  to
identify   target  markets  for  value-enhanced  products,  to  concentrate
production,  sales and marketing efforts in order to appeal to and  enhance
the  demand  from  those  markets and, utilizing its national  distribution
system and customer support services, to achieve a dominant market position
for  its  products.  Past  efforts  have  indicated  that  customer  demand
generally  can  be  increased  and sustained  through  application  of  the
Company's marketing strategy, as supported by its distribution system.

Research and Development

The  Company  conducts  continuous research and development  activities  to
improve  the  strains  of  primary  chicken  breeding  stock,  the  genetic
qualities  of  swine, and finished product development, and is  continually
engaged  in  experiments  to determine the most  cost  effective  means  of
raising  healthy and wholesome chickens. The annual cost of  such  research
and  development  programs is less than one percent of  total  consolidated
annual sales.

Regulation

      The  Company's facilities for processing chicken and for housing live
chicken and swine are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws
relating  to  the  protection  of  the  environment,  including  provisions
relating  to the discharge of materials into the environment,  and  to  the
health  and  safety  of its employees. The Company's  chicken  and  Mexican
Original  processing  and  distribution  facilities  are  also  subject  to
extensive  inspection  and regulation by the United  States  Department  of
Agriculture. Additionally, the Company's chicken processing facilities  are
participants in the government's Hazardous Analysis Critical Control  Point
(HACCP) program. The cost of compliance with such laws and regulations  has
not  had a material adverse effect upon the Company's capital expenditures,
earnings  or  competitive  position and it is not  anticipated  to  have  a
material adverse effect in the future.

Employees and Labor Relations

     As  of  October  2,  1999, the Company employed  approximately  69,000
persons.  The  Company believes that its relations with its  workforce  are
generally good.

PURPOSE  OF  "SAFE HARBOR" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES  LITIGATION
REFORM ACT OF 1995

      This annual report and other written reports or oral statements  made
from  time  to  time  by  the Company and its representatives  may  contain
forward-looking  statements, including forward-looking statements  made  in
this  report, with respect to their current views and estimates  of  future
economic  circumstances,  industry  conditions,  company  performance   and
financial  results.  These  forward-looking statements  are  subject  to  a
number  of   factors and uncertainties  which  could  cause  the  Company's

revise  any  forward-looking statements based on the occurrence  of  future
events, the receipt of new information or otherwise.

     Among the factors that may affect the operating results of the Company
are  the following:  (i) fluctuations in the cost and availability  of  raw
materials,  such as feed grain costs; (ii) changes in the availability  and
relative  costs of labor and contract growers; (iii) market conditions  for
finished   products,  including  the  supply  and  pricing  of  alternative
proteins; (iv) effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs; (v) the
ability  of  the Company to make effective acquisitions and to successfully
integrate  newly acquired businesses into existing operations;  (vi)  risks
associated  with leverage, including cost increases due to rising  interest
rates;  (vii)  changes  in  regulations  and  laws,  including  changes  in
accounting  standards,  environmental laws, and  occupational,  health  and
safety  laws;  (viii)  access  to  foreign markets  together  with  foreign
economic  conditions, including currency fluctuations; and (ix) the  effect
of, or changes in, general economic conditions.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

      The  Company currently has production and distribution operations  in
the  following  states:  Alabama, Arkansas, California,  Florida,  Georgia,
Illinois,   Indiana,  Kentucky,  Maryland,  Mississippi,  Missouri,   North
Carolina,  Oklahoma,  Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee,  Texas,  and
Virginia.  Additionally,  the  Company,  either  directly  or  through  its
subsidiaries, has facilities in or participates in joint venture operations
in  Argentina,  Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France,  India,  Indonesia,
Ireland,  Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, South Africa, Spain,  the
United Kingdom and Venezuela.

      The  principal  chicken  operations of  the  Company  consist  of  58
processing  plants.  These  plants  are  devoted  to  various   phases   of
slaughtering, dressing, cutting, packaging, deboning or further-processing.
The total slaughter capacity is approximately 47.6 million head per week.

     To support the above facilities the Company operates 43 feed mills and
68  broiler  hatcheries with sufficient capacity to meet the needs  of  the
chicken  growout  operations.  In addition, the Company owns  chicken  cold
storage facilities with a capacity of approximately 135.7 million pounds.




      The  Company's  other operations consist of eight  processing  plants
supported  by  five  additional freezer storage  facilities.  Additionally,
other  operations  include eleven rendering plants  with  the  capacity  to
produce  26.6 million pounds of animal protein products per week  supported
by   three   freezer  facilities.   Nineteen  ground  pet  food  processing
operations  in  connection with chicken processing plants  are  capable  of
producing 7.7 million pounds of product per week.

      The  Company's  swine operations consist of 158 swine  farrowing  and
nursery units and 385 swine finishing units. These swine growout operations
are  supported by three dedicated feed mills supplemented by the production
from  the chicken operations' feed mills. In addition, the Company operates
a grain drying and two storage facilities in support of its swine feed mill
operations.

      The  Company  owns its major operating facilities with the  following
exceptions:  two  chicken slaughter facilities are leased until  2003,  one
chicken  emulsified plant is leased month to month, two  poultry  feedmills
and  two  hatcheries are leased until 2003, 355 breeder  farms  are  leased
under agreements expiring at various dates, 52 swine farrowing and  nursery
units  and  318  swine finishing units are leased under  one  to  ten  year
renewable lease agreements, some of which are related parties.

       Management  believes  that  the  Company's  present  facilities  are
generally  adequate and suitable for its current purposes. In general,  the
Company's facilities are fully utilized. However, seasonal fluctuations  in
inventories  and production may occur as a reaction to market  demands  for
certain  products.   Due to the current oversupply  of  meat  proteins  and
depressed  market conditions and to bring our production and market  demand
in  balance, the Company has planned a reduction in the production of  live
birds  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2000. The Company regularly
engages in construction and other capital improvement projects intended  to
expand  capacity and improve the efficiency of its processing  and  support
facilities.


ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

      On  June  22,  1999, eleven current and/or former  employees  of  the
Company  filed  the case of M.H. Fox, et al. v. Tyson Foods,  Inc.  in  the
United  States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama claiming
that  the Company has violated the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards
Act. The suit alleges that the Company has failed to pay employees for  all
hours worked and/or has improperly paid them for overtime hours.  The  suit
alleges that employees should be paid for the time it takes them to put  on
and  take  off certain working supplies at the beginning and end  of  their
shifts  and breaks.  The suit also alleges that the use of "mastercard"  or
"line"   time  fails  to  pay  employees  for  all  time  actually  worked.
Plaintiffs  purport to represent themselves and a class  of  all  similarly
situated  current  and  former employees of the Company.  A  total  of  159
consents  were filed with the complaint on behalf of persons  to  join  the
lawsuit and, to date, approximately 3,100 consents have been filed with the
court.  This case is still in the preliminary stages.  The Company believes
it  has substantial defenses to the claims made in this case and intends to
vigorously defend the case.  However, neither the likelihood of unfavorable
outcome nor the amount of ultimate liability, if any, with respect to  this
case can be determined at this time.


      On February 20, 1998, the Company and others were named as defendants
in  a  putative class action suit brought on behalf of all individuals  who
sold  beef cattle to beef packers for processing between certain  dates  in
1993 and 1998.  This action, captioned Wayne Newton, et al. v. Tyson Foods,
Inc.,  et  al.,  U.S.  District Court, Northern  District  of  Iowa,  Civil
Action No. 98-30, asserts claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations   statute as well as a common-law  claim    for   intentional
interference  with prospective economic advantage. Plaintiffs  allege  that
the  gratuities  which were the subject of a prior plea  agreement  by  the
Company  resulted in a competitive advantage for chicken products vis-a-vis
beef products.  Plaintiffs request trebled damages in excess of $3 billion,
plus  attorney's  fees and costs. The United States District Court for  the
Northern District of Iowa granted the Company's Motion to Dismiss on  March
26,  1999,  holding  that plaintiffs lacked standing  to  sue.   Plaintiffs
timely  appealed  to  the  United States Court of Appeals  for  the  Eighth
Circuit.  The Company is vigorously contesting this case.  Briefing of  the
appeal  was  completed in August 1999, but no date has been  set  for  oral
argument.

     On  or about July 23, 1998, the Maryland Department of the Environment
(MDE)  filed  a  Complaint for Injunctive Relief  and  Civil  Penalty  (the
Complaint)  against the Company in the Circuit Court of  Worcester  County,
Md.  for  the alleged violation of certain Maryland water pollution control
laws  with  respect to the Company's land application of sludge to  Company
owned  agricultural  land near Berlin, Md. The MDE seeks,  in  addition  to
injunctive and equitable relief, civil penalties of up to $10,000  per  day
for  each  day  the  Company had allegedly operated  in  violation  of  the
Maryland  water  pollution control laws. The Company does not  believe  any
penalties,  if  imposed,  would  have a  material  adverse  effect  on  the
Company's results of operations or financial condition.

     On  December  16, 1998, Hudson Foods, Inc., Michael Gregory,  Hudson's
former Director of Customer Relations and Quality Control, and Brent Wolke,
the  former  plant  manager of Hudson's Columbus, Nebraska  facility,  were
indicted by a federal grand jury in Omaha, Nebraska on two counts -  making
false  statements to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and  conspiracy  to
make  such statements - in connection with the August 1997 recall of Hudson
beef  products  suspected of containing E-Coli 0157:H7.  The charges  arose
out  of  presentations  made  on  behalf  of  Hudson  between  Food  Safety
Inspection   Service  officials  during  Hudson's  cooperation   with   the
government in attempting to identify potentially contaminated product.  The
government  has  conceded that the contamination did not originate  in  the
Hudson  plant  and it does not appear that any statements at issue  in  the
indictment  resulted in or are alleged to have resulted in  any  illnesses.
On  November  30,  1999,  the  Court granted  the  defendants'  motion  for
acquittal  on the conspiracy charges and additionally granted  Mr.  Wolke's
motion  for acquittal on his false statement charge. On December  2,  1999,
Hudson and Mr. Gregory were acquitted on all remaining charges.











     The  Company has received notice from the Environmental Crimes Section
of  the  Department of Justice and the United States Attorney's Office  for
the  Southern District of Mississippi indicating that McCarty  Farms,  Inc.
(McCarty),  a former subsidiary of the Company which has been  merged  into
the  Company,  may be pursued for alleged violations of the  Federal  Clean
Water Act arising out of its partial ownership of Central Industries,  Inc.
(Central),  which  operates a rendering plant in Forest, Mississippi.   The
allegations  arose from the alleged discharge of pollutants from  Central's
rendering facility in Forest, Mississippi in the summer of 1995, which  was
prior  to the Company's purchase of McCarty in September 1995. Neither  the
likelihood of unfavorable outcome nor the amount of ultimate liability,  if
any, with respect to this case can be determined at this time.

                                  PART II

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER
         MATTERS

      The  Company  currently  has issued and outstanding  two  classes  of
capital  stock,  Class A Common Stock (the "Class A  Stock")  and  Class  B
Common Stock (the "Class B Stock"). Information regarding the voting rights
and  dividend  restrictions are set forth on page 43 of the  Annual  Report
under the caption "Capital Stock," which information is incorporated herein
by reference.

      On October 2, 1999, there were approximately 34,828 holders of record
of  the  Company's Class A Stock and 17 holders of record of the  Company's
Class B Stock, excluding holders in the security position listings held  by
nominees. The Class A Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange  under
the symbol "TSN." No public trading market currently exists for the Class B
Stock. Information regarding the high and low closing prices of the Class A
Stock  is set forth on pages 24 and 25 and in the table on page 60  of  the
Annual  Report  under  the  captions "Eleven-Year  Financial  Summary"  and
"Closing   Price   of  Company's  Common  Stock,"  which   information   is

       See  the  information  reflected  under  the  caption  "Management's
Discussion and Analysis" on pages 26 through 37 of the Annual Report, which
information is incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISKS

      Market  risks  relating to the Company's operations result  primarily
from  changes  in  commodity prices, interest rates  and  foreign  exchange
rates,  as  well as credit risk concentrations. To address these risks  the
Company  enters into various hedging transactions as described  below.  The
Company  seldom uses financial instruments which do not qualify  for  hedge
accounting.   In those situations, in which instruments do not qualify  for
hedge  accounting,  the Company marks the instruments  to  fair  value  and
recognizes the gains or losses currently in earnings.







Commodities Risk

      The Company is a purchaser of certain commodities, primarily corn and
soybeans.  The Company periodically uses commodity futures and options  for
hedging purposes to reduce the effect of changing commodity prices and as a
mechanism to procure the grains.  The contracts that effectively meet  risk
reductions  and  correlation criteria are recorded using hedge  accounting.
Gains  and  losses on closed hedge transactions are recorded as a component
of the underlying inventory purchase.

The  following table provides information about the Company's corn, soybean
and  other  feed  ingredient inventory and financial instruments  that  are
sensitive to changes in commodity prices.  The table presents the  carrying
amounts  and  fair  values  at  October  2,  1999  and  October  3,   1998.
Additionally, for puts and futures contracts, the latest which  expires  or
matures  15 months from the reporting date, the table presents the notional
amounts in units of purchase and the weighted average contract prices.

Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risks

      The  Company  also  hedges exposure to changes in interest  rates  on
certain of its financial instruments.  Under the terms of various leveraged
equipment  loans, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements  to
effectively  lock  in  a  fixed interest rate  for  these  borrowings.  The
maturity dates of these leveraged equipment loans range from 2005  to  2008
with interest rates ranging from 4.7% to 6%.

     The  Company  also  periodically enters into foreign exchange  forward
contracts  and  option  contracts to hedge some  of  its  foreign  currency
exposure.  In  1999, the Company used such contracts to hedge  exposure  to
changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  primarily  Mexican  Peso,
associated  with debt denominated in U.S. dollars held by Tyson de  Mexico.
In  1998,  the Company used such contracts to hedge exposure to changes  in
foreign  currency exchange rates, primarily Japanese Yen,  associated  with
sales  denominated in foreign currency. Gains and losses on these contracts
are  recognized  as  an adjustment of the subsequent  transaction  when  it
occurs.   Forward  and  option  contracts  generally  have  maturities   or
expirations not exceeding 12 months.

       The   following  table  provides  information  about  the  Company's
derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments  that  are
sensitive  to  changes  in  interest rates.  The  table  presents  for  the

Credit Risks

     The Company's financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables.
The  Company's cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed  with
major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk  with
respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and
their  dispersion  across geographic areas. The Company  performs  periodic
credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally does
not require collateral. No single group or customer represents greater than
10% of total accounts receivable.
