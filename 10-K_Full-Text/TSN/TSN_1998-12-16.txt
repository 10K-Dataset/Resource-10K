                                  PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

General

      Tyson  Foods,  Inc.  and its various subsidiaries (collectively,  the
"Company")  produce,  market  and distribute a  variety  of  food  products
consisting  of  value-enhanced poultry; fresh and  frozen  poultry;  value-
enhanced  seafood products; fresh and frozen seafood products and  prepared
foods  and  other  products  such as flour and corn  tortillas  and  chips.
Additionally,  the  Company  has  live swine,  animal  feed  and  pet  food
ingredients  operations.  The Company's integrated  operations  consist  of
breeding  and  rearing  chickens,  harvesting  seafood,  as  well  as   the
processing,  further-processing and marketing of these food  products.  The
Company's  products are marketed and sold to national and regional  grocery
chains,  regional grocery wholesalers, clubs and warehouse stores, military
commissaries, industrial food processing companies, national  and  regional
chain restaurants or their distributors, international export companies and
domestic distributors who service restaurants, foodservice operations  such
as  plant  and school cafeterias, convenience stores, hospitals  and  other
vendors.  Sales  are  made  by  the  Company's  sales  staffs  located   in
Springdale,  Arkansas,  in  regions throughout the  United  States  and  in
several  foreign  countries. Additionally, sales  to  the  military  and  a
portion  of  sales  to  international markets are made through  independent
brokers  and trading companies. The Company conducts the major  portion  of
its  business activities on a vertically integrated basis and considers its
business  to be one industry segment, that of "food products." The  Company
commenced business in 1935, was incorporated in Arkansas in 1947,  and  was
reincorporated in Delaware in 1986.

Description

      Originally,  the  Company  was a producer and  distributor  of  fresh
chicken.  The  Company developed a strategy to reduce  the  impact  of  the
commodity  market  of the fresh chicken business through value-enhancement.
As  the  industry  leader in value-enhanced poultry products,  the  Company
utilizes  national and regional advertising, special promotions  and  brand
identification,  and  meets the varying demands of  its  customers  through
capital  expenditures  and strategic acquisitions.  With  further-processed
poultry  products, grain costs as a percentage of total product  costs  are
reduced  because  of the value added to the products by cutting,  deboning,
cooking, packaging and/or freezing the poultry.

















      The  Company's integrated poultry processes include genetic research,
breeding,   hatching,  rearing,  ingredient  procurement,   feed   milling,
veterinary  and  other technical services, and related  transportation  and
delivery  services.  The  Company contracts  with  independent  growers  to
maintain the Company's flocks of breeder chicks which, when grown, lay  the
eggs  which the Company transfers to its hatcheries and hatch into  broiler
chicks.  Newly hatched broiler chicks are vaccinated and then delivered  to
independent contract growers who care for and feed the broiler chicks until
they  reach  processing weight, usually from the end of the fourth  to  the
eighth  week.  During  the  broiler growout period,  the  Company  provides
growers with feed, vitamins and medication for the broilers, if needed,  as
well   as  supervisory  and  technical  services.  The  broilers  are  then
transported  by  the Company to its nearby processing plants.  The  Company
processed  approximately  6.4 billion pounds  of  consumer  poultry  during
fiscal 1998.
                                     
     The Company's farrow to finish swine operations, which include genetic
and  nutritional research, breeding, farrowing and feeder pig finishing and
the marketing of live swine to regional and national packers, are conducted
in  Alabama,  Arkansas, Missouri, North Carolina and Oklahoma. The  Company
sold  approximately 2.0 million head of market weight live swine in  fiscal
1998.

     The  Company is the leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor  of
branded  surimi-based seafood offerings including analog crabmeat, lobster,
shrimp and scallops. Additionally, the Company's seafood operations consist
of  one  of the largest catching and at-sea processing fleets in the  North
Pacific.  These  vessels harvest a wide range of species of bottomfish  and
shellfish  year-round off the coasts of Alaska, Washington and Oregon.  The
catch  is  either processed at sea or in shore-based processing  facilities
into a variety of product forms.

     The  Company's  prepared foods group, consisting of Mexican  Original,
Culinary Foods and Mallard's Food, produce flour and corn tortilla products
and  specialty pasta and meat dishes, for restaurants, airlines  and  other
major customers.

     The  Company's  by-products operations convert  inedible  poultry  by-
products into high-grade pet food and animal feed ingredients.













                                     
                                     
                                     
                                     
                                     

Sources of Revenue

      The  principal  revenue sources of the Company include value-enhanced
poultry  products,  fresh  and  frozen  poultry  products,  prepared   food
products,  frozen dinner products, seafood products, live swine operations,
animal  foods,  by-products, and other products. In the  first  quarter  of
1997,  the  Company sold its beef further-processing plants and closed  its
pork  further-processing  plant. Revenue for 1996  includes  value-enhanced
beef and pork products. The following table sets forth the relative sources
of the Company's revenues for the last three fiscal years.

Marketing and Distribution

      The  Company seeks to develop and increase the demand for and  market
share  of a product or product line through concentrated national and local
advertising  and other promotional efforts, stressing product  quality  and
brand  identification  and  meeting  specific  customer  requirements.  The
Company's  principal marketing strategy is to identify target  markets  for
value-enhanced  food  products consisting primarily  of  poultry,  tortilla
products  and  seafood.  The  Company concentrates  production,  sales  and
marketing  efforts in order to appeal to and enhance the demand from  those
markets. The Company utilizes its national distribution system and customer
support services to achieve a dominant market position for its products and
identifies distinct markets through trade and consumer research.

      The  Company's nationwide distribution system utilizes a  network  of
food  distributors which is supported by cold storage warehouses  owned  or
leased  by  the  Company,  by public cold storage  facilities  and  by  the
Company's  transportation  system. The  Company  ships  products  from  two
Company-owned  major  frozen food distribution  centers  having  a  storage
capacity of approximately 58 million pounds, from a network of public  cold
storages, from other owned or leased facilities or directly from plants.


The Company has a total frozen storage capacity in excess of 132.5 million
pounds,   excluding   public  or  outside  cold  storage.   The   Company's
distribution centers facilitate accumulating frozen products so that it can
fill  and  consolidate  less-than-truckload orders  into  full  truckloads,
thereby  decreasing  shipping costs while increasing customer  service.  In
addition, customers are provided with a selection of products that  do  not
require  large volume orders. The Company's distribution system enables  it
to   supply  large  or  small  quantities  of  products  to  meet  customer
requirements anywhere in the continental United States.

     The Company's food products are sold primarily in three broad domestic
markets  consisting  of  foodservice,  retail  and  wholesale  clubs.   The
foodservice, retail and wholesale club markets may, in some cases, overlap.
The Company's food products are also sold internationally.

      In  the  foodservice market, the Company sells poultry,  seafood  and
tortilla  products.  Operators serving these  products  include  commercial
restaurants,  business/industry,  colleges/universities,  national/regional
chains, hotels/lodging, primary/secondary schools, health/elderly care  and
other  foodservice  accounts.  The  Company's  products  are  sold  through
foodservice  and  specialty distributors who deliver to  the  above  listed
operators.

       Foodservice  products  are  sold  under  the  following  brands  and
registered  trademarks: Tyson, Honey Stung, Tyson's Pride, HoneyBest,  Wing
Stingers,  W.W.  Flyers,  Signature Specialties, Flavor-Redi,  Lady  Aster,
Quality  Cuisine, Our Finest, Mexican Original, McCarty Foods, Louis  Kemp,
Arctic  Ice, Enterprise, Crab Delights, Lobster Delights, Ocean Master  and

snow crab, king crab, pollock, cod and several species of flatfish.

     In the retail market the Company sells a wide variety of food products
to  customers  that  sell  food products for  at-home  consumption.   These
customers  include  grocery store chains, independent  grocery  stores  and
grocery wholesalers.

      Tyson, Weaver, Tyson Holly Farms, Mexican Original, Louis Kemp,  Crab
Delights,  Lobster Delights, JAC Creative Foods, Captain JAC,  SeaFest  and
Mallard's  are registered trademarks under which the Company  sells  retail
products.

      Retail  products  include: (a) frozen prepared  foods  consisting  of
separate  lines  of  Tyson  breaded chicken patties,  chunks,  fillets  and
tenders;  Weaver  breaded chicken tenders, nuggets,  patties  and  fillets;

seafood  products  which are marketed under the Louis Kemp  brand  of  Crab

Captain JAC and SeaFest.

     In the wholesale club market the Company designs and markets a variety
of  products  targeted  to small foodservice operators  and  consumers  who
frequent  club  stores.  These  products  are  aimed  at  both  foodservice
operators who buy in small quantities and want to cut costs of storage  and
final distribution, as well as retail consumers willing to buy larger  than
normal  quantities  to  realize cost savings.  The  Company  sells  several
categories  of  products including: IQF chicken, fresh tray  pack  chicken,
refrigerated  roasted  ready-to-eat chicken,  frozen  value-added  chicken,
canned chicken and surimi-based seafood products.

      The Company's international division markets and sells throughout the
world  the  full line of Tyson products, including poultry,  prepared  food
products  and seafood. The international division exported to 56  countries
in  fiscal  1998. Major markets include Canada, China, Georgia,  Guatemala,
Japan,  Puerto Rico, Russia and Singapore as well as certain Middle Eastern
countries and countries in the Caribbean.

      The  Company continues to believe that Asia offers potential in terms
of   developing  fully-integrated  poultry  facilities.  A  memorandum   of
understanding has been signed with the Kuok Group to explore development of
poultry production and processing complexes in China. The Company has  also
established  a joint venture called Fil-Am Foods, Inc. with Aboitiz  Equity
Ventures,  Inc.  and  PM Nutrition Company, Inc., a  subsidiary  of  Purina
Mills,  Inc.,  to  create  a commercial feed and  swine  operation  in  the
Philippines.  Meanwhile, the Company's joint venture  operation  in  Mexico
continues  to  grow  rapidly  under improving  economic  conditions.  Cobb-
Vantress, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, has entered into a joint venture
agreement with a company to build a 180 thousand capacity breeder  farm  in
China.

Raw Materials and Sources of Supply

      The  primary  raw  materials  used by  the  Company  in  its  poultry
operations  consist  of  feed ingredients, cooking  ingredients,  packaging
materials  and cryogenic agents. The Company believes that its  sources  of
supply  for  these  materials are adequate for its present  needs  and  the
Company does not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials  in
the  future. While the Company produces substantially all of its  inventory
of  breeder  chickens and live broilers, it has the capability to  purchase
live,   ice-packed   or   deboned  poultry  to  meet   poultry   production
requirements.

      In  addition,  raw  material requirements for the  Company's  seafood
operations  are  met  by either purchasing in the open  market  or  by  the
Company's  vessels  harvesting a wide range of species  of  bottomfish  and
shellfish off the coasts of Alaska, Washington and Oregon.   A large supply
of  bottomfish,  one  of the principal groups of fish harvested  for  human
consumption, is found in the 200-mile U.S. exclusive  economic zone off the


coast of Alaska. This area also provides a significant quantity of crab for
commercial  harvesting; however, crab quotas have been severely limited  in
recent  years.  Following passage of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation  and
Management  Act  of 1976 (the "Magnuson Act"), the United  States  extended
control over the management of offshore fishing resources from a 12-mile to
a  200-mile  exclusive  economic zone by, among other things,  establishing
annual catch limits and allocating the available resources between U.S. and
foreign  catchers and processors. As a result of these government  actions,
the Company's ability to harvest seafood is subject to these limitations.

Patents and Trademarks

      The  Company  has registered a number of trademarks relating  to  its
products  which  either  have  been approved  or  are  in  the  process  of
application.  Because the Company does a significant amount of  brand  name
and  product  line  advertising to promote its products, it  considers  the
protection of such trademarks to be important to its marketing efforts. The
Company has also developed non-public proprietary information regarding its
production  processes  and  other  product-related  matters.  The   Company
utilizes  internal procedures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality
of such information, and where appropriate, seeks patent protection for the
technology it utilizes.

Seasonal Demand

      The demand for the Company's products generally increases during  the
spring  and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months.
Because  of the somewhat seasonal character of the Company's business,  the
Company  may  increase its finished product inventories during  the  winter
months in anticipation of increased spring and summer demands.

Industry Practices

      The Company's agreements with its customers are generally short-term,
verbal  agreements  due primarily to the nature of its  products,  industry
practice and the fluctuation in demand and price for such products.

Customer Relations

      No  single customer of the Company accounts for more than ten percent
of the Company's consolidated revenues, and the loss of any single customer
would  not  have  a  material  adverse effect on  the  Company's  business.
Although any extended discontinuance of sales to any major customer  could,
if  not  replaced, have an impact on the Company's operations, the  Company
does not anticipate any such occurrences due to the demand for its products
and its ability to obtain new customers.

Backlog of Orders

     There is no significant backlog of unfilled orders for the Company's
products.

Competition

      The Company's food products compete with those of other national  and
regional   food   producers  and  processors  and  certain  prepared   food
manufacturers. Additionally, the Company's food products compete in


international markets in Europe, South America, Central America and the Far
East.  The  Company's principal marketing and competitive  strategy  is  to
identify   target  markets  for  value-enhanced  products,  to  concentrate
production,  sales and marketing efforts in order to appeal to and  enhance
the  demand  from  those  markets and, utilizing its national  distribution
system and customer support services, to achieve a dominant market position
for  its  products.  Past  efforts  have  indicated  that  customer  demand
generally  can  be  increased  and sustained  through  application  of  the
Company's marketing strategy, as supported by its distribution system.

Research and Development

     The Company conducts continuous research and development activities to
improve  the  strains  of  primary  poultry  breeding  stock,  the  genetic
qualities  of  swine,  and  finished product development.  Additionally,  a
separate  staff  of  research and development personnel  is  maintained  to
develop and provide for product needs. The annual cost of such research and
development programs is less than one percent of total consolidated  annual
sales.

Regulation

      The  Company's facilities for processing poultry and for housing live
poultry and swine are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws
relating  to  the  protection  of  the  environment,  including  provisions
relating  to the discharge of materials into the environment,  and  to  the
health  and  safety  of its employees. The Company's  poultry  and  Mexican
Original  processing  and  distribution  facilities  are  also  subject  to
extensive  inspection  and regulation by the United  States  Department  of
Agriculture. Additionally, the Company's poultry processing facilities  are
participants in the government's pilot Hazardous Analysis Critical  Control
Point  (HACCP)  program.  The  cost  of  compliance  with  such  laws   and
regulations  has  not  had  a material adverse effect  upon  the  Company's
capital  expenditures,  earnings or competitive  position  and  it  is  not
anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future.

      Fishing activities and seafood processing activities of the Company's
seafood operations are closely regulated by the United States Department of
Commerce  and  various  other  state  and  governmental  agencies.    These
agencies,  among  other  things, establish  fishing  seasons  and  resource
depletion  restrictions and regulate legal gear types.  Violations  of  the
Magnuson  Act  and state laws can result in substantial penalties,  ranging
from  fines  to  seizure  of catch and vessels. In  addition,  the  seafood
operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to
the  protection  of  the  environment and the  health  and  safety  of  its
employees.

      To  provide consumer reassurance of product integrity and safety,  to
create a quality point of difference from the competition, and to assume  a
position  of  measured  industry leadership in  production  standards,  the
Company's seafood operation voluntarily complies with certain United States
Department  of  Commerce regulations which enable it  to  show  the  United
States  Department  of  Commerce seal of approval  (PUFI)  on  its  primary
products.  Three of the  Company's  seafood  manufacturing  facilities  are
United States Department of Commerce inspected and are participants in  the
HACCP program.

CAUTIONARY  STATEMENTS  RELEVANT  TO FORWARD-LOOKING  INFORMATION  FOR  THE
PURPOSE  OF  "SAFE HARBOR" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES  LITIGATION
REFORM ACT OF 1995

     The Company and its representatives may from time to time make written
or  oral forward-looking statements with respect to their current views and
estimates  of  future economic circumstances, industry conditions,  company
performance  and  financial results. These forward-looking  statements  are
subject to a  number of  factors and uncertainties  which  could  cause the
Company's  actual  results and experiences to differ  materially  from  the
anticipated  results  and  expectations expressed in  such  forward-looking
statements.  The  Company  wishes to caution readers  not  to  place  undue
reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date
made.

     Among the factors that may affect the operating results of the Company
are  the following:  (i) fluctuations in the cost and availability  of  raw
materials,  such as feed grain costs; (ii) changes in the availability  and
relative  costs of labor and contract growers; (iii) market conditions  for
finished   products,  including  the  supply  and  pricing  of  alternative
proteins; (iv) effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs; (v) the
ability  of  the Company to make effective acquisitions and to successfully
integrate  newly acquired businesses into existing operations;  (vi)  risks
associated  with leverage, including cost increases due to rising  interest
rates;  (vii)  changes  in  regulations  and  laws,  including  changes  in
accounting  standards, environmental laws, occupational, health and  safety
laws, and laws regulating fishing and seafood processing activities; (viii)
access  to  foreign  markets  together with  foreign  economic  conditions,
including  currency fluctuations; and (ix) the effect of,  or  changes  in,
general economic conditions.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

      The  Company currently has production and distribution operations  in
the  following  states:  Alabama,  Alaska, Arkansas,  California,  Florida,
Georgia,  Illinois,  Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland,  Minnesota,  Mississippi,
Missouri,  North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South  Carolina,
Tennessee,  Texas,  Virginia  and Washington.  Additionally,  the  Company,
either  directly  or  through  its  subsidiaries,  has  facilities  in   or
participates  in  joint  venture operations in Argentina,  Brazil,  Canada,
China,  Denmark,  France,  India, Indonesia, Ireland,  Japan,  Mexico,  the
Philippines, Poland, South Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom and Venezuela.

      The  principal  poultry  operations of  the  Company  consist  of  58
processing  plants.  These  plants  are  devoted  to  various   phases   of
slaughtering, dressing, cutting, packaging, deboning or further-processing.
The total slaughter capacity is approximately 43 million head per week.

     To support the above facilities the Company operates 37 feed mills and
65  broiler  hatcheries with sufficient capacity to meet the needs  of  the
poultry  growout  operations.  In addition, the Company owns  poultry  cold
storage facilities with a capacity of approximately 126.8 million pounds.

      The  Company's prepared foods operations consist of eight  processing
plants.   These operations are supported by five additional freezer storage
facilities.



      The  Company's seafood operations consist of 23 catching  and  at-sea
processing  vessels  along with two freighters. The  at-sea  processing  is
supported  by  nine  shore-based  processing  plants,  five  of  which  are
dedicated to surimi processing.

      The  Company's animal feed and pet food processing operations consist
of eleven rendering plants with the capacity to produce 26.6 million pounds
of  animal protein products per week supported by three freezer facilities.
Fourteen  ground pet food processing operations in connection with  poultry
processing  plants are capable of producing 7.3 million pounds  of  product
per week.
                                     
     The Company's live swine operations consist of 158 swine farrowing and
nursery units and 385 swine finishing units. These swine growout operations
are  supported by three dedicated feed mills supplemented by the production
from  the poultry operations' feed mills. In addition, the Company operates
a grain drying and two storage facilities in support of its swine feed mill
operations.

      The Company owns its major operating facilities and vessels with  the
following  exceptions: one poultry emulsified operation  facility  and  one
poultry  emulsified plant are leased month to month, 355 breeder farms  are
leased  under agreements expiring at various dates through 1999,  52  swine
farrowing and nursery units and 318 swine finishing units are leased  under
one  to  ten  year  renewable lease agreements and two  seafood  processing
plants are leased under agreements expiring in 2000 and 2001.

       Management  believes  that  the  Company's  present  facilities  are
generally  adequate and suitable for its current purposes. In general,  the
Company's facilities are fully utilized. However, seasonal fluctuations  in
inventories  and production may occur as a reaction to market  demands  for
certain products.  The Company regularly engages in construction and  other
capital  improvement projects intended to expand capacity and  improve  the
efficiency of its processing and support facilities.


ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

           On  December 29, 1997, the Company entered into a plea agreement
resolving  the Office of Independent Counsel's (OIC) investigation  of  the
Company  in  connection  with  its investigation  of  former  Secretary  of
Agriculture  Michael Espy.  The Company entered a guilty plea to  a  single
count  of  violating  the illegal gratuity statute, 18  U.S.C.   201(c)(1).
The  Company was sentenced on January 12, 1998 to pay a fine of $4 million,
costs  of  prosecution of $2 million and was placed on probation  for  four
years.   At  the  time of its plea, the Company also entered  a  Compliance
Agreement with OIC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture requiring  it  to
implement a compliance program.

           Following  the entry of its guilty plea, the Company and  others
were  named as defendants in a putative class action suit brought on behalf
of  all  individuals  who sold beef cattle to beef packers  for  processing
between  certain  dates  in 1993 and 1998.  This  action,  captioned  Wayne
Newton,  et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et al., U.S. District Court, Northern
District  of  Iowa,  Civil  Action  No. 98-30,  asserts  claims  under  the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations  statute as well as a common
- -law  claim   for  intentional  interference  with   prospective   economic


advantage.  Plaintiffs allege that the gratuities which were the subject of
the Company's plea resulted in a competitive advantage for poultry products
vis-a-vis  beef products.  Plaintiffs request trebled damages in excess  of
$3 billion,  plus attorney's  fees and costs.  While management is not able
at  the  present time to determine the outcome of this matter,  based  upon
information currently available, management presently does not believe that
this  lawsuit has merit and will not have a material adverse effect on  the
Company's financial position or its results of operations.

On  July  28,  1997,  Hudson received notice from the  U.S.  Department  of
Justice  (DOJ) that it was prepared to bring an action against  Hudson  for
the  alleged  violation  of the Clean Water Act at  Hudson's  Berlin,  Md.,
poultry  processing  facility.  The DOJ alleged that  over  the  past  five
years,  Hudson had repeatedly discharged pollutants in quantities in excess
of  its  National  Pollutant Discharge Elimination  System  (NPDES)  permit
limits, violated  monitoring and sampling  requirements of its NPDES permit
and  failed to provide notice of NPDES violations.  On  September 19, 1997,
Hudson  entered  into  an  agreement in principle  with  the  DOJ  for  the
settlement  of these claims.  On May 8, 1998, a Consent Decree between  the
United  States,  Hudson and the Company was filed with  the  U.S.  District
Court together  with a Complaint  alleging these violations. On October  6,
1998, the U.S. District Court approved and entered the Consent Decree.  The
Consent Decree, while stating that Hudson denies the violations alleged  in
the  Complaint, provides for the payment to the United States of $4 million
and  the  expenditure of $2 million in supplemental environmental  projects
(SEPs).

On or about July 23, 1998, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE)
filed  a  Complaint for Injunctive Relief and Civil Penalty (the Complaint)
against  the Company in the Circuit Court of Worcester County, Md. for  the
alleged  violation  of certain Maryland water pollution control  laws  with
respect  to  the  Company's land application of  sludge  to  Company  owned
agricultural land near Berlin, Md. The MDE seeks, in addition to injunctive
and equitable relief, civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day for each day
the  Company  had  allegedly operated in violation of  the  Maryland  water
pollution  control  laws.   The  Company has  only  recently  received  the
Complaint,  is  reviewing  and  researching the  factual  matters  asserted
therein,  and intends to vigorously defend against the same.   The  Company
does  not believe any penalties, if imposed, would have a material  adverse
effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.

Discussion and Analysis" on pages 16 through 23 of the Annual Report, which
information is incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISKS

      Market  risks  relating to the Company's operations result  primarily
from  changes  in  interest  rates, foreign exchange  rates  and  commodity
prices,  as well as credit risk concentrations. To address these risks  the
Company  enters into various hedging transactions as described  below.  The
Company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes and is  not
a party to any leveraged derivatives.







Commodities Risk

      The Company is a purchaser of certain commodities, primarily corn and
soybeans.   The  Company periodically uses commodity futures and  purchased
options  for  hedging purposes to reduce the effect of  changing  commodity
prices  and  as  a  mechanism to procure the grains.   The  contracts  that
effectively  meet  risk  reductions and correlation criteria  are  recorded
using hedge accounting.  Gains and losses on closed hedge transactions  are
recorded as a component of the underlying inventory purchase.

The  following table provides information about the Company's corn, soybean
oil  and  other  feed ingredient inventory and futures contracts  that  are
sensitive to changes in commodity prices.  The table presents the  carrying
amounts  and fair values at October 3, 1998. Additionally, for the  futures
contracts, the latest which matures 15 months from the reporting date,  the
table  presents  the  notional amounts in units of purchase,  the  weighted
average  contract  prices and the total dollar contract amounts.   Contract
amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments and quantity of corn
and soybean oil to be exchanged under the futures contracts.

Foreign Currency and Interest Rate Risks

       The  Company  periodically  enters  into  foreign  exchange  forward
contracts  and  option  contracts to hedge some  of  its  foreign  currency
exposure.  The Company uses such contracts to hedge exposure to changes  in
foreign currency exchange  rates, primarily Japanese Yen, associated with
sales  denominatedin  foreign currency. Gains and losses on these contracts
are recognized as an adjustment of the subsequent transaction when it occurs.
Forward and option contracts generally have maturities not exceeding 12 months.

      The  Company  also  hedges exposure to changes in interest  rates  on
certain of its financial instruments.  Under the terms of various leveraged
equipment  loans, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements  to
effectively  lock  in  a  fixed interest rate  for  these  borrowings.  The
maturity dates of these leveraged equipment loans range from 2005  to  2008
with interest rates ranging from 4.7% to 6%.


The  following  table  provides information about the Company's  derivative
financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to
changes  in  interest  rates. The table presents  for  the  Company's  debt
obligations, principal cash flows, related weighted-average interest  rates
by  expected maturity dates and fair values. For interest rate  swaps,  the
table  presents notional amounts, weighted-average interest rates or strike
rates  by contractual maturity dates and fair values. Notional amounts  are
used  to  calculate  the contractual cash flows to be exchanged  under  the
contract.

Credit Risks

     The Company's financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables.
The  Company's cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed  with
major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk  with
respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and
their  dispersion  across geographic areas. The Company  performs  periodic
credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally does
not require collateral. No single group or customer represents greater than
10% of total accounts receivable.
